# GDPR_data_collection
With an adoption deadline of May 25th, 2018, the The General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), placed into effect a sweeping set of rules governing data protections and privacy for all residents and citizens of the European Union (EU). Applying to not only European businesses, but all businesses possessing data of European citizens, the GDPR mandates company disclosure of both data practices and user rights for controlling their data. 

Our work is an assessment of the impact of the GDPR on global businesses and users. While our work is still ongoing, we seek to answer questions about the effect of GDPR and found several interesting examples of how firms are responding to the regulation. 

Our presentation will be an early look into our assessment of the impact of GDPR adoption for EU and non-EU businesses and users. We seek to answer the following questions about the impact on businesses: How have businesses modified their privacy and data policies to satisfy GDPR disclosure requirements? How many online businesses are displaying different content for users of different regions (i.e., differentiating EU and non-EU users?) How many businesses disclosed previously unknown data processing practices?
