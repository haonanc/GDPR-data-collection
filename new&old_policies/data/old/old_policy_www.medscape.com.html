<h2>Medscape Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the websites www.medscape.com and www.medscape.org, which are operated by WebMD LLC ("WebMD") and Medscape LLC ("Medscape"), respectively, including the mobile optimized versions of these websites (collectively, the "Sites").  Except where otherwise noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the Sites also apply to the Medscape Device Applications (or "Apps") for iPhone, iPad and Android devices which include Medscape Mobile, Medscape Medpulse and Medscape Business of Medicine. The Sites and Apps are referred to as the "Medscape Network." References to "we," "us" or "our" refer to WebMD and Medscape.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect, use and disclose information about users of the Services. The "Services" for purposes of this Privacy Policy means the Sites, the Apps and all information and services provided to you in connection with your use of the Sites and Apps including, without limitation, news, reference content, tools, applications, sponsored programs, advertising, email communications, continuing medical education and discussion boards. We may share information collected under this Privacy Policy among the respective Sites and Apps that we each own or control, but information collected under this Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>Information That We Collect</h4>
<p>In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss the information we may collect about you in connection with your use of the Services, which can include "Personal Information" (i.e., information that we can use to identify you, such as your name or email address) and "Non-Personal Information" (i.e., information that we do not use to identify you).  As described below, we may associate Non-Personal Information with Personal Information and upon doing so such information will become Personal Information.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Registration</b>. When you register to become a member of the Medscape Network, we request certain Personal Information from you such as your name and email address, zip code, profession, occupation and specialty. You may choose to update and/or supplement the Personal Information that you provided at registration at any time through your account settings.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Public Forums</b>: When you post a comment on a discussion board or other public forum, by default your username, specialty and degree will be displayed along with your comment. You may choose to display additional information in your public forum profile by adjusting your discussion profile settings, and in some instances you may be able to customize your username specifically for commenting purposes. Information that you post within a public forum is public information and may be used by us and third parties, as further described in the Medscape Terms of Use.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sponsored Programs</b>: When you use the Services you may be presented with advertisements and informational programs ("Sponsored Programs"), in each case consisting of content selected by third party sponsors, including pharmaceutical companies. All advertisements and Sponsored Programs (including any links to Sponsored Programs) will be identified to you by the label Advertisement, Information from Industry, Sponsored, WebMD Professional or some similar designation indicating that the content has been selected by a third-party sponsor. Examples of Sponsored Programs include information resources featuring branded or unbranded commercial content, interactive programs that provide information about medical conditions, treatments and products, and multi-media presentations including videos featuring key opinion leaders. We may make Sponsored Programs available to you through email or on-site or in-App media units, all of which will be identified as described above. When you choose to engage in a Sponsored Program, you may be asked to provide Personal Information which may be provided directly to the third-party sponsor and also used by us as described in this Privacy Policy. In addition, you may be presented with polling questions from the sponsor. We also collect Non-Personal Information about your use of Sponsored Programs through cookies and web beacons, as described below.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Market Research</b>: From time to time, we may invite you to participate in market research surveys for WebMD and market research surveys conducted on behalf of third party sponsors either by WebMD or a third party ("Sponsored Surveys"), where in this context "sponsor" means the provider of products and services who commissioned the survey. WebMD surveys may be administered by one of our companies or by a third party acting on our behalf. For some surveys, you may be asked to provide contact information for honoraria fulfillment.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Continuing Medical Education</b>. When you participate in a Continuing Medical Education (CME) or a Continuing Education (CE) activity made available to you through the Medscape Network, you may be asked to provide Personal Information as required by that particular activity.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Tools</b>: Clinical tools may be available through the Services. These tools may require you to provide Personal Information for the tools to operate.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Additional Forms</b>: From time to time we may offer you the opportunity to receive additional information or services from us or from third parties (e.g., sample request, sales rep visit, etc.). If you wish to receive such information, you may be asked to provide additional Personal Information to fulfill the request. We may use such information as described in this Privacy Policy and the third party, if applicable, will use such Personal Information as described at the point of collection.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cookies and Web Beacons.</b>  We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Sites and the Apps, as further described in the Mobile Device Application section, below, through the use of cookies and web beacons. "Cookies" are small data files that we assign to your computer's hard drive when you visit a Site, an App, or open an email.  "Web beacons" are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located and the content viewed, the type of browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.  Most browser software can be set to reject all cookies, however, if you choose to reject cookies then your ability to access and use the Sites and Services will be limited. Please note that your choice to stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer as well please opt out from that computer too.</p>
<p>We use web beacons and cookies to: (i) track usage of the Services; (ii) help us deliver more relevant  advertising and content to users of the Services; (iii) assess which Services our users access; and (iv) track who has opened our emails. If you are a member of the Medscape Network, we may elect to associate our cookies and the information collected by our cookies with your registration information, thereby making the cookie information Personal Information.</p>
<p>Third parties under contract with WebMD may use cookies or web beacons to help WebMD deliver advertising to you on properties within the Medscape Network and on properties outside of the Medscape Network that are not owned and operated by WebMD. Advertisers that market to you through the Services may use their own cookies, web beacons or other online tracking technologies in the sponsored content served to you, including banner advertisements, sponsored links, emails and pages on the Site ("Brand Pages") that consist solely of advertisements or other content from our advertisers. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their sponsored content on their behalf and to monitor users' responses to this content. These companies ("Ad Servers") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of cookies or web beacons. Additionally, an advertiser may include tracking technology in its advertising content delivered on the Medscape Network that would enable the advertiser to obtain Personal Information about you, including the fact that you saw the advertisement, to the extent that you have separately provided consent to the advertiser or to the third party providing the tracking technology. While we generally permit the use of these third party cookies on the assumption that they comply with our Advertising Policy and we assist our advertisers with the placement of cookies or beacons on Brand Pages, we do not have control over these third parties' use of cookies or web beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through them and we may be unable to verify compliance with our Advertising Policy.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Mobile Device Application</b>. You must register with the Medscape Network to access the Apps which means that all information that we collect about your use of the Apps is Personal Information that we may use in the same manner as information about your use of the Sites as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not want us to collect Personal Information about your use of our Apps, then please do not use our Apps. We do not obtain any information about your mobile device other than its brand, make and model and the type of operating software that it uses.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Non-registered Users</b>. You must register with the Medscape Network to access all of the Services, however, you may be able to access certain limited Services without registering. Even if you have not registered, we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Services through the use of cookies.  The Non-Personal Information we collect includes the referring website, if applicable, the type of browser you use, the material viewed, and the time and date that you accessed the Services.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Emails You Send to Us</b>. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to us by email or other non-Site communication. If you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them to us in an email or other non-Site communication such as regular mail.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Information from Third Party Sources</b>. We may also collect additional information about members of the Medscape Network from third party sources to assist us in providing the Services. For example, we may use third party information to verify and update your registration information and to personalize the Services provided to you, including advertising.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>How We May Use Your Information</h4>
<p>In this section of our Privacy Policy, we discuss how we may use the Personal Information and Non-Personal Information that we collect about you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Communications</b>. By registering for the Services, you are consenting to receive certain communications. Specifically, we may use your registration information to send you communications about our products and services and the products and services of our third party sponsors through pop-ups, banners and emails. You may also subscribe to receive certain email newsletters sent to registered users from time to time which you may manage through the newsletter subscriptions area within your account settings.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Marketing and Advertising</b>.  In connect with advertising and marketing activities, WebMD may:
<ul>
<li><p>Target advertising and marketing communications based on information that we collect about your use of the Services and information about you that we obtain from third party sources. For example, a user that WebMD believes is a cardiologist may be served cardiology-related advertisements on both WebMD-owned and third party websites that a user that WebMD believes is a neurologist will not see.  Similarly, a user that WebMD believes is a healthcare professional that treats diabetes may be served advertisements for new diabetes therapies that other users would not see. WebMD serves these ads through the use of cookies and web beacons, as described above. WebMD may also geographically target advertising and marketing communications based on your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.</p></li>
<li><p>Personalize the Services, including the content and advertising that registered users see within the Medscape Network, on third party sites and through other communications such as email, based on their interests. For example, you may see different articles and advertisements in different places on www.medscape.com and in emails that we send to you based on (i) information you have shared with WebMD such as your specialty; (ii) information that WebMD has obtained by observing your previous activity within the Medscape Network; or (iii) information that WebMD has received from third party sources, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p></li>
<li><p>Work with third parties to allow advertisers to serve you ads within the Medscape Network using information that such advertisers have collected from third party sources.  For example, if you looked at an advertisement for an automobile on a third party website you may receive an advertisement for that automobile on a Site through the use of cookies.</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Member Profiles</b>.  As described above, we use web beacons and cookies to track your use of the Services, including content consumption, and may associate this information with other information that we have about you, including Personal Information, thereby creating a profile of you that we may update from time to time ("Member Profile").</p></li>

<li><p><b>Research, Development and Evaluation Activities</b>.  We use information that we collect about users of our Services, including Personal Information, to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the Services (including advertising and Sponsored Programs), to develop new Services and for market analysis. We may combine this information with information that we obtain from third parties.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Account Management</b>. We may use your account information to administer your account, respond to your inquiries you send to us and to send you administrative communications about the Services.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Companies and People Who Work for Us</b>: We each contract with other companies and individuals to help us provide the Services and to otherwise assist us in the operation of our businesses.  For example, we may host one of our Sites on another company's computers, hire technical consultants to maintain our clinical tools, work with companies to analyze data, provide marketing assistance (including assisting us in targeting our advertisements as described herein) or to provide customer service or fulfillment services. In addition, if you are a healthcare professional, we may request that a third party validate your licensure status and other information against available databases of healthcare professionals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may provide these companies and individuals with Personal Information about users of our Services so that they can fulfill their responsibilities to us, however, we do require that they agree to limit their use of this Personal Information to the fulfillment of these responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Aggregated Information</b>. We may provide aggregated information about users of our Services to third parties as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion. For example, WebMD may tell a customer what percentage of registered users of the Medscape Network reside in a particular geographical area or specialize in a particular clinical area, or what percentage of participants in a market research survey selected a particular response to a survey question. We may also use Personal Information to evaluate the performance of an advertising campaign and may provide aggregate outcomes information to the advertiser.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Advertising and Sponsored Programs</b>:  We may provide your Personal Information to third party sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs.  Specifically, when you are exposed to an advertisement through the Services, whether on a Site, in a newsletter or through some other means, or when you engage in a Sponsored Program, e.g., access a sponsored information resource or open a Sponsored Program email from WebMD Professional, WebMD may provide your Personal Information, such as your name and specialty, but not your contact information such as email address and postal address, to the sponsor of the advertisement or Sponsored Program and/or its agents on the sponsor's behalf. We may also provide such third parties with details about your engagement with the advertisement or Sponsored Program (e.g., whether you viewed or otherwise interacted with certain content), your answers to any polling questions contained in the Sponsored Program that you have chosen to provide and information about you that we have received from third parties.  Additionally, when you register as a member of the Medscape Network, we may provide your Personal Information, excluding contact information, to potential sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs that may be offered or provided to you through the Services. We are not responsible for how these third parties use your information and manage your privacy. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Member Profiles</b>.  WebMD may provide Member Profiles (excluding contact information, such as email address and postal address, and information about your participation in specific named CME and CE activities) to third parties, including our pharmaceutical manufacturer customers, which they may use for their business purposes including marketing. We require these third parties to agree that they will use Member Profiles in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. By registering as a member of the Medscape Network and using the Services, you consent to WebMD's disclosure of your Member Profiles to third parties as described herein.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Market Research Surveys</b>: If you receive remuneration for participating in a Sponsored Survey, we may be required to provide the sponsor (or the market research company acting on its behalf) with your Personal Information for the sponsor's recordkeeping and/or regulatory reporting purposes. If you chose to access a Sponsored Survey that is conducted by a third party market research company, we may identify you to this company through the survey link.  Sometimes market research companies send us lists of individuals they wish to reach with particular Sponsored Surveys, and we may inform these companies which of these individuals are members of the Medscape Network so that they can manage their survey recruitment needs accordingly.  Also, certain market research survey opportunities made available to you through the Services require the market research company to contact you directly to conduct the Sponsored Survey.
