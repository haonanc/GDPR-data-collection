Our policy is divided into two sections: Section 1 describes how we collect and use data from users of Observer Media websites. Section 2 describes how we collect and use data from subscribers to the print and electronic editions of the <em>New York Observer</em>&nbsp;newspaper. We also encourage you to review our <a href="/web/20180122221029/http://www.observermedia.com/terms">Terms of Service</a> for information regarding rights, usage, trademarks, licenses, liability, trademark, and content ownership.</p><p>We reevaluate this policy on an ongoing basis, and we value your feedback. If you have questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, we ask that you contact us at:</p><p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br/><em>The New York Observer, LLC</em><br/>One Whitehall Street, Floor 7<br/>New York, NY 10004<br/>(212) 755-2400<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180122221029/mailto:customerservice@observer.com">Email</a></p><p>Please note that this privacy policy may change from time to time. We will post the new policy on this page, and, if the changes allow us to use personally identifying information in ways that are different from the ways specified at the time the information was originally collected, our website will contain a special notice about the changes. Each version of this privacy policy will be identified by its effective date, which you can find at the bottom of the page.</p><p><em>New York Observer</em>&nbsp;Online Privacy Policy</p><p><em>New York Observer</em>&nbsp;collects data, including personally identifying information, from people who use Observer Media websites. This section of our privacy policy explains how we collect and use this data.
