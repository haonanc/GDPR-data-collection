Additionally, for quality and training purposes or for its own protection, PayPal may monitor or record its telephone conversations with you or anyone acting on your behalf.

The information we may receive varies by site and is controlled by that site. By associating an account managed by a third party with your PayPal account and authorizing PayPal to have access to this information, you agree that PayPal may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>Authentication and Fraud Detection:</strong>&nbsp;In order to help protect you from fraud and misuse of your personal information, we may collect information about you and your interactions with PayPal Services.

These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, e-tags, &quot;Flash cookies,&quot; or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively &quot;Cookies&quot;). We use these technologies to recognize you as a customer; customize PayPal Services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness; help ensure that your account security is not compromised; mitigate risk and prevent fraud; and to promote trust and safety across our sites and PayPal Services.</p> <p>You are free to decline our Cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, unless our Cookies are required to prevent fraud or ensure the security of websites we control. However, declining our Cookies may interfere with your use of our website and PayPal Services.</p> <p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong>&nbsp;Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties.

We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous so that it does not identify a specific user.</p> <p>Our operations are supported by a network of computers, cloud-based servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, the use of third-party service providers. We, and third-party service providers on our behalf, store and process your personal information in the United States and elsewhere in the world. If your information is transferred to other countries, including countries which may not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in your country, we will protect the information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>We protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to data centers, and information access authorization&nbsp;controls.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <p><a id="How_We_Share_Personal_Information_with_Other_PayPal_Users" name="How_We_Share_Personal_Information_with_Other_PayPal_Users"></a></p> <h3>How We Share Personal Information with Other PayPal Users</h3> <p>When transacting with others, we may provide those parties with information about you necessary to complete the transaction, such as your name, account ID, contact details, shipping and billing address, or other information needed to promote the reliability and security of the transaction. If a transaction is held, fails, or is later invalidated, we may also provide details of the unsuccessful transaction. To facilitate dispute resolution, we may provide a buyer with the seller&rsquo;s address so that goods can be returned to the seller. The receiving party is not allowed to use this information for unrelated purposes, such as to directly market to you, unless you have agreed to it. Contacting users with unwanted or threatening messages is against our policies and constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.</p> <p>If someone is sending you money and enters your email address or phone number, we will provide them your registered name so they can verify they are sending the money to the correct account.</p> <p>We work with third parties, including merchants, to enable them to accept or send payments from or to you using PayPal. In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, to inform you that a payment has been sent to you or when you attempt to pay a merchant or third party. We use this information to confirm that you are a PayPal customer and that PayPal as a form of payment can be enabled, or to send you notification of payment status. Also, if you request that we validate your status as a PayPal customer with a third party, we will do so.</p> <p>If you link your loyalty or gift card of a PayPal merchant to your account, we may share your card number with that merchant when you pay using PayPal.</p> <p>Please note that merchants, sellers, and users you buy from or contract with have their own privacy policies, and although PayPal&rsquo;s user agreement does not allow the other transacting party to use this information for anything other than providing PayPal Services, PayPal is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.</p> <p>Regardless, we will not disclose your credit card number or bank account number to anyone you have paid or who has paid you using PayPal, or with the third parties that offer or use PayPal Services, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with credit card rules, a subpoena, or other legal process.</p> <p align="right"><a href="#top"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> <h3><a id="How_We_Share_Personal_Information_with_Other_Third_Parties" name="How_We_Share_Personal_Information_with_Other_Third_Parties"></a></h3> <h3>How We Share Personal Information with Other Third Parties</h3> <p>We may share your personal information we collect from you, including your name, contact details, and transactions and activities, with:</p> <ul> <li>Members of the PayPal corporate family, such as PayPal Credit, Venmo or Braintree, to provide joint content, products, and services (such as registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services, and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services. Financial institutions that we partner with to jointly create and offer a product (including but not limited to, the PayPal&nbsp;Extras credit card where we share information with Synchrony Bank, for example, in connection with pre-approved offers for the PayPal Extras credit card). These financial institutions may only use this information to market PayPal-related products, unless you have given consent for other uses.</li> <li>Credit bureaus and collection agencies to report account information, as permitted by law.</li> <li>Banking partners as required by credit card association rules for inclusion on their list of terminated merchants (in the event that you meet their criteria which includes having PayPal close your PayPal Account due to your breach of the PayPal User Agreement).</li> <li>Companies that we plan to merge with or are acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)</li> <li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties pursuant to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process or requirement applicable to PayPal or one of its affiliates; when we need to do so to comply with law or credit card rules; or when we believe, in our sole discretion, that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.</li> <li>Other unaffiliated third parties, for the following purposes: <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> <li><u>Fraud Prevention and Risk Management</u>: to help prevent fraud or assess and manage risk.&nbsp; For example, if you use the PayPal Services to buy or sell goods using eBay Inc. or its affiliates (&ldquo;eBay&rdquo;), we may share account information in order to help protect your accounts from fraudulent activity, alert you if we detect such fraudulent activity on your accounts, or evaluate credit risk.<br/> <br/> As part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we also may share necessary account information with eBay in cases where PayPal has placed a hold or other restriction on your account based on disputes, claims, chargebacks or other scenarios regarding the sale or purchase of goods. Also, as part of our fraud prevention and risk management efforts, we may share account information with eBay to enable them to operate their programs for evaluating buyers or sellers.</li> <li><u>Customer Service</u>: for customer service purposes, including to help service your accounts or resolve disputes (e.g., billing or transactional).&nbsp;</li> <li><u>Shipping</u>: in connection with shipping and related services for purchases made using PayPal.&nbsp;</li> <li><u>Legal Compliance</u>: to help them comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing verification requirements.</li> <li><u>Service Providers</u>: to enable service providers under contract with us to support our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, customer service and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li> </ul> <p>Please note that these third parties may be in other countries where the laws on processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.</p> <p>If you open a PayPal account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a PayPal website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with personal information.
