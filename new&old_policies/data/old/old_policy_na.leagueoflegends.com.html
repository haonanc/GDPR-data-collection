<br/><p>
    Welcome to Riot Games!  Our privacy policy explains what info Riot Games collects when you visit the Riot services, as well as ways we might use or share it.  Note that we’re only describing our own practices – this policy doesn’t apply to third parties, including other companies you might interact with on or through the Riot services (see <a href="#third-party">Third-Party Websites and Services</a>).
</p>
<p>
    When we say “Riot Games,” we’re referring to Riot Games, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  We’re a global gaming company headquartered in Los Angeles with offices and operations around the world (see <a href="#international-data">International Data Processing</a>).  When we reference “the Riot services,” we mean League of Legends and any other games, websites, applications, and services that link to this policy, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices.
</p>

This means your visit is also subject to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> (including its provisions regarding limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of governing law).  Please review all relevant terms, and make sure you understand and agree to them, before using the Riot services.

    READ THIS ENTIRE POLICY CAREFULLY!  BY USING THE RIOT SERVICES, YOU’RE AGREEING TO THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED BELOW.
</p>
<p>
    We encourage you to use the policy’s interactive features to guide you.  We’ve written summaries to identify the key issues discussed in many sections at a glance; <strong><em>however, note that these summaries are intended solely for your convenience and the full policy controls in the event of any conflicts (so be sure to read the whole thing carefully!)</em></strong>.

        <p>
            <strong>Summary:</strong>  We collect data you choose to provide or give to us in any manner.  You don’t have to share personal info when we ask you for it, but if you decline, you might not be able to access certain Riot services or take advantage of their full functionality.
        </p>

                <p>
                    For example, you’ll need a valid Riot Games account to play League of Legends and access parts of our websites.  If you’d like to create one, we’ll ask you to complete our online <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/https://signup.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/index?realm_key=na">registration form</a>, which requests info like a unique username and password, your email address, and your date of birth.  You’ll also need to choose a public-facing Summoner Name to associate with certain account activity, like your in-game performance and forum posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ask you for payment-related info to process purchases you make on the Riot services (see <a href="#what-info">What Info We Collect</a>).  In most cases, we’ll also need to share that info with third-party vendors (like PayOn) to facilitate payment processing (see <a href="#third-party">Vendors and Service Providers</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other common ways you might provide us with info include: responding to surveys; participating in contests or similar promotions; requesting products or services from us; and using interactive features like forums or in-game chat.

            B. Info We Collect Automatically
        </h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Summary:</strong> We and our partners also automatically record some info about how you use and navigate the Riot services, including through technologies like cookies.  Among other things, this helps us analyze, improve, and secure the Riot services, as well as support our advertising efforts.  We may combine automatically-collected info with other info we gather from or about you as described in this policy.

        <br/><div id="accordion" class="ui-accordion">

                <p>
                    <em>(1) LOG FILES</em>.  We automatically gather info about the ways you interact with the Riot services and store it in log files.  This may include, for example, Usage Info (see <a href="#what-info">What Info We Collect</a>) about your visit, like data that your device or browser sends to us when you access the Riot services and details about how you use your Riot Games account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>(2) COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</em>. “Cookies” are small pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping purposes.  “Web beacons” are transparent pixel images that allow online services to collect info about the ways you interact with them (like whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an ad).  Other common tracking technologies include things like tags, scripts, local shared objects (e.g., Flash cookies), local storage (e.g., HTML5), and similar tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Riot services use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to automatically collect, store, and read files on your device.  They may be delivered in a first-party (i.e., by Riot Games) or third-party (i.e., by other companies) context.  These tools help the Riot services work and operate more efficiently, as well as capture Usage Info (see <a href="#what-info">What Info We Collect</a>) and similar data about your browsing experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use info gathered through tracking technologies for several reasons, including:
                </p>
                <ul><li>
                        To monitor, secure, and maintain the Riot services;
                    </li><br/><li>
                        To enhance your browsing experience;
                    </li><br/><li>
                        To analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns);
                    </li><br/><li>
                        To control the display of ads, including providing you with targeted offers;
                    </li><br/><li>
                        To support and gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns (like letting us know if you’ve clicked on our ads or opened our emails);
                    </li><br/><li>
                        To better personalize your visit and store your preferences and settings; and
                    </li><br/><li>
                        To otherwise manage our relationship with players.
                    </li>
                </ul><p>
                    You can learn more about cookies, including details of how to manage or disable them, by visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://aboutcookies.org/">http://aboutcookies.org/</a> or consulting your browser’s privacy features.  Some ways of managing traditional cookies may not impact the use of other tracking technologies, but certain browsers may offer their own tools for removing HTML5.  For additional details about managing Flash cookies, click <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">here</a>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that disabling tracking technologies may prevent you from using the full functionality of the Riot services and they may not work as we intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>(3)  ANALYTICS PROVIDERS AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</em>.  In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit the Riot services.  This includes vendors we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website analytics), as well as third parties that deliver content (like videos from YouTube) or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the Riot services.  We may receive reports based on our partners’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, we use third-party analytics providers like Google Analytics to help evaluate and report on use of the Riot services.  These companies may set and read their own tracking technologies to gather info about your online activities across websites and services.  Some analytics providers offer you choices about how they collect and use data directly on their websites.  To learn more about opting out of Google Analytics, click <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored to your likely interests (such as based on your browsing activity on the Riot services or when visiting other online services).  If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that such tracking technologies provide, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info</a> or  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://youradchoices.ca/">http://youradchoices.ca/</a> respectively. Please note that opting-out of interest-based advertising won’t necessarily entirely prevent info from being collected automatically on the Riot services, and it doesn’t mean you’ll receive fewer ads or stop them from being displayed.  Instead, the ads you do receive won’t be interest-based any longer and therefore might be less relevant to your interests.

            <strong>Summary:</strong>  We use and share non-personal info for many of the same reasons as personal info: it helps us operate our business, provide and improve our products and services, and advertise effectively.   Because it doesn’t personally identify you, we often process non-personal info to support our operations in different ways as well.

            We’ve empowered the League of Legends community to help police compliance with our policies related to in-game behavior.  Players may report each other and submit descriptions of their in-game activity and actions, and in certain cases, collectively determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to player conduct.

                <ul><li>
                        <em>External Links</em>.  If you click on links to external websites or services that are operated by third parties, they may collect, use, and share your personal info pursuant to their own policies (not ours).  Including a link to or from third-party services doesn’t mean we’ve endorsed their practices.
                    </li><br/><li>
                        <em>Payment Processing</em>.  Depending on your selected payment method and region of the world, payment-related info you provide may be collected directly by third-parties and subject to their privacy policy.  For example, to make purchases using PayPal, you’ll need to share payment info with PayPal directly and PayPal’s use of your info will be subject to PayPal’s privacy policy.
                    </li><br/><li>
                        <em>Account Integrations &amp; Social Media Features</em>.  The Riot services use interfaces that allow you interact with third-party websites, applications, or similar services during your visit, including on or through your Riot Games account or an account you’ve created with such third parties.  For example, we partner with social media companies to provide features that facilitate social sharing and connections (such as the Facebook “Like” button and other widgets).  These features may collect info about your interactions with them and the Riot services, and may use tracking technologies like cookies to function properly.  How social media companies process your info is controlled by their own privacy policies.
                    </li><br/><li>
                        <em>Third-Party Tracking</em>.  The Riot services contain cookies, web beacons, and other common tracking technologies that help us collect and analyze info in connection with your visit (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>). Third parties (like analytics providers or ad networks) may set and read their own tracking technologies on the Riot services.  If they do, they’re responsible for using these tools as described in their respective privacy policies.

                </ul><p>
                    Please remember to contact third parties directly (and not Riot Games) if you have any questions or concerns about their practices.

                    Some newer Internet browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features.  If activated, these features often send a signal to the services you visit indicating that you don’t want to be tracked in some way.

If you do provide us with personal info, we generally retain it as long as your account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the Riot services and operate our business (including for purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this policy and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>), unless a longer retention period is permitted or required by law.  You can also limit the personal info you share with third parties, such as by choosing not to link your Riot Games account with third-party services (see <a href="#third-party">"Third-Party Websites And Services).
                    </a></li><br/><li>
                        <em>Access your personal info.</em>   You can request access to the personal info we hold about you by visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://privacy.riotgames.com/">privacy.riotgames.com</a> and following the instructions provided. You can also submit any account-related questions or concerns you may have (including access requests) directly to our Player Support team (see <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>).  Before we process your request, we may ask you to verify your identity (like by logging-in to your account or providing us with certain personal info to help us confirm ownership) and we may request payment where allowed by law.
                    </li><br/><li>
                        <em>•	Correct or delete your personal info.</em>   If you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your personal info, or would like to ask that we update or delete it, please direct your request to Player Support (see <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>).  We’ll respond to requests to access, correct, or delete your personal info within 30 days.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal info, but we’ll let you know why.  Note that requesting deletion of your personal info may also result in account termination.
                    </li><br/><li>
                        <em>Update your communication preferences.</em>  While we offer players the option to receive updates and promotional communications from Riot Games, you can change your preferences at any time.  To opt-out, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions in any of our promotional emails.  These choices don’t apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Riot services, like important account-related notices.

                        <em>Change your browser settings.</em>  Many Internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies.  You may also be able to manage other forms of tracking technologies, like HTML5, by changing your browser settings (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>).

                        <em>Control third-party tracking.</em>  Ad companies, analytics providers, and similar third parties place their own tracking technologies on the Riot services (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>). If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that such tracking technologies provide, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180202214001/http://youradchoices.ca/">http://youradchoices.ca/</a> respectively.

                        <em>Update your third-party privacy settings.</em>  If you authorize third-party services to share info with us, you may be able to control the types of info they make available by directly updating your privacy settings on their service.  For example, if you link your social media account with the Riot services, your privacy settings on the social media company’s service determine what info we receive (see <a href="#info-other">Other Sources</a>).
