<h2 id="collect">Information We Collect</h2>

<p>CareerBuilder collects Personal Information in a fair and lawful way, for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. The types of information we generally may obtain can include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Personal Information provided by you (such as via a resume uploaded to our Site or a job application sent using our Site) or collected from third party sources as described below.</li>
	<li>Publically available data about you from third party sites and sources, including profiles created by you on other websites, or other information you have publicly shared for the purpose of advertising or informing others about your background.</li>
	<li>Username and password for the account you may establish on our Sites.</li>
	<li>Payment details (including payment card number, security code, expiration date, cardholder name and billing address) if you buy products on our Sites.</li>
	<li>Your demographic information (such as zip or postal code, occupation, education and experience, and if you choose to provide it, age, gender and race or ethnicity). We collect this information either through the registration process, from your resume or in the manner described below.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Job search behavior and preferences, and a record of the searches that you make on our Sites.</li>
	<li>Other details that you may submit to us or that may be included in the information provided to us by third parties.</li>

<p>We may obtain information about you from various sources, including directly from you via our Sites, when you call or email us or communicate with us through social media, or when you participate in events, contests or other promotions.&nbsp; We also may obtain information about you from our parent, affiliate or subsidiary companies, business partners and other third parties, as well as from publicly available information.</p>

<p>Many people invest significant time and energy to promote their professional reputation through public forums on the Internet.&nbsp; We gather information relevant to your career history and work experience from these widely dispersed publicly available sources, including social media sites you may be part of, forming a &ldquo;Profile.&rdquo;&nbsp; We make this Profile available to independent and company-specific recruiters for recruitment leads in a database known as &ldquo;Recruitment Edge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although we may generate a Profile about you based on publicly available information even if you do not have a CareerBuilder account, we also will include the information that you provide to us via your CareerBuilder account. &nbsp;Use of these Profiles are limited to recruitment lead generation and may not be used for determinations about employment or other eligibility.&nbsp; You can learn more about our Recruitment Edge product at our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180228054836/http://edge.careerbuilder.com/faq" target="_blank">Edge FAQ Page</a>.&nbsp; If you would prefer that we not compile and make this information available to recruiters, you can opt-out of this service <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180228054836/http://edge.careerbuilder.com/optout" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CareerBuilder provides software applications (&ldquo;Apps&rdquo;) available to the public.&nbsp; If you decide to download one of our Apps, and if you authorize us to do so, we will collect your social media profile information, including your social network site user ID, work email address, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.&nbsp; You may be asked to enter this information directly, or we can automatically collect it by syncing to your social media profiles.&nbsp; We request this information so that we may automate completion of registration forms or job applications with information stored in your social media profile. &nbsp;In addition, when you visit our Sites or use our Apps, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons or as provided to the app by your device&rsquo;s operating system, as described in more detail <a href="#cookies">below</a>.&nbsp; The information we may collect automatically via the Sites can include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Information about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser and operating system type and other operating system support information).</li>
	<li>Pages and URLs that refer visitors to our Sites, also pages and URLs that visitors exit to once they leave our Sites.</li>
	<li>Dates and times of visits to our Sites.</li>
	<li>Information on actions taken on our Sites (such as page views, site navigation patterns and job view or application activity).</li>
	<li>A general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our Sites.</li>
	<li>Search terms that visitors use to reach our Sites.<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>

<h2 id="info-share">Information We Share</h2>

<p>We share the information that we collect from you or from third party sources with our affiliated companies, recruiters, educators and service providers.&nbsp; In the normal course of performing services for our clients, Personal Information may be shared within CareerBuilder and its affiliates for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy; as well as research and statistical purposes, system administration and crime prevention or detection.</p>

<p>Recruiters may use your information to contact you directly.&nbsp; Additionally, when you apply for a job with a company through the Sites, the information supplied by you or shared through CareerBuilder products and services may become part of such company&rsquo;s database.&nbsp; Similarly, if your CareerBuilder resume or your Profile is downloaded by a recruiter, your information may become a part of their database.&nbsp; In these instances, the use of such information by the recruiter will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company&rsquo;s use of your information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is &ldquo;hosted&rdquo; or &ldquo;co-branded&rdquo; by another company then that information will be made available to both CareerBuilder and the hosting/co-branding company.&nbsp; CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information.&nbsp; You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All users should be aware that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers are required by contract or law to only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law. Where we have knowledge that a service provider or partner is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with this Policy, CareerBuilder will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such improper use and/or disclosure.</p>

<p>CareerBuilder preserves the right to disclose without your prior permission any Personal Information about you or your use of this Site if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of CareerBuilder, employees, other users of the Sites, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of the Sites; (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent governmental authority; or (d) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose Personal Information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.</p>

<p>In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>

<p>We may combine certain non-personally identifiable Aggregate Data, or otherwise anonymized or de-identified data about our users and use such data to prepare reports for our users (typically recruiters or educators).&nbsp; &ldquo;Aggregate Data&rdquo; is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.&nbsp; Aggregate Data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.&nbsp; We may also use and share anonymized or de-identified data to track trends in the labor market as well as use of our products and services. &nbsp;Some Aggregate Data analytics reports can be used to better understand individual Profiles.&nbsp; For example, our Recruitment Edge product provides aggregate data trends on the longevity of specific career positions to allow recruiters to identify Profiles of individuals who may be more likely to be interested in making a career move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also use third party analytics services to help better understand the use of our sites, which is further described in the Cookies section <a href="#cookies">below</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Return to Top</a></p>

<h2 id="privacy-options">Privacy Options for Resume Database</h2>

<p>Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of recruiters with open positions each day.&nbsp; When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply.&nbsp; When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.</p>

<p>We know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to publicly posting their resume on the Internet.&nbsp; To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 2 levels of resume privacy from which you can choose.&nbsp; Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume is publicly available to third parties.&nbsp; CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose Personal Information, as well as anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Standard Posting on the Searchable Database</strong><br/>
	When you post your resume to the Sites, it will automatically be visible to employers unless you opt out of this default option and make your resume private (described below).&nbsp; The standard posting option gives you the most visibility to the broadest recruiter audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database.&nbsp; If you select this option, any registered company (or individual recruiter) user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume).&nbsp;<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Private Posting </strong><br/>
	Private posting prevents your resume from being searchable by recruiters in the CareerBuilder resume database.&nbsp; The benefit of uploading a private resume is that you can quickly and easily apply for specific jobs with the resume that you have on file without retyping your information.&nbsp;<br/>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>We attempt to limit access to our searchable databases to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to these searchable databases.&nbsp; While we limit access and use of information from our products and services in our Terms and Conditions, <strong>we cannot control the use of information by third parties once they obtain that information from our products and services or other publicly available sources.</strong>&nbsp; Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume or to a public website.</p>

<h2 id="review">Review, Update or Delete Your Account Information or Profile&nbsp;</h2>

<p>CareerBuilder takes reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is reliable for its intended use; as well as being current, accurate, and complete. As part of maintaining Personal Information which is accurate, current, and complete; we need your help. If you know that your Personal Information which you have provided to us is no longer accurate or complete, and you cannot update or correct the data via the Sites, please let us know by contacting us via the point of contact described. We cannot be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information whose source CareerBuilder does not control.</p>

<p>You may access, update and amend Personal Information included in your online CareerBuilder account or remove your resume from our resume database at any time by logging into your account and making the necessary changes.&nbsp; You may also delete your account, including your Personal Information and any resumes, from our resume database at any time by logging in to your account and making an account deletion request.&nbsp; Deleting your CareerBuilder account will remove your Personal Information and resumes from our resume database.&nbsp; However, it will not delete your Recruitment Edge Profile. &nbsp;You must specifically request the deletion of your Recruitment Edge Profile by opting out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180228054836/http://edge.careerbuilder.com/optout" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may also request a copy of your Recruitment Edge Profile to review, edit or update by contacting us at 1.800.891.8880 or emailing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180228054836/mailto:clientsupport@careerbuilder.com">clientsupport@careerbuilder.com</a>. &nbsp;Please note that when you request the deletion of your Profile, we will use the email address you provide in the opt-out process to match you to your Profile.&nbsp; Therefore, you will need to submit your request using the email address listed on your Profile or we will not be able to complete your request. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Please be advised that, even in the event of a successful account or Profile deletion, recruiters and others who have paid for access to our databases, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to our databases may have retained a copy of your resume or Profile information in their own files or databases.&nbsp; Additionally, if you have applied to a job at a particular company in the past, that company will still have access to your resume.&nbsp; We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or Profiles that have been downloaded by third parties, and, you will not be able to delete data held by third parties that already have accessed and downloaded your Profile information or resume.&nbsp; In addition, we will retain anonymous Aggregate Data for uses described in this privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please allow up to thirty days to process your account or Profile deletion request.</p>
