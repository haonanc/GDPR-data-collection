Cookies and Targeted Advertising</h3><p><strong>A. Cookies, Web Beacons, and IP Address Information</strong><ul><li>"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website places on your browser when you visit that website. We may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Sites and Services. For example, we may use cookies to control what advertisements you see, the sequence of advertisements and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times. For contests or sweepstakes, we may also use cookies in order to track your progress and the number of entries in some promotions. For polls, we may use cookies to help ensure that an individual can't vote more than once on a particular question or issue. We do not store Personal Information in any cookies on your computer.<li>Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser's directions usually within the help menu. In order to use certain Services offered through the Sites, your web browser must accept cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, some aspects of the Sites may not work properly, and you may not be able to access our Services.<li>We may also use cookies, pixels, web beacons (which are usually small, transparent graphic images), operating system and device information and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit, the features and information for which you searched and viewed, the email you opened, or on which advertisements you clicked. This type of information is collected to make the Sites and Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.<li>An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We, or our service providers, may use your IP Address when you access the Sites or Services or use other means to assist with delivering geographically targeted advertisements.</ul><p><strong>B. Targeted Advertising</strong><p>Companies Everyday Health works with may use cookies for purposes including understanding Web usage patterns of users who see advertisements on the Sites, controlling the sequence of advertisements you see, making sure you don't see the same advertisement too many times, determining your interests and tailoring advertisements and promotions based on those interests.<p>For example, if you read an article about a particular health condition on the Sites, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a product related to the viewed article. These third-party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on our Sites with information about pages you visit on other websites and media channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. The advertisement may appear when you are visiting a different section of this Site or another website or media channel if the website or media channel also has a relationship with us or our vendor.<p>You can choose to limit Behavioral Advertising on the Sites by clicking <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20180125044913/https://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>here</strong></a> and opting-out of cookies placed by those vendors listed. After you opt-out, you will still see advertisements but the advertising may not be as relevant to your interests. If you change your computer, change your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out. Our Sites currently are not setup to process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals from web browsers or similar mechanisms. We do adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more information click <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20180125044913/https://www.aboutads.info/consumers"><strong>here</strong></a>).<p>We may use Facebook to deliver ads on the Everyday Health site and mobile app. Facebook may use information you share on Facebook and information gathered from your use of other websites and apps to delivery ads to you.

To prohibit the serving of interest-based advertisements, users can enable "Limit Ad Tracking" (iOS only), or "Opt out of interest-based ads" (Android only) in their device settings.<p><strong>C. Information Collected by Third-Party Advertisers</strong><p>Advertisers or other third parties on the Sites may also engage in Behavioral Advertising and use cookies and web beacons in the manner described above. We do not control these advertisers or other parties' use of cookies or web beacons or what they do with the information they collect. Many third party vendors that engage in Behavioral Advertising participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and abide by NAI and/or DAA principles. If you wish to opt out of participating in advertising programs conducted by NAI and DAA members or learn more about the NAI and DAA, please go to the <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20180125044913/https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><strong>NAI Opt-Out</strong></a> website and <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20180125044913/https://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>DAA Choice Page</strong></a> and follow the instructions.
