    <p class="MsoNormal eula-4"><b><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3' id="aa">1.         Our Policy’s Aims</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.1     The Avast Privacy Policy applies to Avast Software s.r.o. ("Avast") and unless specified, its subsidiaries, including AVG, Piriform (“CCleaner”), Privax Ltd (“HideMyAss!”), AVG Technologies Norway AS, TuneUp Software GmbH, and Jumpshot, Inc., and any contractors, representatives, agents, and resellers while they are working on our behalf (collectively “we,” “us” or “our”).</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.2     Our Privacy Policy explains the processing of your personal data by us and establishes what information we collect, or which is provided to us, and how we use and protect your personal data in compliance with applicable law.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.3     Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”), where this identification can be made directly or indirectly, by means of identifiers such as your name, identification number, email address, phone number, online identifiers such as cookies in some circumstances, your location, your genetic, economic, cultural or social identity or other information that is specific to you.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.4     We do not mean information that only refers to a business corporation or organization. We also do not mean information that has been "anonymized," either by removing or de-identifying all specific identifiers. Anonymous data is not personal data when the anonymization is irreversible. When we refer to anonymous data, we mean data that cannot be reversed into personal data.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.5     As a data controller, we commit ourselves to protecting the privacy of our website visitors and users of our products and services with respect to the processing of your personal data.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.6     Where we collect and process your personal data, we will limit the collection and retention to what is adequate, relevant and necessary for our purposes and it will be kept in a form which allows for your identification no longer than necessary for the purpose for which we process your personal data. We refer to this as data minimisation.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.7     Where we store your personal data for longer periods for statistical purposes, as permitted, we will use appropriate safeguards.  Applicable law defines ‘statistical purpose’ as any collection of personal data, where the result of processing is for aggregate data, so the personal data we collect from you is anonymized or pseudonymized. For example, the processing of your personal data may be for the business-related process of counting users, products, sales and various metrics.  We also share statistical data that has been anonymized and aggregated geographically and so, cannot be used to identify individuals, with third parties for trend analytics.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.8     Our policy provides you with the legal bases for the collection of your personal data, lets you know how long personal data is stored and the reasons why, and how in some circumstances, they are necessary to retain. The length of this retention and how you may choose to request that we delete some or all your personal data and the consequences of the deletion are explained in this policy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.9     Some of the legal bases we rely on are contractual and service necessity, consent, legitimate interests and compliance with legal obligations.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.10   We want you to have the necessary and relevant understanding of how and why we process your personal data so that you can make fully informed decisions on whether to allow us to retain your personal data or delete them. Section 2 explains your rights under applicable law and section 3 lets you know when the Privacy Policy applies.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.11   We strive to keep the policy easy to understand and transparent, and so we refrain from technical information overload. If you wish to have further details on how we process your personal data, please contact us.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-4"></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-4"><b><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3' id="bb">2.       Talk to Us about Your Data</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.1     We try to ensure that the users of our products and services always have an open line of communication with us. You can contact us at any time if you any questions, queries or requests about your personal data and, if European law applies to the processing of your data, about your right to request access to, modify, remove or export your data, or object to our processing of your data. We appreciate if you reach out to us first before you approach any supervisory authorities or courts.   </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.2     In order to make it easier for you to reach out to us and obtain the necessary information and action changes, corrections or deletions of your personal data, we have decided to provide you with a privacy preference portal.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.3     Aside from the privacy preference portal, you can also submit your requests through more traditional channels. We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a data subject. Should we be inundated with requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to settle the matter informally.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-7"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.4     There could be instances where you are using our products or services, but we do not have your personal data, even though you have purchased our products or services. These include situations where you purchase our products from our service provider, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that service provider, reseller or an app store, we do not actually have your personal data and will not be able to perform your request to access or delete your information. In such circumstances, please contact your service provider, reseller, or app store where you purchased the products or services, as this person is the primary controller of your personal data.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-1'>The portal is for your convenience only. It is generally read only.  This means, you are able to see your choices but not able to edit your choices in the portal.  To edit your choices, you need to do so in the applicable product settings. </span></p>

  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>The source of the personal data described above is usually our communication with your company (organization) or directly with you, or publically available sources, such as websites, if your company (organization) or you published this data.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>Avast, as a general rule, does not share personal data with any third parties. There may, however, be specific situations when your information, including potentially your personal data, could be published by Avast, but only if you have consented to it (for instance, as a distributor, reseller or a representative of a reseller or distributor in the Partner Locator Portal). At the same time, “third parties” do not include (i) other companies within the Avast group, (ii) Avast’s processors, (iii) service providers, if this is necessary in order to perform our contract with you or them, or (iv) legal, financial or other expert advisor or counsel, and Avast may, as the situation or nature of your relationship with Avast requires, share your personal data with these entities.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>If we are obligated to do so by law or where we are defending our rights and legitimate interests, for instance, in case of potential legal claims, we may have to share your personal data with third parties, such as the relevant state authorities or courts.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>We will store your personal data for as long as they are relevant to Avast. Where the processing of your personal data is based on consent, we will erase your personal data without undue delay after you have withdrawn it, unless we need those personal data for other legitimate reasons.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>Due to the fact that Avast operates as a global business, your personal data may be transferred to countries outside of the European Economic Area, which have different legal rules concerning protection of your personal data. That being said, our data collection and management practices do not vary by location. We follow the same data protection standards as are granted to residents of the European Union with respect to all personal data in our possession.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>As regards our general approach to transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area, regardless of whether data is being transferred to another Avast entity or a party that is not a member of our group, Avast puts in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-10"><span class='eula-8'>·</span> <b><span class='eula-9'>Obligatory Statement</span></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNoSpacing eula-4"><span class='eula-3'>You have the right to information about whether and how Avast processes your personal data, the right of access to your personal data, and the right to rectification and erasure of personal data or restriction of processing. You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data as well as the right to data portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.
