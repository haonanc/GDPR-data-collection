      "text" : "This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the web sites of Indeed (referred to in this policy as &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;us&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;our&amp;quot;). &amp;quot;Cookies&amp;quot; are text-only pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive or other web site-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the web site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the &amp;quot;lifetime&amp;quot; of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Like most web sites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your on line experience. Two types of cookies are used on this website:   Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site   Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the site to help customize your Indeed web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances. Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser.   For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows Explorer:   Open 'Windows Explorer' Click on the 'Search' button on the tool bar Type &amp;quot;cookie&amp;quot; into the search box for 'Folders and Files' Select 'My Computer' in the 'Look In' box Click 'Search Now' Double click on the folders that are found 'Select' any cookie file Hit the 'Delete' button on your keyboard   If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select &amp;quot;cookies&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot; function for information on where to find your cookie folder If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this web site.   Indeed uses the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to Indeed web sites. This means that vendors including Google will display Indeed promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet.   You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including AdWords and opt-out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager. To provide web site visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google&rsquo;s programs.  Changes To Our Cookie Policy From time to time, it may be necessary for us to change this cookie policy. We suggest that you check here periodically for any changes.  Indeed Inc. has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of personal data collected about you through the Indeed website. This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2012. You may contact Indeed at 177 Broad Street, Stamford, CT 06901, USA or via our website contact form. The following discloses Indeed's information gathering, use and dissemination practices for its website.  1. Information Collected and Utilized Indeed may collect or receive information about you when you register with the Indeed website or submit information, including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume. Indeed may collect information on the Indeed website pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers. Indeed may also record actions taken on its websites including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. Indeed may store this information on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that it has a relationship with for that purpose. Please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users are not encrypted. We strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.  2. Uses of Information Indeed may use the information we collect or receive from you to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience for you and potential employers and for all legal purposes. The purposes for which Indeed uses this information are set forth in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Privacy Policy. Indeed uses this information, including but not limited to your resume, searches, clicks, applications, messages and postings to provide our services and features to you, to provide your information to employers that may be interested in employing you, to provide employer information to you and to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information as part of Indeed&rsquo;s services. We may also use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities and activities that are detrimental to you or other users. We may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure is (a) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders; (b) helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of Indeed; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public. We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users. We may use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. Indeed may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Indeed's service and to administer Indeed's site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information (such as country of origin). Indeed may maintain (as permitted by applicable law) your data following your termination of your relationship with Indeed. Indeed may delete your user data as permitted by applicable law. If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use those details only for the purpose of processing the payment.  3. Contact and Resume Information Indeed's site may ask you to give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information. You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a 3rd party, through your Indeed account or through other means made available through your contact information such as email, phone, or postal mail. Indeed may also use your contact information to (i) send you job alerts; (ii) create an account; and (iii) send you information about Indeed and promotional material from some of Indeed's partners. Indeed may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on Indeed's site, show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. Your personal information gets placed on the Indeed website when you upload or edit a resume. To the extent you upload a resume or edit it, and subject to your Privacy Settings, Indeed may make the resume and other personal information that you place on your resume available to third parties who may be interested in you as an employee , search engines, or to the general public by posting your personal information on the internet. This may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name. This means that third parties can view the personal information contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility. You may opt-out of this feature by editing your Privacy Settings; however, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public resume information. Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information as part of Indeed&rsquo;s services.  4. Consent Indeed offers any user the choice to utilize the Indeed website. If you create a resume on, upload your resume to or apply to a job through or otherwise use the Indeed website, you are specifically consenting to the use of any personal information you have provided to Indeed as set forth herein and in the Terms of Service.  5. Security Indeed uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between Indeed and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Indeed's control.  6. Cookies &amp;quot;Cookies&amp;quot; are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Indeed's site uses cookies to keep track of your session and advertising delivery. Indeed may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password. Several types of cookies are used on our websites, please see our cookie policy for further information. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use third-party cookies to record information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. By using Indeed, creating or uploading a resume to Indeed or applying to a job through Indeed, you are consenting to such use of Cookies. Most browsers can be set so that you are informed when a Cookie is used and to enable you to refuse Cookies. Please be aware that if you refuse a Cookie it may preclude you from using, or may otherwise restrict the functionality of, the Indeed site or certain areas or features of the site.  7. Links Indeed may create links to other websites. When you click on links on Indeed you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.  8. Amendments Indeed may amend this policy at any time. If Indeed is going to use personally identifiable information collected through Indeed's site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection Indeed will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on Indeed's website for 30 days prior to such use.  9. Assignment If there is a change of ownership or control in Indeed&rsquo;s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or if there is an asset sale, the user information, including your personal information, could be disclosed as part of such a process and / or sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser. However, if that business materially changes this statement or the information-handling practices as described in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified by email and/or through a notice posted on the website, and you may opt-out of the use of your existing information in a new manner. This Privacy Policy inures to the benefit of any successors or assigns of Indeed or the assets of Indeed.  10.

Without limiting the foregoing, under no circumstances shall Indeed or its licensors be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from acts of nature, forces, or causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, Internet failures, computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes, riots, insurrections, civil disturbances, shortages of labor or materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war, governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals, non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat, light, or air conditioning. Claims of Copyright Infringement The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &amp;quot;DMCA&amp;quot;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Indeed Copyright Notice, 177 Broad Street, 6th Floor, Stamford, CT, 06901 (copyright @ indeed.com). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

                       <p>This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the web sites of Indeed (referred to in this policy as &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). &quot;Cookies&quot; are text-only pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive or other web site-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the web site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the &quot;lifetime&quot; of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Like most web sites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your on line experience. Two types of cookies are used on this website: </p>
<p> Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site </p>
<p> Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the site to help customize your Indeed web experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances. Use the options in your web browser if you do not wish to receive a cookie or if you wish to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie folder of your browser. </p>
<p> For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows Explorer: </p>
<ol> 
 <li>Open 'Windows Explorer'</li> 
 <li>Click on the 'Search' button on the tool bar</li> 
 <li>Type &quot;cookie&quot; into the search box for 'Folders and Files'</li> 
 <li>Select 'My Computer' in the 'Look In' box</li> 
 <li>Click 'Search Now'</li> 
 <li>Double click on the folders that are found</li> 
 <li>'Select' any cookie file</li> 
 <li>Hit the 'Delete' button on your keyboard</li> 
</ol>
<p> If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select &quot;cookies&quot; in the &quot;Help&quot; function for information on where to find your cookie folder If you disable all cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of this web site. </p>
<p> Indeed uses the AdWords and Remarketing Lists features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. Indeed and Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to Indeed web sites. This means that vendors including Google will display Indeed promotional material on other sites you visit across the Internet. </p>
<p> You may opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers including AdWords and opt-out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager. To provide web site visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google’s programs. </p>
<p><u>Changes To Our Cookie Policy</u> From time to time, it may be necessary for us to change this cookie policy. We suggest that you check here periodically for any changes. </p>
<p>Indeed Inc. has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of personal data collected about you through the Indeed website. This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 1, 2012. You may contact Indeed at 177 Broad Street, Stamford, CT 06901, USA or via our website contact form. The following discloses Indeed's information gathering, use and dissemination practices for its website. </p>
<p><u>1. Information Collected and Utilized</u> Indeed may collect or receive information about you when you register with the Indeed website or submit information, including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume. Indeed may collect information on the Indeed website pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers. Indeed may also record actions taken on its websites including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. Indeed may store this information on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that it has a relationship with for that purpose. Please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users are not encrypted. We strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. </p>
<p><u>2. Uses of Information</u> Indeed may use the information we collect or receive from you to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience for you and potential employers and for all legal purposes. The purposes for which Indeed uses this information are set forth in Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Privacy Policy. Indeed uses this information, including but not limited to your resume, searches, clicks, applications, messages and postings to provide our services and features to you, to provide your information to employers that may be interested in employing you, to provide employer information to you and to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information as part of Indeed’s services. We may also use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities and activities that are detrimental to you or other users. We may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure is (a) reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders; (b) helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of Indeed; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public. We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users. We may use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. Indeed may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Indeed's service and to administer Indeed's site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information (such as country of origin). Indeed may maintain (as permitted by applicable law) your data following your termination of your relationship with Indeed. Indeed may delete your user data as permitted by applicable law. If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, Indeed will use those details only for the purpose of processing the payment. </p>
<p><u>3. Contact and Resume Information</u> Indeed's site may ask you to give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information. You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a 3rd party, through your Indeed account or through other means made available through your contact information such as email, phone, or postal mail. Indeed may also use your contact information to (i) send you job alerts; (ii) create an account; and (iii) send you information about Indeed and promotional material from some of Indeed's partners. Indeed may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on Indeed's site, show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. Your personal information gets placed on the Indeed website when you upload or edit a resume. To the extent you upload a resume or edit it, and subject to your Privacy Settings, Indeed may make the resume and other personal information that you place on your resume available to third parties who may be interested in you as an employee , search engines, or to the general public by posting your personal information on the internet. This may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name. This means that third parties can view the personal information contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed and for whom Indeed has no responsibility. You may opt-out of this feature by editing your Privacy Settings; however, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public resume information. Indeed reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information as part of Indeed’s services. </p>
<p><u>4. Consent</u> Indeed offers any user the choice to utilize the Indeed website. If you create a resume on, upload your resume to or apply to a job through or otherwise use the Indeed website, you are specifically consenting to the use of any personal information you have provided to Indeed as set forth herein and in the Terms of Service. </p>

<p><u>7. Links</u> Indeed may create links to other websites. When you click on links on Indeed you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements. </p>
<p><u>8. Amendments</u> Indeed may amend this policy at any time.

<p><u>9. Assignment</u> If there is a change of ownership or control in Indeed’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or if there is an asset sale, the user information, including your personal information, could be disclosed as part of such a process and / or sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser.

<p><b>Claims of Copyright Infringement</b></p>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &quot;DMCA&quot;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Indeed Copyright Notice, 177 Broad Street, 6th Floor, Stamford, CT, 06901 (copyright @ indeed.com). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
