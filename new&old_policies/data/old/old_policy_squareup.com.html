<br /><br />
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

<h5 id="cookies">Cookies</h5>

<p>We try to make your experience with Square simple and meaningful. When you access or use the Services, our web server may send a cookie to your device.

  <li>Customize elements of the promotional layout and/or content of our website or application.</li>
  <li>Collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Services (including the length of your web or application session) and the location from which you access the Services, so that we can improve the Services and learn which elements and functions of the Services are most popular with our users.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the cookies used in the Services are set by us, and others are set by third parties who deliver services on our behalf.</p>

<p>Most web and mobile device browsers are set to automatically accept cookies by default. However, you can change your browser settings to prevent automatic acceptance of cookies, or to notify you each time a cookie is set.</p>

<p>You also can learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180106191242/http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>, which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies on different types of browsers and mobile devices.
