            <li><strong>Advertising Campaigns</strong>.   To supplement our Service, we rely on advertisers who wish to serve  advertisements to some or all of our users on our Services and/or other  websites (&ldquo;Campaigns&rdquo;). We may use elements of Your Personal Information to  create a list of users that advertisers may want to direct their Campaigns to.  Advertisers may decide to serve advertisements to all of our users (&ldquo;General  Campaigns&rdquo;), or to send messages to specific segments of our user base (&ldquo;Direct  Campaigns&rdquo;) based on particular personal characteristics (for example, age, sex  or geographic location). In the case of Direct Campaigns, we may use different  elements of Your personal preferences to develop and display advertising  content tailored to Your preferences.  </li>

The  cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data You  voluntarily submitted to us (such as Your email address), that we may share  with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out of  cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please  visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180101222538/http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
        <p><u>Onward  Transfer and Consent to International Processing</u>.  We are a growing corporation with users and  operations in multiple countries, including the European Union. We have  developed data practices designed to assure information is appropriately  protected but we cannot always know where Personal Information may be accessed  or processed. While our primary data centers are in Canada and the United  States, we may transfer Personal Information or other information to Plenty of  Fish offices outside of Canada and the United States. In addition, we may  employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. If  we disclose Personal Information to a third party or to Plenty of Fish  employees outside of Canada and the United States, we will seek assurances that  any information we may provide to them is safeguarded adequately and in  accordance with this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable privacy  laws.</p>
        <p><b><u>If you are visiting from  the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use</u>, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your  personal data, including sensitive data, by us from your region to countries  which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of  protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area, including  the United States. By providing your personal information, you consent to any  transfer and processing in accordance with this Policy.</b></p>
        <p><strong><em>Do Not  Track Browser Signals and Advertising Choices</em></strong></p>
        <p><u>Advertising  Opt-Out</u>.  Some third-party advertising companies with  whom we partner may be advertising networks that are members of the Network  Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad  targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral  advertising practice (www.networkadvertising.org).</p>
        <p><u>Do  Not Track</u>.  At this time, our Service does not recognize  automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include &ldquo;do  not track&rdquo; instructions. However, you may be able to change your privacy  preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your  browser, as described above.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Third-Party  Websites</em></strong></p>
        <p>Our  Service may contain links to other websites or Internet resources which are  provided solely for Your convenience and information.

We have no  responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or  Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of Your Personal  Information. We encourage You to read the privacy policies of those other  websites to learn how they collect and use Your Personal Information. </p>
        <p><strong><em>How Do I  Access or Correct my Personal Information?</em></strong></p>
        <p>Applicable  privacy laws may allow any individual the right to access and/or request the  correction of errors or omissions in his or her Personal Information that is in  our custody or under our control. Our Privacy Officer will assist the  individual with the access request. This includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>identification  of Personal Information under our custody or control; and</li>
            <li>information  about how Personal Information under our control may be or has been used by us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We  will respond to requests within the time allowed by applicable privacy laws and  will make every effort to respond as accurately and completely as possible. Any  corrections made to Personal Information will be promptly sent to any  organization it was disclosed to. </p>
        <p>In  certain exceptional circumstances, we may not be able to provide access to  certain Personal Information it holds about an individual. For security  purposes, not all Personal Information is accessible and amendable by the  Privacy Officer. If access or corrections cannot be provided, we will notify  the individual making the request within 30 days, in writing, of the reasons  for the refusal. </p>
        <p><strong><em>How Long  Do We Keep Your Data?</em></strong></p>
        <p>We  keep Your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business  purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements. In Canada, Personal  Information used to make a decision that directly affects an individual will be  kept for at least one year after such a decision. We have retention standards  that meet these parameters. </p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>How Do You  Choose What Information We Collect and Use?</em></strong><br>
            <br>

        <p><u>Turning  Off Notifications</u>.  Should You no longer wish to receive  notifications from the Service when You receive a message from another Service  user or when another user adds You as a favorite, You may turn these  notifications off through Mail Settings (http://www.pof.com/mailsettings.aspx).  The Service will not send You notifications after Your account is deleted.</p>
        <p><strong><em>How Do We  Protect Your Personal Information?</em></strong></p>
        <p>The  Service limits access to your personal information. We have physical,  electronic, and administrative procedures in place to protect and help prevent  unauthorized access and use of personal information.</p>
        <p>No  data transmissions through the Internet or via mobile devices, or even the  physical transfer of information, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We  cannot fully eliminate all security risks associated with personal information.  We do not ensure or warrant the security of any data or information you transmit  to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p>You  agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security,  privacy, and administrative issues, such as security breaches. We may post a  notice on our Service if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to  you at the email address you have provided to us. </p>
        <p><strong><em>Children&rsquo;s  Privacy</em></strong></p>
        <p>Although  our Service is a general audience website, we restrict the use of our service  to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information  from children under the age of 13.</p>
