</ol>

<h3 id="s4">4) HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any Personal Information we process about you. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind firewalls. Any payment transactions and credit or debit card data will be encrypted.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that:</p>

<ol class="lower_letters">
  <li>there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control;</li>
  <li>the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and</li>
  <li>any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</li>
</ol>

<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone and keep your account information secure. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site like message boards.</p>

<p>In the event that Personal Information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, ZipRecruiter will notify those persons whose Personal Information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<h3 id="s5">5) MESSAGING SERVICE <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

<p>We collect, process and store information when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our Services. This includes information such as the number of messages you’ve sent and received, when you have viewed a message, details of who you’ve chatted with and when and which messages were responded to (<b>"Message Data"</b>). We may share limited portions of Message Data with third parties including other users of our Services, such as identifying active users of the message service, highlighting responsiveness to messages, or notifying a sender when a message has been viewed.</p>

<p>We also store your messages (<b>"Message Content"</b>) to generally permit you to access your message history; however, we cannot guarantee access to all messages at all times, and messages may be removed or deleted, including in connection with changes in or interruptions of service with our vendors, changes to our Services or features, or ZipRecruiter’s or our vendors’ data retention processes or storage limitations.  We may view Message Content to investigate or resolve technical or trust and safety issues or to improve our Services.  We will never share Message Content with third parties except as required by law or with your consent.</p>

<p>We also may use automatic scanning technology on messages to allow us to recognize patterns on our messaging platform. These patterns may help us make your professional communications more efficient and informed and contribute to a safer and more secure job search experience. For example, our software may do the following:</p>

<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Look for text that indicates a web link (e.g. ends with ".com" or similar) to generate a clickable link</li>
  <li>Provide auto-complete options when it anticipates who the receiver of the message may be</li>
  <li>Look for content to provide <i>quick actions</i> such as a scheduling tool</li>
  <li>Look for content to provide <i>quick replies</i> based on context</li>
  <li>Check links shared in messages for malicious sites and looks for blacklisted keywords to detect spam and fraud.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s6">6)  PUBLIC FORUMS <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

<p>You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose any Personal Information in a public forum on the Site, this information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Privacy Policy does not apply to such information. You accept that you, and not ZipRecruiter, are responsible for providing such information in any public forum. Any submissions to public areas on the Site are accepted by you with the understanding that such forums are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your comments or any content to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make any submissions. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>

<h3 id="s7">7) COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

<ol class="alpha">
  <li><b>Tracking Technologies.</b> ZipRecruiter and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

  </li>
  <li><b>Clear Gifs Information.</b> When you use our Services, ZipRecruiter or our third party analytics providers may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users and help us better manage content on our Site by informing us of what content is effective. No personally identifiable information from your ZipRecruiter account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make our Services better for our users.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</li>

  <li><b>Tracking across Third Party Websites.</b> Some third party websites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, certain website browsers allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. The Services does not respond to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals on your browser. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</li>
  <li><b>Mobile Analytics. </b>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.
