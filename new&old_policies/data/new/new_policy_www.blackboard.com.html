Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

Introduction
    </h2>
    <p><strong>We care about privacy.</strong> We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart. You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our <a title="Click to reach our Privacy Center." target="_self" href="/web/20180607131253/http://www.blackboard.com/legal/privacy-center.html"><strong>Privacy Center</strong></a>.</p><p>Our business model is different from that of companies that collect your personal information to monetize such data. We collect and use personal information to allow us to provide our products and services to our clients and end users. In most cases, we do this at the direction of our clients. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition. See <a href="#section-12" title="Click to Section 4 to read more about personal information disclosure." target="_self"><strong>Vendors, Partners &amp; Other Types of Disclosures</strong></a> for more details on how we may disclose personal information in the context of changes to our business structure.</p><p>We are EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certified, a proud signatory of the Privacy Pledge, and a member of the Future of Privacy Forum.</p>

This analysis is necessary to further our legitimate interest in understanding our users and how they interact with us and our websites, improving our websites and communication with you (including for marketing purposes).</p><p><strong>Personalization.</strong> For some of our websites we also use your information to personalize the pages, which is necessary to provide more contextually relevant information as you browse our websites. For example, if you have indicated your primary industry or your job title, we may present content related to your role or industry as your browse our websites and return to them.</p><p><strong>Communication.</strong> If you use Behind the Blackboard, Blackboard Community, or other websites with logins, we use the contact details you provided to communicate with you and to let you communicate with us and other Blackboard users.

If your institution has enabled Cloud Profiles or Social Profiles, you can also connect your Blackboard profile with your Facebook and Twitter account and use information from those accounts for your Blackboard profile. The data we receive is dependent upon the social media service and your privacy settings with the social media service.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Social media posts.</span> Our Social Media Manager product allows institutions to collect public social media posts and comments with matching keywords and hashtags to give an institution visibility into social conversations taking place about them.

Vendors, Partners &amp; Other Types of Disclosures
    </h2>
    <p><p>This section provides more information on how we protect your information when we engage vendors, how we share information with our partners, and in which other scenarios we may share your information with third parties.</p><p><strong>Vendors</strong><br/>
We use vendors to help us provide our products and services to our clients and you or to perform work on our behalf. Where this requires access to personal information, we are responsible for the data privacy practices of the vendors. Our vendors must abide by our strict data privacy and security requirements and instructions. They are not allowed to use personal information they access or receive from us for any other purposes than as needed to carry out their work for us.</p><p><strong>Partners</strong><br/>
In some countries and regions, our products and services are offered through channel (or reselling) partners (<a title="Review our list of Channel Partners." target="_self" href="/web/20180607131253/http://www.blackboard.com/about-us/locations/find-a-channel-partner.html"><strong>see the list of our channel partners</strong></a>).We will share information with them that is necessary for them to offer and provide our products and services to our current and prospective clients.</p><p>Some of our products allow you to access functionalities or content provided by our content and technology partners. For example, Blackboard Learn’s integration with Dropbox Education allows institutions and users to store and share content using Dropbox functionalities. With your or your institution’s permission, we will share information about you, such as your name, email, or student ID, that is required for you to access these partner functionalities or content from our products and services.</p><p><strong>Other types of disclosures</strong><br/>
We will also share your information where required in the following circumstances.</p><ul><li><strong>Payments.</strong> Where you use our products and services to make a purchase or transaction, we will share your payment and transaction data with banks and other organizations to process the transactions and for fraud detection and prevention or anti-money laundering purposes.</li><li><strong>Changes to our business structure.</strong> Where permitted by applicable law and by the contracts with our clients, we may disclose your information in the following cases: 
<br/><ul><li>Corporate transactions such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, and financing </li><li>Bankruptcy, dissolution or reorganization, or in similar transactions or proceedings </li><li>Steps related to the previous bullet points (for example, due diligence)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Comply with law.</strong> We may need to disclose your information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests, court orders, and legal processes. We will always aim to limit the information we provide as much as possible. Where such disclosures relate to personal information we hold on behalf of our clients, we will defer such requests to our clients where permissible.</li><li><strong>Enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety.</strong> We may need to disclose your information to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of us, our clients, or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud.</li><li><strong>De-identified information.</strong> We may disclose aggregate or de-identified information that is no longer associated with an identifiable individual for research or to enhance and promote our products and services. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified information with our partners or others for business or research purposes like partnering with a research firm or academics to explore how our products are being used and how such data can be used to enhance our functionalities and further help our clients and other educational institutions. We will implement appropriate safeguards before sharing information, which may include removing or hashing direct identifiers (e.g., your name, email address, and device ID).</li></ul></p>
