<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong></p>
<p>Taking proper precautions helps to make sure your personal and financial information &mdash; as well as your identity &mdash; remains safe.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a strong, unique password for each of your accounts. Memorize them and use multi-factor authentication where available. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607211257/https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/privacy-security/understanding-password-security" target="_self">Learn more about creating strong passwords</a></li>
<li>Only download software or applications from well-known or reputable sources, such as Apple, Google Play or Microsoft. Check the logos, developer names and reviews to spot fake applications. Scammers count on users being too busy to see differences that can make fake software easier to spot.</li>
<li>Install any operating system and software updates (sometimes called patches or service packs)</li>
<li>Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth services when you're not using them, and avoid using public Wi-Fi for financial transactions unless you use a secure, private connection, like VPN software.</li>
<li>Back up your data regularly. If you use online or cloud storage, be sure you understand your provider's privacy and security policies and keep your access codes safe.</li>
<li>Use the administrator log in on your home computer only for creating new users and installing software. If you use administrator accounts when browsing the internet, banking or reading email, the risk of malicious code entering your computer without detection is much greater. Create standard user accounts for yourself and everyone in your family to limit your exposure.</li>

									<h3>Advertising Practices</h3>
										<p>We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.</p>
<p>If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may <a onclick="$('.ui-dialog').remove();" name="WebsiteAdPractices_OptOut" href="/web/20180607211257/https://www.bankofamerica.com/privacy/online-privacy-notice.go#advertising-on-our-sites" target="_blank">opt out of online behavioral advertising</a>. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.</p>
<p>Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.</p>
