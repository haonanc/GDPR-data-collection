        </p>
        <p>Thank you for using Airfarewatchdog.com website or mobile properties, including related applications (collectively, the "Site"), which are provided by Smarter Travel Media LLC  ("Airfarewatchdog").</p>

Our Site is is owned and operated by Smarter Travel LLC ("Smarter Travel").  More details about Airfarewatchdog can be found below under "How you can contact us."</p>
        <p>We understand that providing information online involves a great deal of trust on your part.  We take this trust very seriously and make it a high priority to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal information you provide to us when you visit our Site or use our services.  Before submitting your personal information to us, please read this Policy carefully to learn about our privacy practices. By visiting Airfarewatchdog's site, www.Airfarewatchdog.com, or using a mobile phone, tablet, or similar device (a "Device") or in connection with other sites or services, you are accepting the practices described herein.</p>
        <p><strong>What information we collect from you</strong></p>
        <span class="span_underline">In General.</span><br> </br>
        <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Site or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, user name and password, and billing information (such as your credit card number, cardholder name, and card expiration date).  We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options.  You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from Smarter Travel and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member.  For example, only registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, e-mail Airfarewatchdog content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes.  In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.</p>
        <span class="span_underline">Information from Other Sources.</span><br> </br>
        <p>We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you.  For example, if you visit Airfarewatchdog by "clicking-through" from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third-party services, such as social media services, through our Site or before coming to our Site, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our Site in accordance with the practices outlined in this section and Policy.</p>
        <span class="span_underline">Automatic Information.</span><br> </br>
        <p>We automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit Airfarewatchdog.  For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring Web site.  We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made.  One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience.</p>
        <span class="span_underline" id="cookies">Cookies and Other Web Technologies.</span><br> </br>
        <p>Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive or your Device (if your Web browser permits).  Airfarewatchdog and its affiliated websites and Apps use cookies for the following general purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site.  For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit.  We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in."  Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.</li>
            <li>To help us customize the content, website experience, and advertisements provided to you on our Site and Apps and on other Web sites across the Internet.  For example, when you access a Web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.  See <a href="#display_of_advertising">Display of Advertising/Your Choices</a> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>
            <li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which e-mails you open and act upon).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Site participates in exchanges of anonymous information about user browsing behavior on the Site. This non-personally identifiable information is collected by cookies and other similar technologies and segmented into different anonymized groups. We may share these types of anonymous information with third parties to facilitate the display of targeted advertisements. Please click
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604130811/http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/">here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604130811/http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/">here</a>
            to learn more about these types of exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies and your options with regard to participation in these programs (including opting-out).</p>
        <p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies.  Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.</p>
        <p>Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page.  We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Web site, and to improve site performance.  We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site.  This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>
        <span class="span_underline" id="display_of_advertising">Display of Advertising/Your Choices</span><br> </br>
        <p><i>Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising</i></p>
        <p>Airfarewatchdog and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites.  To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches and other site activities, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests.  So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on Airfarewatchdog.com, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on Airfarewatchdog.com or on another website you visit.</p>
        <p>We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.  You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other Web sites, based on your travel-related searches on Airfarewatchdog.com by clicking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604130811/http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here.</a></p>
        <p><i>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</i></p>
        <p>Many of the advertisements you see on the Smarter Travel family of sites are served by TripAdvisor or its service providers.  But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through <a href="#cookies">cookies and other technologies</a>.  These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different Web sites on the Internet.  The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p>
        <p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.  Some of these companies are members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604130811/http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.  To learn more, please click <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604130811/http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">here</a>.</p>
        <p><i>Response to Do Not Track signals</i></p>
        <p>Your Web browser may transmit a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal to Airfarewatchdog and other websites. Because of differences in Web browsers' default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. Airfarewatchdog does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and Airfarewatchdog recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.</p>
        <p><strong>How we use your information</strong></p>
        <p>Airfarewatchdog uses the information we collect about you for the following general purposes: for registration and to manage your account, including to allow your access to and use of our site; to communicate with you in general, including to provide information about Airfarewatchdog and invitations from the Airfarewatchdog community; to enable us to publish your reviews, forum posts, and other content to the Airfarewatchdog community; to facilitate your booking of travel reservations; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Site; to notify you about special offers and products or services available from us or our partners that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with Airfarewatchdog, including customizing the ads shown to you; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</p>
        <p>If you have signed up as the owner or manager of a vacation rental, or listed your vacation rental property in our Destination Resources section, we will send you e-mail messages at the email address you provide to us.</p>
        <p>Please review "<a href="#your_choices">Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information</a>" below.</p>

        <p>Airfarewatchdog may share your information with the following entities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="span_underline">Suppliers,</span> including but not limited to hotel, airline, cruise, car rental, or activity providers, or vacation rental managers or owners who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout Airfarewatchdog and its affiliated sites, all products and services provided by third-party suppliers are described as such. Information that we share with suppliers to facilitate reservations will be treated according to applicable suppliers' privacy policies, except for payment information. We share payment information only when it is necessary for travel reservations facilitated through or made on Airfarewatchdog, and we restrict suppliers' use of payment information for these purposes. We encourage you to review the privacy policies, terms of use, and other policies of any travel supplier whose products and services you may purchase through Airfarewatchdog. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or your travel plans, to facilitate your travel reservations, or for other purposes consistent with the practices described in their privacy policies and terms of use.</li>
            <li><span class="span_underline">Third-party vendors</span> who provide services or functions on our behalf, including business analytics, payment processing, customer service, marketing, public relations, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention.

            <li><span class="span_underline">Business partners</span> with whom we may offer products or services in conjunction.  You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear either with ours or separately. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners.  Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.</li>
            <li><span class="span_underline">Referring Web sites</span>.  If you were referred to Airfarewatchdog from another Web site, we may share your registration information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and travel preferences, about you with that referring Web site.  We have not placed limitations on the referring Web sites' use of personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Web site that referred you to Airfarewatchdog.</li>
            <li><span class="span_underline">Social Media Services</span>. You can choose to access certain third party social media websites and services through our site (such as Facebook).

We may share your personal information within the Smarter Travel Media Group as well as with our parent companies and domestic and international corporate affiliate companies and websites. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you.  To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial e-mail they send to choose not to receive such e-mail messages in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also may share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law.

            <li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of Airfarewatchdog, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.</li>

You will have the ability to view your profile as members of the public will see it.  Additionally, if you choose to participate in our member-to-member communications programs, other Airfarewatchdog members may contact you by using Airfarewatchdog as an intermediary; however, Airfarewatchdog will not share your email address with any other members nor display it any public manner.  All Airfarewatchdog members have the option to turn off the member-to-member communication features at any time.</p>
        <p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.</p>
        <p>We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.  For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our Site receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations.  This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>
        <p><strong>How you can access your information</strong></p>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, and complete. You can access and update your contact information by visiting the Newsletters page on the Site.  You can close your Airfarewatchdog account by contacting us at the phone number listed below or by selecting "Unsubscribe Me" on the Newsletters page.  Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal information.  However, you can open a new account at any time.  Please also note that we may retain certain information associated with your account in our archives, including for analytical purposes as well as for recordkeeping integrity.</p>
        <p id="your_choices"><strong>Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any information, although it may be needed to take advantage of certain features offered on Airfarewatchdog.</li>
            <li>You also can add or update information and close your account as described above. If you decide to close your Airfarewatchdog account, we will deactivate your account and remove your profile information from active view. Please note, however, that we may retain in our files some information associated with your account and past transactions for purposes including backups, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, investigations, and compliance with legal requirements.</li>
            <li>As a registered Airfarewatchdog member, you can modify your e-mail subscription choices at any time on the Member Profile page.  Whether registered as a Airfarewatchdog member or not, you also will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from promotional messages in any such e-mail we send.  Please note that we reserve the right to send you other communications, including service announcements, administrative messages, and surveys relating either to your Airfarewatchdog account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</li>
            <li>Email Communications. Airfarewatchdog wants to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Site.  One way we do this is by sending you e-mail messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests.  For example, if you search for a flight to New York, or New York hotels or reviews on Airfarewatchdog.com, we may send you an email message reminding you about special airfare or hotel offers in New York.  Similarly, if you receive an email about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels, flights, or local travel reviews by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel or flight offers.  We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites.  Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.</li>
            <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from Airfarewatchdog, you will not be able to access portions of our site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How we protect your information</strong></p>
        <p>We want you to feel confident about using Airfarewatchdog, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect.  While no Web site can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us.  For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions.  In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your personal information between your system and ours, and between our systems and those of the parties with whom we share sensitive information, we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.</p>

        <p><strong>External links</strong></p>
        <p>If any part of the Airfarewatchdog Site links you to other Web sites, those external Web sites do not operate under this Privacy Policy.
