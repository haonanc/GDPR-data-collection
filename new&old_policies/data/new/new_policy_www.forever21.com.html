We receive and store information you enter on our Websites, provide to us at our stores, or give to us in any other way. For example, you may provide information to us when you make an in-store purchase, register with our Websites, sign-in, search or add items to your shopping cart, purchase an item, participate in a survey, contest or promotion, apply for a job, request to receive our marketing materials, or communicate with Forever 21's customer service.

                <p class="t_bold">ARBITRATION</p>
                <p class="pb_10">Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Forever 21's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); or (2) violations of  the “Content Submission” provision above, ("<strong>Excluded Disputes</strong>"), you agree that all disputes between you and Forever 21 (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Forever 21, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Site, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Forever 21 hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules, and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Forever 21 will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Forever 21 is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Forever 21 or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>

                <p class="pb_20">If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Forever 21's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Forever 21 reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment.

                <p class="pb_20">Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to your or Forever 21's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents) (“Excluded Disputes”), you agree that all disputes between you and Forever 21 (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Forever 21, including without limitation disputes related to this Returns and Exchanges Policy, your use of the Site, purchase of products, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Forever 21 hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor Forever 21 will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Forever 21 is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Forever 21 or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with this Returns and Exchanges Policy, or the website <a href="/web/20180603180611/https://www.forever21.com/us/shop/info/terms"><span class="underline">Terms of Use</span>.</a></p>
                <p>YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. If you do so, neither you nor Forever 21 can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Forever 21 in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out: </p>

                <p class="pb_20">If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Forever 21. </p>

                <p class="t_bold">GOVERNING LAW &#38; VENUE</p>
                <p class="pb_20">For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of this Returns and Exchanges Policy, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with Forever 21 exclusively in a state or federal court located in Los Angeles, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Los Angeles County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
                <p class="pb_20">If any provision of these Returns and Exchanges Policy is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from this Returns and Exchanges Policy and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Forever 21's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Returns and Exchanges Policy will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of this Returns and Exchanges Policy will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. Forever 21 reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with Forever 21. </p>
