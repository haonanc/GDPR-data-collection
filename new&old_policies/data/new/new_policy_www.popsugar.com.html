<h1 class="highlight-blue border-box">2. HOW WE COLLECT OR RECEIVE INFORMATION</h1>
<p>We collect User Information across our Services, including as follows:</p>
<li>When you register for our Services (for example, name, username, password, country or state of location, zip code, postal mail address and email address);</li>
<li>If you sign up for an email subscription on our Services, we collect your email address and may also collect other information about your subscription preferences and interests;</li>
<li>For some of our Services, you may be asked to provide your mobile phone number in order to receive text messages containing information you have requested and other information that we think may be of interest to you;</li>
<li>When you view or interact with our Services, we may collect certain data, including IP Address, language setting, operating system type, page you requested, Advertising ID, user agent, and time stamp;</li>
<li>When you use the Services, we collect information about your search and click activity;</li>
<li>We may collect or receive information about you when you sign up for a sweepstakes, contest or other giveaway or promotion (<b>"Promotions"</b>) offered by us or our partners;</li>
<li>We may collect your user-generated content (for example, photos that you take or upload, comments that you provide or workout routines that you create, or URL links);</li>
<li>When you make a purchase through our Services, we or our vendors may also collect your information as set forth below under <a href="#section4">WHAT INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES</a>;</li>
<li>When you send an email to us, we will receive your email address and other information associated with your request;</li>
<li>Your Personal Information may be provided by other users of the Services (for example, when another user gives you a gift subscription of our "Must Have" box Service and provides your email in connection with the gift);</li>
<li>If you use a third party connection or log-in (such as Facebook Connect or Google) in connection with the Services, we may receive your name, email address and/or profile photo for those third party services or other information available about you or collected from you on those services; and</li>
<li>We may also supplement the User Information we collect from you with information from third parties, including third party vendors, affiliate network operators, referral sources, social networking sites or services (such as Facebook), and publicly-available sources.</li>
<h3 class="highlight-blue">Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>Some of the User Information is collected on the Services through the use of Cookies and/or Web Beacons. <b>"Cookies"</b> are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your computer or mobile web browser that allow us, and third parties with whom we partner, to recognize your browser or mobile device and transfer information about you and your use of our Services. For example, Cookies that we use tell us how many times you have visited one of our websites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement that has been displayed to you. We use "persistent" Cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Services. We also use "session ID" Cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session ID Cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from a Service and close your browser.</p>
<p>We (and third parties with whom we partner) may also deliver a file known as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag (i.e., <b>"Web Beacons"</b>) to you through our Services. Web Beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Services interface or in emails relating to the Services to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Services interface, such as to count visits, access Cookies, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon. <b>"Pixels"</b> or <b>"Pixel Tags"</b> also known as clear GIFs, beacons, spotlight, tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the user's computer to a third party website. We (and third parties with whom we partner) may deliver Web Beacons or Pixel Tags to you through our Services. Web Beacons allow ad networks, marketing partners and other service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, for advertisers and our other partners. Web Beacons also enable ad networks and other partners to track your behavior for their own analysis and use, and to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites or platforms. These Web Beacons enable third party companies to view, edit, or set their own Cookies when you visit the Services, just as if you had visited a web page from their site.</p>
<p><a name="section3"></a><br/>

<p>When you receive email messages or newsletters from us, we may use Web Beacons, customized links, clear GIFs or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information, and/or aggregate such data with other data we collect for some or all of the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We and our partners use Cookies and other tracking technologies to administer the Services, analyze trends, track users' movements around the Services and on third party sites, devices and applications, and to gather demographic information about our user base.</p>

<p><a name="section4"></a><br/>
<h1 class="highlight-blue border-box">4. WHAT INFORMATION WE SHARE WITH THIRD PARTIES</h1>
<h3 class="highlight-blue">Advertising and marketing</h3>
<p>Certain third party vendors and partners authorized by POPSUGAR (including, but not limited to, advertisers, advertising agencies, ad networks, ad measurement providers, and other marketing and advertising service providers and partners) (<b>"Advertisers"</b>) may collect information about you on the Services in order to provide you with relevant advertising on the Services and on other websites, platforms and media channels, and to analyze the performance of advertising campaigns. These Advertisers may use tracking technologies such as Cookies, Web Beacons, and other similar technologies, and may collect many different kinds of data, such as your IP Address, Device ID, Advertising ID and Precise Location Data where made available by your mobile device. The specific Advertisers we work with are subject to change at any time. For a list of some of the applicable providers or for more details on opting out of tracking for advertising purposes, go to our Cookie Consent Tool by clicking on the button in the lower right corner of your screen labeled <b>"Cookie Consent"</b>. <b>The use of tracking technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.</b></span></p>
<p>To opt out of collection of your information by Nielsen, or to obtain information about the technologies they use or their own privacy policies, please visit the Nielsen consumer opt out page located <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607202627/http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy#choice" onclick="trackOutboundLink('article:page', 'www.nielsen.com', '44868672', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20180607202627/http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy#choice')" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We may also sell or transfer Interaction Data to certain Advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests. Some of these third parties may combine the Interaction Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture. We may also share your information with Advertisers for the purpose of allowing them or their clients to send you marketing communications related to your use of the Services, their services or programs featured and/or advertised on the Services (e.g., through ads or Promotions), or their products, services and/or programs generally.</p>
<p>Our third party vendors and partners use your User Information to display ads on both the Services and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively, <b>"Channels"</b>). For example, if you read content about a particular subject on the Services, we may use Cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed content. These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.</p>
<p>Some of our Services may use Facebook and Instagram features and tools, including Pixel Tags, which send data regarding your use of the Services to Facebook and/or Instagram for the purpose of tracking your interaction with the Services and with our brand on Facebook and Instagram, and to create custom audiences on the Facebook and/or Instagram platforms. Facebook and Instagram link the data collected on our Services with your account on their platforms and we and/or our Advertisers may use that data to serve you with advertisements both on and off of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>We may provide certain Advertisers with information regarding your interactions with our emails and newsletters or as to whether your information matches certain information held by the Advertiser and/or their customers. Those Advertisers may combine this data with information they collect for their own marketing purposes and in turn, may provide this information to their customers for their customers' marketing purposes.</p>
<p>In order to help us sell advertising on the Services and otherwise publicize POPSUGAR and its products and services, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience. Those statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the Services and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.</p>
<h3 class="highlight-blue">Third party service providers</h3>
<p>We employ or utilize the services of other third party vendors, consultants and service providers who need access to your User Information (such as your name, address, email, or other identifiers) in order to enable them to perform services on our behalf or to provide us with additional information necessary to provide you one of our Services to you. We use third party vendors for a variety of services across our Services, such as email message deployment, email address validation, subscription fulfillment, research, statistical analysis, cross-device user tracking, data and website hosting, marketing, advertising, and other data and transaction processing. </p>
<p>We also engage third party service providers for the purpose of processing payments for subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional mailings, and to monitor, analyze and prevent fraudulent traffic or other suspicious activities on our Services or on other services. For our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607202627/https://www.popsugar.com/voices">Voices</a> and Influencer platforms, we may also provide your User Information to third party processors in order to process payments for services if you are selected for a paid assignment under those platforms.</p>
<p>In addition to receiving your User Information from us, our service providers may also: </p>
<li>Collect information directly from you and/or your device, such as your IP Address, Device ID, Advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system;</li>
<li>Combine User Information about you received from POPSUGAR with information about you from other sites or services; and/or</li>
<li>Place or recognize a unique Cookie or other tracking mechanism on your browser.</li>
<h3 class="highlight-blue">Third party partners and websites</h3>
<p>Our third party partners may sell items or provide services to you through our Services (either alone or jointly with us). In some of these cases, you will be routed through to the third party's website, where you will complete the purchase. When you make a purchase or activate the partner's service (for example, through our POPSUGAR Must Have Service) we may share your Personal Information, such as an email address, with that partner, who may use this Personal Information in accordance with its own privacy policy. Please note that we are not responsible for any applicable third party terms or policies and you should review them carefully.</p>

<p>You may add, update or delete information through your user account settings, which limits the ability of other users to see the information in your user profile. The information you can view, update, or delete may be different depending on which area of the Services you are using and may also change as the Services change.</p>
