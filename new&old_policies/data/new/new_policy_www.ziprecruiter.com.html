  <p><strong><u>Personal Data</u></strong></p>

  <p>We may share Personal Data with the following parties:</p>

  <p><strong><u>Internal Parties</u></strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Companies within our corporate family that comprise the ZipRecruiter Group.&nbsp; Access to your Personal Data will be controlled and only granted where necessary to provide our services to you and/or to allow us to perform any necessary or legitimate functions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><u>External Third-Parties</u></strong></p>

  <ul class="bullets">
    <li>Service providers that we use to support our business and help provide our services to you, including, but not limited to, third-parties that host our Website, assist us to verify your identity, perform website and platform maintenance, risk assessments, and security, perform data and web analytics, provide databases, IT services, customer service, payment platforms and credit card processing, communication services, and email services</li>
    <li>We require all third-parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your Personal Data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions</li>
    <li>Professional advisers such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, financial, auditing, and accounting services to us so we can operate our business</li>
    <li>Taxing authorities, such as the Internal Revenue Service and other authorities acting as processors based in the United States, the United Kingdom and other applicable countries, who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances</li>
    <li>Fraud prevention and identity verification services where we believe that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipRecruiter, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with third-parties for the purposes of fraud detection and prevention, and credit risk reduction</li>
    <li>In connection with or during negotiations of any proposed or actual financing, merger, purchase, sale, sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or stock, joint venture, or any other type of financing, acquisition or business combination of our company(ies), or all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company, including without limitation in the event of a&nbsp; divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other event, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding.&nbsp; In the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets or stock, Personal Data that we hold about our clients and users of our services will be one of the assets that will be transferred.&nbsp; If a change happens to our business, the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy</li>
    <li>Third-parties where you have expressly consented to the disclosure of your Personal Data</li>
    <li>Law enforcement agencies, courts, supervisory authorities, regulatory bodies and certain other third-parties, to the extent that we are permitted or required to do so by law, or in order to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, or in the interests of national security, or to respond to verified requests relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity</li>
    <li>To enforce our&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180604013952/https://www.ziprecruiter.com/terms">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and other agreements with you, to respond to, and defend ourselves against, claims asserted against us, to protect the rights, property, or safety of ZipRecruiter, our services, customers or others, or to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities</li>
    <li>With prospective employers if you respond to a job advertisement or have opted-in to our Resume Database.&nbsp;<u>Note:</u>&nbsp;to the extent that you have an account with ZipRecruiter, please ensure that the resume associated with your account is up-to-date so when you apply for a job on a ZipRecruiter website, the employer receives your most recent resume. You will have an account with ZipRecruiter if you opened an account yourself, signed up for job alerts, submitted your resume to the resume database, and/or applied for a job on the ZipRecruiter website. You can delete and upload new resumes by going to the &lsquo;Profile&rsquo; settings in your account</li>
    <li>Upon your authorization, the Services may also post information directly to the timeline of your Connected Site Account</li>
    <li>With prospective employers or recruiters if you add your resume to the Resume Database. Users of the Services may also be able to view a free preview of information in the Resume Database that contains certain job/education history and other information. You can opt-out of your information being available in our Resume Database at any time by updating this preference on the My Profile tab of your Job Seeker account.</li>
    <li>With prospective employers and recruiters (and/or with their external Applicant Tracking System or similar external system used by such companies to manage responses to their job postings), if you respond to a job posting</li>
    <li>From time to time, we may run contests, special offers, or other events or activities (&quot;<em>Events</em>&quot;) on our Services together with a third-party partner. If you provide information to such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties&#39; use of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events</li>
    <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information or with your consent</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong><u>Non-Personal Data</u></strong></p>

  <p>Where permitted by applicable law, we may share your Non-Personal Data for any purpose not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or any written representation we have made to you at the point and time of the data collection.</p>

  <h3 id="s7">7) WHERE YOUR DATA IS TRANSFERRED <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

  <p>We transfer Non-Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws.  We share your Personal Data within the ZipRecruiter Group as permitted by applicable law.  This means that the Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, accessed in, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area.    In such event, we ensure your Personal Data is protected by requiring companies within the ZipRecruiter Group to follow the same rules when processing your Personal Data. These rules are called "binding corporate rules".  Many of our external third-parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>

  <h3 id="s8">8) HOW LONG YOUR DATA WILL BE KEPT <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

  <p>We will not retain your Personal Data for longer than necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.  Different retention periods apply for different types of Personal Data and in determining the appropriate retention period, we consider several criteria, including, but not limited to, the purpose for which we hold your Personal Data, our legal, accounting, reporting and/or regulatory obligations in relation to that Personal Data, e.g., financial or tax reporting obligations, whether our relationship with you is ongoing, e.g., where you use more than one of our products and/or services, any specific request you may have made in relation to the deletion of your Personal Data, or where we have a legitimate interest in relation to the management of our own rights, e.g., the defence of any claims.  In some circumstances we may anonymize your Personal Data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you no longer have a relationship with us, we will retain and securely destroy your Personal Data subject to the foregoing and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  If you request to receive no further contact from us, we will keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.</p>

  <h3 id="s9">9) YOUR DATA SUBJECT ACCESS RIGHTS (for data subjects in the EEA) <a href="#top" class="topLink">top</a></h3>

  <p><strong><u>Method for Requesting Information Pursuant to Your Rights</u></strong></p>

  <p>Upon request, ZipRecruiter will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you would like to exercise any of the data subject access rights in the table above (each, an “<u>Access Request</u>”) please send an email to <a href="dsars@ziprecruiter.com">dsars@ziprecruiter.com</a>, and we will send you a Data Subject Access Request Form. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

  <p><strong><u>No Fee Usually Required</u></strong></p>

  <p>You will not usually be required to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of the other rights).&nbsp; However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

  <p><strong><u>What We May Need from You</u></strong></p>

  <p>Once we receive your Access Request, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal Data (or to exercise any of your other rights).&nbsp; This is a security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

  <p><strong><u>Time Limit to Respond</u></strong></p>

  <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.&nbsp; Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
