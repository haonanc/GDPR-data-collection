That penalty was assessed following <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/business\/wp\/2018\/04\/16\/u-s-companies-banned-from-selling-to-chinas-zte-telecom-maker\/?utm_term=.aa0d1f82bf27\">an investigation showing that ZTE had violated U.S. sanctions<\/a> by selling telecom technology to Iran and North Korea. Ross made the comments on CNBC\u2019s morning show Squawk Box.<\/p>\n<p>This was an incredible scare for ZTE. As part of the original settlement with the U.S. government last year, ZTE had agreed to accept a $1.19 billion fine and made personnel changes to satisfy U.S. regulators. The Trump administration then took that penalty even further, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/16\/u-s-companies-banned-from-selling-components-to-zte\/\">banning U.S. companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years<\/a>, components critical to ZTE\u2019s entire product line. That decision was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/05\/09\/technology\/zte-china-us-trade-war.html\">expected to kill the company<\/a>, which employs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/companies\/zte\/\">roughly 75,000 workers<\/a> and had been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/4cabb00a-53fb-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec\">worth about $20 billion<\/a> before the ban.<\/p>\n<p>While the ban seemed to be the end of the company, President Donald Trump <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/13\/trump-zte\/\">seemed to offer it something of a reprieve<\/a> on May 13, when he tweeted that he would instruct the Commerce Department to try to work out a deal that would offer \u201ca way to get back into business, fast.\u201d While the president is known for mercurial decision-making, the turnabout deeply surprised DC insiders, with many national security officials vociferously opposed to any deal to resuscitate the company.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to a $1 billion fine, the company has made several personnel changes, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/tech\/article\/2149089\/zte-senior-sales-executive-replaced-communist-party-secretary-amid-shake\">rotating out the company\u2019s Communist Party leader<\/a>. The company is also believed to have agreed to a $400 million escrow that would be used to pay for future penalties.\u00a0An American monitoring team will join the company to ensure compliance with the law as well.<\/p>\n<p>Discussions about the future of ZTE have not been in a vacuum. The United States and China have been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/22\/trump-announces-tariff\/\">hurling barbs on trade back and forth over the past few months<\/a>, over tariffs, market access, and the widening trade deficit between the two countries. The U.S. position has been that the fine against ZTE is a law enforcement action, which should not be included in the continuing discussions around trade.<\/p>\n<p>However, some sources who corresponded with me say that the Chinese government has purposely held up the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors by Qualcomm while it negotiates a more positive outcome for ZTE. China <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/19\/qualcomm-extends-nxp-deal-deadline\/\">remains the only country that has not approved the deal worldwide<\/a>, and it has repeatedly delayed the deal in recent weeks. That provided a valuable chip to negotiate trade deals with the U.S. more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, President Trump is expected to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/06\/06\/politics\/donald-trump-potential-second-day-meeting-kim-jong-un\/index.html\">head to Singapore next week to open talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un<\/a>. China\u2019s influence over North Korea is likely to prove pivotal for the success or failure of those talks, which gave Beijing even more leverage in its discussions with the Trump administration on ZTE.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever its hand, the Trump administration now faces a deeply hostile reaction from Congress, where there is bipartisan opposition to any deal that rehabilitates ZTE. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) <a href=\"http:\/\/thehill.com\/homenews\/senate\/389406-schumer-congress-must-stop-reported-zte-deal-in-its-tracks\">has said publicly<\/a> that \u201cBoth parties in Congress should come together to stop this deal in its tracks.\u201d Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-27\/rubio-sees-supermajority-backing-for-possible-bid-to-block-zte\">floated a proposal for Congress to block this sort of deal<\/a>. Now that the deal is final, we will see if these comments are just hot air, or whether there really is a \u201csupermajority\u201d ready in Congress to overrule the president\u2019s decision here.<\/p>\n<p><i>This story has been updated with analysis and further information. It\u2019s developing, and we will add more information as we have it.<\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After much negotiation with the Trump Administration, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross confirmed this morning that ZTE, the Chinese telecommunications giant, has agreed to a $1 billion fine.

Just like the second time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And it is the second time that is most suspicious. Differing on the preferred nomenclature for a four-year-old suspicious cyber event would not be particularly damning, but Bray&#8217;s narrative of a DDoS is hard to justify with the facts we do know.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@davidbray\/while-i-am-currently-executive-director-for-the-people-centered-internet-coalition-previously-four-93ce38f272e\">In a blog post<\/a> written in response to the report, Bray explained regarding the 2017 outage:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether the correct phrase is denial of service or \u201cbot swarm\u201d or \u201csomething hammering the Application Programming Interface\u201d (API) of the commenting system &#8212; the fact is something odd was happening in May 2017.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Bray&#8217;s analysis appears sincere, but the data he volunteers is highly circumstantial: large amounts of API requests that don&#8217;t match comment counts, for instance, or bunches of RSS requests that tie up the servers. Could it have been a malicious actor doing this? It&#8217;s possible. Could it have been bad code hammering the servers with repeated or malformed requests? Also totally possible. The FCC&#8217;s justification for calling it an attack seems to be nothing more than a hunch.<\/p>\n<p>Later the FCC, via then-CIO Bray, would categorize the event as a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/31\/fcc-says-its-cybersecurity-measures-to-prevent-ddos-attacks-must-remain-secret\/\">&#8220;non-traditional DDoS attack&#8221;<\/a> flooding the API interface. But beyond that it has produced so little information of any import that Congress has had to re-issue its questions in stronger words.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WttWebvi3e\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/23\/representatives-rip-fcc-chairman-pais-lack-of-candor-and-double-down-on-net-neutrality-questions\/\">Representatives rip FCC Chairman Pai&#8217;s &#8216;lack of candor&#8217; and double down on net neutrality questions<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/23\/representatives-rip-fcc-chairman-pais-lack-of-candor-and-double-down-on-net-neutrality-questions\/embed\/#?secret=WttWebvi3e\" data-secret=\"WttWebvi3e\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Representatives rip FCC Chairman Pai&#8217;s &#8216;lack of candor&#8217; and double down on net neutrality questions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>No official documentation of either supposed attack has appeared, nor has the FCC released any data on it, even a year later and long after the comment period has closed, improvements to the system have been made and the CIO who evaded senators&#8217; questions departed.<\/p>\n<p>But most suspicious is the extent to which the FCC redacted documents relating to the 2017 event. Having read through the trove of emails, Gizmodo concludes that &#8220;every internal conversation about the 2017 incident between FCC employees&#8221; has been redacted. Every one!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1652018\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/redact2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"817\" height=\"549\" \/>The FCC stated before that the &#8220;ongoing nature&#8221; of the threats to its systems meant it would &#8220;undermine our system&#8217;s security&#8221; to provide any details on the improvements it had made to mitigate future attacks. And Bray wrote in his post that there was no &#8220;full blown report&#8221; because the team was focused on getting the system up and running again. But there is also an FCC statement saying that &#8220;our analysis reveals&#8221; that a DDoS was the cause.<\/p>\n<p>What analysis? If it&#8217;s not a &#8220;significant cyber incident,&#8221; as the FBI determined, why the secrecy? If there&#8217;s no report or significant analysis from the day \u2014 wrong or right in retrospect \u2014 what is sensitive about the emails that they have to be redacted en masse? Bray himself wrote more technical details into his post than the FCC has offered in the year since the event \u2014 was this information sent to reporters at the time? Was it redacted? Why? So little about this whole information play makes no sense.<\/p>\n<p>One reasonable explanation (and just speculation, I should add) would be that the data do <em>not<\/em> support the idea of an attack, and internal discussions are an unflattering portrait of an agency doing spin work. The commitment to transparency that FCC Chairman Pai so frequently invokes is conspicuously absent in this specific case, and one has to wonder why.<\/p>\n<p>The ongoing refusal to officially document or discuss what all seem to agree was an important event, whether it&#8217;s a DDoS or something else, is making the FCC look bad to just about everyone. No amount of redaction can change that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You may remember the FCC explaining that in both 2014 and 2017, its comment system was briefly taken down by a denial of service attack.

(This is separate from the Seattle Election Commission&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/05\/seattle-says-facebook-broke-one-of-its-campaign-advertising-laws\/\">allegations of similar failings<\/a> by Facebook in February; one is at the city level, the other at the state level.)<\/p>\n<p>All told, Facebook took in about $3.4 million over the last decade, including &#8220;$2.5 million paid through political consultants and other agents or intermediaries, and $619,861 paid directly to Facebook.&#8221; Google received about $1.5 million over the same period, almost none of which was paid directly to the company. (I&#8217;ve asked the AG&#8217;s office for more information on how these amounts are defined.)<\/p>\n<p>The total yearly amounts listed in the lawsuits may be interesting to anyone curious about the scale of political payments to online platforms at the state scale, so I&#8217;m reproducing them here.<\/p>\n<h3>Facebook<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2013<\/strong>: $129,099<\/li>\n<li><strong>2014<\/strong>: $310,165<\/li>\n<li><strong>2015<\/strong>: $147,689<\/li>\n<li><strong>2016<\/strong>: $1,153,688<\/li>\n<li><strong>2017<\/strong>: $857,893<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Google<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2013<\/strong>: $47,431<\/li>\n<li><strong>2014<\/strong>: $72,803<\/li>\n<li><strong>2015<\/strong>: $56,639<\/li>\n<li><strong>2016<\/strong>: $310,175<\/li>\n<li><strong>2017<\/strong>: $295,473<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Note that these don&#8217;t add up to the totals mentioned above; these are the numbers filed with the state&#8217;s Public Disclosure Committee. 2018 amounts are listed but are necessarily incomplete, so I omitted them.)<\/p>\n<p>At least some of the many payments making up these results are not properly documented, and from the looks of it, this could amount to willful negligence.

Yet according to the lawsuits, even basic data like names and addresses of advertisers and the amounts paid were not collected systematically, let alone made available publicly.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5vgan5TJQK\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/27\/facebook-should-disclose-and-limit-pricing-for-political-campaign-ads\/\">Facebook should disclose and limit pricing for political campaign ads<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/27\/facebook-should-disclose-and-limit-pricing-for-political-campaign-ads\/embed\/#?secret=5vgan5TJQK\" data-secret=\"5vgan5TJQK\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook should disclose and limit pricing for political campaign ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible to characterize flouting the law in such a way as an innocent mistake, and certainly not when the mistake is repeated year after year. This isn&#8217;t an academic question: If the companies are found to have <em>intentionally<\/em> violated the law, the lawsuit asks that damages be tripled (technically, &#8220;trebled.&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>Neither company addressed the claims of the lawsuit directly when contacted for comment.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook said in a statement that &#8220;Attorney General Ferguson has raised important questions and we look forward to resolving this matter with his office quickly.&#8221; The company also noted that it has taken several steps to improve transparency in political spending, such as its planned <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/24\/facebook-political-ad-archive\/\">political ad archive<\/a> and an API for requesting this type of data.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0qO00VH7Ha\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/24\/facebook-political-ad-archive\/\">Facebook and Instagram launch US political ad labeling and archive<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/24\/facebook-political-ad-archive\/embed\/#?secret=0qO00VH7Ha\" data-secret=\"0qO00VH7Ha\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook and Instagram launch US political ad labeling and archive&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Google said only that it is &#8220;currently reviewing the complaint and will be engaging with the Attorney General&#8217;s office&#8221; and asserted that it is &#8220;committed&#8221; to transparency and disclosure, although evidently not in the manner Washington requires.<\/p>\n<p>The case likely will not result in significant monetary penalties for the companies in question; even if fines and damages totaled tens of millions it would be a drop in the bucket for the tech giants. But deliberately skirting laws governing political spending and public disclosure is rather a bad look for companies under especial scrutiny for systematic dishonesty \u2014 primarily Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>If the AG&#8217;s suit goes forward and the companies are found to have intentionally avoided doing what the law required, they (and others like them) would be under serious pressure to do so in the future, not just in Washington, but in other states where similar negligence may have taken place. AG Ferguson seems clearly to want to set a precedent and perhaps inspire others to take action.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve asked the AG&#8217;s office for some clarifications and additional info, and will

So they have not respected the regulator. They have not co-operated with the regulator. They are not respecting the law, in my opinion. So that&#8217;s very troubling &#8212; because they seem to be trying to use liquidation to evade their responsibility as far as we can tell.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While he is not a U.K. citizen, Carroll discovered his personal data had been processed in the U.K. so he decided to bring a test case under U.K. law. The ICO supported his complaint &#8212; and last month ordered Cambridge Analytica\/SCL Elections to hand over everything it holds on him, warning that failure to comply with the order is a criminal offense that can carry an unlimited fine.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time &#8212; and pretty much at the height of a storm of publicity around the data misuse scandal &#8212; Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections announced insolvency proceedings,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ca-commercial.com\/news\/cambridge-analytica-and-scl-elections-commence-insolvency-proceedings-and-release-results-3\">blaming<\/a>\u00a0what they described as &#8220;unfairly negative media coverage.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Its <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CamAnalytica?lang=en\">Twitter account<\/a> has been silent ever since.\u00a0Though company directors, senior management and investors were quickly spotted attaching themselves to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2018\/05\/02\/cambridge_analytica_shutdown\/\">yet another data company<\/a>. So the bankruptcy proceedings look rather more like an exit strategy to try to escape the snowballing scandal and cover any associated data trails.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of data trails though.\u00a0Back in April Facebook admitted that data on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/04\/cambridge-analytica-87-million\/\">as many as 87 million of its users<\/a> had been passed to Cambridge Analytica without most of the people&#8217;s knowledge or consent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I expected to help set precedents of data sovereignty in this case. But I did not expect to be trying to also set rules of liquidation as a way to avoid responsibility for potential data crimes,&#8221; Carroll also told the LIBE committee. &#8220;So now that this is seeming to becoming a criminal matter we are now in uncharted waters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seeking full disclosure&#8230; so that I can evaluate if my opinions were influenced for the presidential election. I suspect that they were, I suspect that I was exposed to malicious information that was trying to [influence my vote] &#8212; whether it did is a different question.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He added that he intends to continue to pursue a claim for full disclosure via the courts, arguing that the only way to assess whether <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/29\/heres-cambridge-analyticas-plan-for-voters-facebook-data\/\">psychographic models can successfully be matched to online profiles<\/a>\u00a0for the purposes of manipulating political opinions &#8212; which is what Cambridge Analytica\/SCL stands accused of misusing Facebook data for &#8212; is to see how the company structured and processed the information it sucked out of Facebook&#8217;s platform.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the predictions of my personality are in 80-90% then we can understand that their model has the potential to affect a population &#8212; even if it&#8217;s just a tiny slice of the population. Because in the US only about 70,000 voters in three states decided the election,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<h2>What comes after Cambridge Analytica?<\/h2>\n<p>The LIBE committee hearing in the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/european-union\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"european-union\">European Union&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> parliament is the first of a series of planned sessions focused on digging into the Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal and &#8220;setting out a way forward,&#8221; as committee chair Claude Moraes put it.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s hearing took evidence from former Facebook employee turned whistleblower Sandy\u00a0Parakilas; investigative journalist Carole\u00a0Cadwalladr; Cambridge Analytica whistleblower <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/chris-wylie\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"chris-wylie\">Chris Wylie; <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and the U.K.&#8217;s ICO <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/elizabeth-denham\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"elizabeth-denham\">Elizabeth Denham, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> along with her deputy,\u00a0James Dipple-Johnstone.<\/p>\n<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office has been running a more-than-year-long investigation into political ad targeting on online platforms &#8212; which now of course encompasses the Cambridge Analytica scandal and much more besides.<\/p>\n<p>Denham described it today as &#8220;unprecedented in scale&#8221; &#8212; and likely the largest investigation ever undertaken by a data protection agency in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The inquiry is looking at &#8220;exactly what data went where; from whom; and how that flowed through the system; how that data was combined with other data from other data brokers; what were the algorithms that were processed,&#8221; explained Dipple-Johnstone, who is leading the investigation for the ICO.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re presently working through a huge volume &#8212; many hundreds of terabytes of data &#8212; to follow that audit trail and we&#8217;re committed to getting to the bottom of that,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We are looking at over 30 organizations as part of this investigation and the actions of dozens of key individuals. We&#8217;re investigating social media platforms, data brokers, analytics firms, political parties and campaign groups across all spectrums and academic institutions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking at both regulatory and criminal breaches, and we are working with other regulators, EU data protection colleagues and law enforcement in the U.K. and abroad.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He said the ICO&#8217;s report is now expected to be published at the end of this month.<\/p>\n<p>Denham <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/07\/uk-watchdog-wants-disclosure-rules-for-political-ads-on-social-media\/\">previously told<\/a> a U.K. parliamentary committee she&#8217;s leaning toward recommending a code of conduct for the use of social media in political campaigns to avoid the risk of political uses of the technology getting ahead of the law &#8212; a point she reiterated today.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond data protection I expect my report will be relevant to other regulators overseeing electoral processes and also overseeing academic research,&#8221; she said, emphasizing that the recommendations will be relevant &#8220;well beyond the borders of the U.K.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What is clear is that work will need to be done to strengthen information-sharing and closer working across these areas,&#8221; she added.<\/p>\n<p>Many MEPs asked the witnesses for their views on whether the EU&#8217;s new data protection framework, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/gdpr\/\">GDPR<\/a>, is sufficient to curb the kinds of data abuse and misuse that has been so publicly foregrounded by the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal &#8212; or whether additional regulations are required?<\/p>\n<p>On this Denham made a plea for GDPR to be &#8220;given some time to work.&#8221; &#8220;I think the GDPR is an important step, it&#8217;s one step but remember the GDPR is the law that&#8217;s written on paper &#8212; and what really matters now is the enforcement of the law,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s the activities that data protection authorities are willing to do. It&#8217;s the sanctions that we look at. It&#8217;s the users and the citizens who understand their rights enough to take action &#8212; because we don&#8217;t have thousands of inspectors that are going to go around and look at every system. But we do have millions of users and millions of citizens that can exercise their rights. So it&#8217;s the enforcement and the administration of the law. It&#8217;s going to take a village to change the scenario.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You asked me if I thought this kind of activity which we&#8217;re speaking about today &#8212; involving Cambridge Analytica and Facebook &#8212; is happening on other platforms or if there&#8217;s other applications or if there&#8217;s misuse and misselling of personal data. I would say yes,&#8221; she said in response to another question from an MEP.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even in the political arena there are other political consultancies that are pairing up with data brokers and other data analytics companies. I think there is a lack of transparency for users across many platforms.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Parakilas, a former Facebook platform operations manager &#8212; and the closest stand in for the company in the room &#8212; fielded many of the questions from MEPs, including being asked for suggestions for a legislative framework that &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t put breaks on the development of healthy companies&#8221; and also not be unduly burdensome on smaller companies.<\/p>\n<p>He urged EU lawmakers to think about ways to incentivize a commercial ecosystem that works to encourage rather than undermine data protection and privacy, as well as ensuring regulators are properly resourced to enforce the law.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the GDPR is a really important first step,&#8221; he added. &#8220;What I would say beyond that is there&#8217;s going to have to be a lot of thinking that is done about the next generation of technologies &#8212; and so while I think GDPR does a admirable job of addressing some of the issues with current technologies the stuff that&#8217;s coming is, frankly, when you think about the bad cases is terrifying.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Things like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/30\/deepfakes-fake-videos-darpa-sri-international-media-forensics\/\">deepfakes<\/a>. The ability to create on-demand content that&#8217;s completely fabricated but looks real&#8230; Things like artificial intelligence which can predict user actions before those actions are actually done. And in fact Facebook is just one company that&#8217;s working on this &#8212; but the fact that they have a business model where they could potentially sell the ability to influence future actions using these predictions. There&#8217;s a lot of thinking that needs to be done about the frameworks for these new technologies. So I would just encourage you to engage as soon as possible on those new technologies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Parakilas also discussed\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/03\/facebook-says-it-disagrees-with-the-new-york-times-criticisms-of-its-device-integrated-apis\/\">fresh revelations related to how Facebook&#8217;s platform<\/a>\u00a0disseminates user data published by The New York Times at the weekend.<\/p>\n<p>The newspaper&#8217;s report details how, until April, Facebook&#8217;s API was passing user and friend data to at least 60 device makers without gaining people&#8217;s consent &#8212;\u00a0despite a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/cases\/2012\/08\/120810facebookdo.pdf\">consent decree the company struck with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011<\/a>, which Parakilas suggested &#8220;appears to prohibit that kind of behavior.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He also pointed out the device maker data-sharing &#8220;appears to contradict Facebook&#8217;s own testimony to Congress and potentially other testimony and public statements they&#8217;ve made&#8221; &#8212; given the company&#8217;s repeat claims, since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, that it &#8220;locked down&#8221; data-sharing on its platform in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Yet data was still flowing out to multiple device maker partners &#8212; apparently without users&#8217; knowledge or consent.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is a very, very important developing story. And I would encourage everyone in this body to follow it closely,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Two more LIBE hearings are planned around the Cambridge Analytica scandal &#8212; one on June 25 and one on July 2 &#8212; with the latter slated to include a Facebook representative.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/mark-zuckerberg\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"mark-zuckerberg\">Mark Zuckerberg <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> himself attended a meeting with the EU parliament&#8217;s Council of Presidents on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/22\/zuckerberg-didnt-make-any-friends-in-europe-today\/\">May 22<\/a>, though the format of the meeting was widely criticized for allowing the Facebook founder to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/22\/zuckerberg-eu-testimony\/\">cherry-pick questions<\/a> he wanted to answer &#8212; and dodge those he didn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>MEPs pushed for Facebook to follow up with answers to their many outstanding questions &#8212; and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/resources\/library\/media\/20180524RES04208\/20180524RES04208.pdf\">two<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/resources\/library\/media\/20180604RES04911\/20180604RES04911.pdf\">sets<\/a> of Facebook responses have now been published by the EU parliament.<\/p>\n<p>In its follow up responses the company claims, for example, that it does not create shadow profiles on non-users &#8212; saying it merely collects information on site visitors in the same way that &#8220;any website or app&#8221; might.<\/p>\n<p>On the issue of compensation for EU users affected by the Cambridge Analytica scandal &#8212; something MEPs also pressed Zuckerberg on &#8212; Facebook claims it has not seen evidence that the app developer who harvested people&#8217;s data from its platform on behalf of Cambridge Analytica\/SCL sold any EU users&#8217; data to the company.<\/p>\n<p>The developer, Dr. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/aleksandr-kogan\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"aleksandr-kogan\">Aleksandr Kogan, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> had been contracted by SCL Elections for U.S.-related election work.

groups knock &#8216;unjust&#8217; copyright-extending CLASSICS Act"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Copyright is a mess<\/span>, but more of a mess in some ways than others, and one of the biggest messes right now is licensing music for digital broadcast. The Music Modernization Act aims to smooth over some of the biggest bumps, but a companion piece has aroused the ire of a collection of internet advocacy groups, <a href=\"https:\/\/equalcitizens.us\/fixtheclassicsact\/\">which have voiced their concerns<\/a> via a letter penned by copyright scholar Lawrence Lessig.<\/p>\n<p>The CLASSICS Act is the one in question, though no one is disputing the cleverness of its acronym: it stands for Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society. And indeed the goal of the act is to harmonize copyright for musical works created before 1972, a sort of turning point after which copyright law changed considerably.<\/p>\n<p>The issue at hand, although due to the complexity of copyright any summary will necessarily be somewhat inadequate, is that pre-1972 works are essentially ineligible for federal copyright status, and are instead registered by a hodgepodge of state and common law. This was a pain to start with, to be sure, but as digital transmission of music has increased and federal copyright become more important, it has really started to chafe and the question of royalties has become an increasingly complicated one. (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.plagiarismtoday.com\/2017\/07\/20\/understanding-classics-act\/\">Plagiarism Today<\/a> has a good summary if you want more details.)<\/p>\n<p>What CLASSICS is intended to do is endow those pre-1972 works with a semblance of federal copyright, helping eliminate this arbitrary line on how music is licensed. Sounds good, right? And it mostly is. But there&#8217;s a catch \u2014 or perhaps two catches.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The objective of the whole package is to make much more efficient the process of licensing music in the digital age, and I think that&#8217;s great,&#8221; Lessig told me in an interview. &#8220;But I think, and this is an important line to draw, what we&#8217;re criticizing is that the public doesn&#8217;t benefit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He says the issues came up in discussions with other IP experts and in particular with Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, who Lessig said had faced serious legal obstacles relating to music archives in particular.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;America&#8217;s copyright system needs to be modernized, but not like this,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/equalcitizens.us\/fixtheclassicsact\/\">the letter at Equal Citizens reads<\/a>, &#8220;and certainly not in a fashion that results in excessively long periods of protection, creates massive inconsistencies in the copyrighting of sound recordings, and gives inequitable access to those sound recordings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Co-signatories include Demand Progress, the EFF, Public Knowledge, and the Internet Archive.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1232324\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/copyrightfence.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>A century and a half of protection<\/h2>\n<p>First there is the issue that under CLASSICS, the pre-1972 works are given what amounts to (though is legally not quite the same as) a copyright extension covering them until 2067. Why 2067? That&#8217;s 1972 plus 95 years, the duration a work would be copyrighted if registered today.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just works from 1972 that will be covered up to 2067. Works going back another 50 years will <em>also<\/em> be protected until 2067. In other words, a 1927 recording would be getting what amounts to 140 years of copyright protection.<\/p>\n<p>In case you don&#8217;t see the harm here, consider that such a recording would normally have entered the public domain a handful of years from now, but under CLASSICS would be granted another 42 years, during which royalties would have to be paid and rights managed.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the recurring extension of copyrights over years tends to benefit rights holders more than consumers. At the same time, it&#8217;s hard to imagine something like Mickey the Mouse being public domain, but really, there has to be <em>some<\/em> limit. And for a work to be kept out of the public domain for nearly a century and a half seems fundamentally excessive.<\/p>\n<p>Brewster Kahle told me in an email that CLASSICS &#8220;would not release even Edison wax cylinders into the public domain until 2067 \u2014 nuts, if you ask me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dozens of scholars argued this point <a href=\"https:\/\/equalcitizens.us\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Classics_Act_IP_Professors_Letter_5.14.18.pdf\">in a letter issued in May<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Act is deeply flawed&#8230;Because it grants new federal protections only to works that were created long ago (ranging in age from 46 to 95 years), it does nothing to incentivize the creation of new works. Rather, it simply provides new rewards to existing copyright owners.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Critics point out that the works aren&#8217;t actually being given copyright extensions \u2014 they&#8217;d be governed under a different law. But that has the air of semantics: CLASSICS itself assigns the same &#8220;remedies&#8221; as copyright infringement as punishment for the same crime. It&#8217;s not copyright, but it sure looks, walks and would be prosecuted like copyright. It&#8217;s a sort of white-label copyright, since extending and reducing actual copyright terms is a bit of a difficult issue.<\/p>\n<h2>Retroactive without registration<\/h2>\n<p>But the 2067 thing is just more of the same copyright extension stuff we&#8217;ve seen, Lessig says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people are concerned about the length, and I am too,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;But the 2067 thing doesn&#8217;t matter as much as the idea that you have to do something to earn this right. If you&#8217;re going to give the extension or benefits, at least do it in a way that clarifies the rights to the public.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The main issue is that CLASSICS would apply universally to every work created before 1972, regardless of age, current status, whether the creators are alive and still benefiting and so on. A hit song played daily on oldies stations is given the same rights as an obscure jazz recording no one has ever attempted to monetize or reissue.<\/p>\n<p>The latter works are the type of thing that should be entering the public domain, Lessig and his colleagues argue. Under CLASSICS they are copyright protected by default, and their public domain status delayed by decades when they should be available for free like other old and abandoned media.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see a clear line between works people use and works people have no use for,&#8221; Lessig said.<\/p>\n<p>Let the likes of The Temptations benefit from their hit songs for another century, if that&#8217;s what the government and industry decide is a reasonable term \u2014 all they should have to do is <em>register<\/em> those works.<\/p>\n<p>By having artists and rights owners register, it solves the problem for everyone. Anyone who wants to have their pre-1972 works brought into the new scheme can easily achieve that, but orphan works will enter the public domain as they ought to.<\/p>\n<p>This has the side effect of centralizing and formalizing the copyright status of pre-1972 works; if you&#8217;re a documentary producer or DJ looking for some music to use in your own project, you&#8217;ll be able to easily check if some &#8217;60s record is rights-managed, in which case you can license it, or if it&#8217;s an orphan, in which case you can safely use it like any other public domain work.<\/p>\n<p>Registration has been a sticky issue in IP law, as it isn&#8217;t necessary for the creation of a copyright \u2014 but as this isn&#8217;t creation of copyright, in fact not technically copyright at all in some ways, it&#8217;s an ideal time to introduce the concept to the benefit of the public and with very little if any inconvenience to rights holders.<\/p>\n<p>Music industry coalition <a href=\"http:\/\/musicfirstcoalition.org\/the-coalition\/\">musicFIRST&#8217;s<\/a> executive director, Chris Israel, disagrees: calling registration &#8220;a terrible idea,&#8221; he suggested it was onerous for artists who are already dealing with the pre\/post-1972 complexities to have to &#8220;jump through new legal hoops.&#8221; He was not concerned that many works scheduled to enter the public domain would not do so.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019m concerned about getting protection for the thousands of valuable pre 72 performances being exploited commercially, not exempting them. \u00a0Let\u2019s start with that,&#8221; he wrote in an email.<\/p>\n<p>Arguments for against are necessarily speculative, but all the same there&#8217;s no reason to think that the registration process would be complex, time-consuming, or labor-intensive. It&#8217;s really just a basic filter to separate used from unused works and could even be extracted from some other part of the overall transition process.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve never had a point to leverage this point into the system,&#8221; Lessig said. There&#8217;s still time to add it and it would cost little to do so, he added.<\/p>\n<p>Collective, automatic rights managed at a high level are the domain of large companies that can navigate the agreements and pay the huge fines associated with operating outside their terms while the law catches up with the rest of the world. CLASSICS, Lessig suggested, would benefit these companies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It concentrates their power as a sort of clearing house for intellectual property rights,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Right now we have no way to tell what is protected, which has what rights and why. The people that can do it are companies like Spotify and Google, that can afford the liability. But that doesn&#8217;t make the culture that nobody cares about available to the public.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(NB: Lessig, among others, has been accused of being a paid academic puppet for Google; he laughed at the suggestion, saying &#8220;I&#8217;d love to see one of those checks.&#8221; Many of said scholars have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/17\/google-responds-to-academic-funding-controversy-with-a-gif\/\">similarly rejected the notion<\/a>, though certainly private funding in science must be closely monitored.)<\/p>\n<p>Kahle and others have recommended as an alternative to CLASSICS or even a modified version thereof, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.finance.senate.gov\/imo\/media\/doc\/ACCESS%20to%20Recordings.FINAL.pdf\">a rival bill called ACCESS<\/a>, which takes a simpler approach to federalizing the copyrights of pre-1972 works. Perhaps too simple, critics argue: it would put a lot of work directly in the lap of the Copyright Office, which, like most federal organs, is overworked and inefficient enough as is.<\/p>\n<p>The Music Modernization Act has received remarkable bipartisan support; it passed the House 415-0, which is nothing short of incredible in this day and age. So it seems to be on track to becoming a law. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s perfect, and just as we have ended up kicking ourselves for sloppy wording and a lack of foresight in parts of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, it might be better to take a moment to get it right the first time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Copyright is a mess, but more of a mess in some ways than others, and one of the biggest messes right now is licensing music for digital broadcast.

The Senate will have to confirm Starks, but there&#8217;s no timeline on that yet. Commissioners generally serve five-year terms.<\/p>\n<p>The FCC is kept at an uneven split between the two parties, ideally 3:2 in favor of the current administration.

In fact, as reportage over the last few months has revealed, Maven seems to have been something like a pilot project intended to act as a wedge by which to gain access to other government contracts.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the goal was getting the company&#8217;s security clearance fast-tracked and thus gaining access to data by which it could improve its military-related offerings. And promises to Pentagon representatives detailed far more than facilitation of garden-variety AI work.<\/p>\n<p>Gizmodo&#8217;s sources say that Diane Greene, CEO of Google Cloud, told employees today at a meeting that the backlash was too much and that the company&#8217;s priorities as regards military work have changed. They must have changed recently, since discussions have been ongoing right up until the end of 2017.

the squeeze out of Russia, where regulators are not letting up in their <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/22\/google-confirms-some-of-its-own-services-are-now-getting-blocked-in-russia-over-the-telegram-ban\/\">ongoing attempts<\/a> to block the app because its publishers refuse to provide regulators with access to messages on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Pavel Durov\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/durov\/87\">announced<\/a>\u00a0in a statement on Telegram that the iOS app may be having issues with certain features like stickers after the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/29\/apple-releases-ios-11-4-with-support-for-messages-in-icloud-airplay-2-and-more\/\">iOS 11.4 update<\/a> this week. That is because updates to the app are being prevented globally, he said, by <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> after the Russian regulator ordered Apple (in April) to remove Telegram from the App Store altogether. Durov said this has also meant that Telegram has not been able to issue a GDPR update to comply with the new European regulations that went into effect last week.<\/p>\n<p>For now, Telegram is still in the App Store, albeit with an out-of-date, non-GDPR-compliant version of the app. And confusingly, the move doesn&#8217;t apply to all platforms: the Telegram app for Mac is still updating. Separately, Durov confirmed to TechCrunch that the same issue is not applying to versions in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/google\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"google\">Google <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Play and the Windows store, and that for now Telegram will stay online in Russia.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple has been restricting us from pushing new Telegram versions since mid-April [but] we haven&#8217;t had any such issues with Google Play \/ <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Store. The Android app has been successfully updated many times during the last six weeks,&#8221; he said. Google had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-russia-telegram-stores\/russia-asks-google-and-apple-to-remove-telegram-from-stores-ifax-idUSKBN1HO0ZX\">received a request<\/a> from the Russian regulator at the same time as Apple, on April 17.<\/p>\n<p>In response to questions about whether it will Telegram will get removed altogether, he was unequivocal that it will remain no matter what happens with the stores. &#8220;Telegram is accessible in Russia due to the built-in anti-censorship tools,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>The news caps off what has been a difficult week for Telegram. Days ago, the Russian communications regulator Roskomnadzor (RKN)\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/rkn.gov.ru\/news\/rsoc\/news58106.htm\">announced<\/a> that it had made a formal request to Apple to stop distributing the app, and also to stop enabling push notifications for those who already have the app downloaded in Russia.<\/p>\n<p>Durov&#8217;s full statement, plus some more backstory below that:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unfortunately, some Telegram features, such as stickers, don\u2019t work correctly under iOS 11.4 that was just released \u2013 even though we fixed this issue weeks ago,&#8221; Durov wrote minutes ago in his Telegram channel.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Apple has been preventing Telegram from updating its iOS apps globally ever since the Russian authorities ordered Apple to remove Telegram from the App Store. Russia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users\u2019 communications to Russia\u2019s security agencies. We believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, Apple didn\u2019t side with us. While Russia makes up only 7% of Telegram\u2019s userbase, Apple is restricting updates for all Telegram users around the world since mid-April. As a result, we\u2019ve also been unable to fully comply with GDPR for our EU-users by the deadline of May 25, 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation and will keep you updated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Notably, for now it seems that the app &#8212; an older version of it &#8212; is still available in the App Store. Apple, according to a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.interfax.com\/newsinf.asp?id=835353\">report this week<\/a>, has one month from May 28 to comply with a request to remove it completely. It&#8217;s not clear what the consequences would be if it failed to do so.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We sent them [Apple] a legally binding letter and are awaiting their legally binding reply. Because Apple, like other transnational companies, is a company with a high degree of red tape, we expect the reply within a month,&#8221; RKN&#8217;s head Alexander Zharov said to Russian news agency Interfax.<\/p>\n<p>RKN has been seeking to shut down use of Telegram in the country for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/16\/russia-starts-blocking-telegram-for-failing-to-turn-over-encryption-keys\/\">months<\/a>, but for most of that time Telegram has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/17\/telegram-plays-down-russia-block-claiming-no-significant-impact-yet\/\">working around the issue<\/a> by appealing to people to use VPNs to access the service, and also by hopping around IPs at hosting companies sympathetic to its attempt to continue offering its service without sharing data with Russian authorities.<\/p>\n<p>Its hopping had the unintended consequence of RKN knocking out entire swathes of IP addresses to stop Telegram, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/19\/russias-game-of-telegram-whack-a-mole-grows-to-19m-blocked-ips-hitting-twitch-spotify-and-more\/\">some 19 million at its peak<\/a>, causing a number of other services to go down as well. But even so, the app has gone viral with the attention, which had also <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/durov\/82\">prompted a number of protests<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But despite the attention, it is unclear how this might have translated to usage and app installs. The most recent figures released by Telegram note that there are about 200 million monthly active users, with 14 million in Russia, although those figures predate the scuffle with Russian regulators. Downloads as tracked by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appannie.com\/apps\/ios\/app\/telegram-messenger-2\/rank-history\/?vtype=day&amp;countries=US,RU&amp;device=iphone&amp;view=rank&amp;legends=22%7C22&amp;date=2018-03-02~2018-05-31\">AppAnnie<\/a>, in fact, seem to point to a slight dip in downloads in Russia after the RKN blocks started in April, although those numbers only count App Store downloads.<\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly, and maybe because of how popular the resistance was proving to be, it looked like several of the key cloud hosting companies, such as Google and Amazon&#8217;s AWS, where Telegram along with many other sites and apps host their data and operations, had decided to hold firm to see how things would develop, even when their <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/22\/google-confirms-some-of-its-own-services-are-now-getting-blocked-in-russia-over-the-telegram-ban\/\">own consumer-facing services<\/a> were suffering.<\/p>\n<p>So it seemed only a matter of time before RKN would soon turn to app store operators to turn the screws further. Apple, it seems, has been the first to go down, specifically with regards to updating the app in the App Store. Logically, it seems that the Play Store and others might also feel the squeeze, too.<\/p>\n<p>We are contacting Apple for further comment, and also Google to see if the Play Store is also being affected, and we will update this post as we learn more.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated with response from Pavel Durov.

Finding little situational awareness, few standard processes for reporting or managing attacks and almost no agencies adequately performing even basic encryption, the OMB concluded that &#8220;the current situation is untenable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>All told, nearly three quarters of federal agencies have cybersecurity programs that qualified as either &#8220;at risk&#8221; (significant gaps in security) or &#8220;high risk&#8221; (fundamental processes not in place).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Cybersecurity-Risk-Determination-Report-FINAL_May-2018-Release.pdf\">The report, which you can read here<\/a>, lists four major findings, each of which with its own pitiful statistics and recommendations that occasionally amount to a complete about-face or overhaul of existing policies.<\/p>\n<h2>1. &#8220;Agencies do not understand and do not have the resources to combat the current threat environment.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>The simple truth and perhaps origin of all these problems is that the federal government is a slow-moving beast that can&#8217;t keep up with the nimble threat of state-sponsored hackers and the rapid pace of technology. The simplest indicator of this problem is perhaps this: of the 30,899 (!) known successful compromises of federal systems in FY 2016, 11,802 of them never even had their threat vector identified.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IsP9LvBiqc\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/15\/russia-energy-hack-dhs-fbi-us-cert\/\">DHS and FBI detail how Russia is hacking into U.S. nuclear facilities and other critical infrastructure<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/15\/russia-energy-hack-dhs-fbi-us-cert\/embed\/#?secret=IsP9LvBiqc\" data-secret=\"IsP9LvBiqc\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;DHS and FBI detail how Russia is hacking into U.S. nuclear facilities and other critical infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t38 percent of attacks had no identified method or attacker.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\tSo for 38 percent of successful attacks, they don&#8217;t have a clue who did it or how!<\/p>\n<p>This lack of situational awareness means that even if they have budgets in the billions, these agencies don&#8217;t have the capability to deploy them effectively.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While cyber spending increases year-over-year, OMB found that agencies are not effectively using available information, such as threat intelligence, incident data, and network traffic flow data to determine the extent that assets are at risk, or inform how they to prioritize resource allocations.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To this end, the OMB will be working with agencies on a threat-based budget model, looking at what is actually possible to affect the agency, what is in place to prevent it and what specifically needs to be improved.<\/p>\n<h2>2. &#8220;Agencies do not have standardized cybersecurity processes and IT capabilities.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s immense variety in the tasks and capabilities of our many federal agencies, but you would think that some basics would have been established along the lines of best practices for reporting, standard security measures to lock down secure systems and so on. Nope!<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For example, one agency lists no fewer than 62 separately managed email services in its environment, making it virtually impossible to track and inspect inbound and outbound communications across the agency.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t51 percent of agencies can&#8217;t detect or whitelist software running on their systems\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\tOnly half of the agencies the OMB looked at said they have the ability to detect and whitelist software running on their systems. Now, while it may only be needed on a case by case basis for IT to manage users&#8217; apps and watch for troubling processes, well, the capability should at least be there!<\/p>\n<p>When something happens, things are little better: 59 percent of agencies have some kind of standard process for communicating cyber threats to their users. So, for example, if one of their 62 email systems has been compromised, the agency as likely as not has no good way to notify everyone about it.<\/p>\n<p>And only 30 percent have &#8220;predictable, enterprise-wide incident response processes in place,&#8221; meaning once the threat has been detected, only one in three has some kind of standard procedure for who to tell and what to tell them.<\/p>\n<p>Establishing standard processes for cybersecurity and general harmony in computing resources is something the OMB has been working on for a long time. Too bad <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/15\/white-house-sheds-cyber-coordinator-role\/\">the position of cyber coordinator just got eliminated<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HaKgpHyrk8\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/15\/white-house-sheds-cyber-coordinator-role\/\">White House sheds cyber coordinator role<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/15\/white-house-sheds-cyber-coordinator-role\/embed\/#?secret=HaKgpHyrk8\" data-secret=\"HaKgpHyrk8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;White House sheds cyber coordinator role&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>3. &#8220;Agencies lack visibility into what is occurring on their networks, and especially lack the ability to detect data exfiltration.&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>Monitoring your organization&#8217;s data and traffic, both internal and external, is a critical part of any cybersecurity plan. Time and again federal agencies have proven susceptible to all kinds of exfiltration schemes, from USB keys to phishing for login details.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t73 percent can&#8217;t detect attempts to access large volumes of data.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\tTurns out that only 27 percent of the agencies even &#8220;have the ability to detect and investigate attempts to access large volumes of data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Simply put, agencies cannot detect when large amounts of information leave their networks, which is particularly alarming in the wake of some of the high-profile incidents across government and industry in recent years.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hard to secure your data if you can&#8217;t see where it&#8217;s going. After the &#8220;high-profile incidents&#8221; to which the OMB report alludes, one would think that detection and lockdown of data repositories would be one of the first efforts these agencies would make.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the total lack of insight into how and why these things occur. Only 17 percent of agencies analyzed incident response data after the fact, so maybe they just filed the incidents away, never to be looked at again.<\/p>\n<p>The OMB has a smart way to start addressing this: one agency that has its act together will be designated a &#8220;SOC [Secure Operations Center] Center of Excellence.&#8221; (Yes, &#8220;Center&#8221; is there twice.) This SOC will offer secure storage and access as a service to other agencies while the latter improve or establish their own facilities.<\/p>\n<h2>4. &#8220;Agencies lack standardized and enterprise-wide processes for managing cybersecurity risks&#8221;<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a bit of overlap with 2 here, but redundancy is the name of the game when it comes to the U.S. government. This one is a bit more focused on the leadership itself.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While most agencies noted&#8230; that their leadership was actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management, many did not, or could not, elaborate in detail on leadership engagement above the CIO level.<\/p>\n<p>Federal agencies possess neither robust risk management programs nor consistent methods for notifying leadership of cybersecurity risks across the agency.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t84 percent of agencies failed to meet goals for encrypting data at rest.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\tIn other words, cyber is being left to the cyber-guys, with little guidance or clout offered by the higher-ups at the agencies. That&#8217;s important because, as the OMB notes, many decisions or requests can only be made by those higher-ups. For example, budgetary concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Despite &#8220;repeated calls from industry leaders, GAO [the Government Accountability Office], and privacy advocates&#8221; to utilize encryption wherever possible, less than 16 percent of agencies achieved their targets for encrypting data at rest. Sixteen percent! Encrypting at rest isn&#8217;t even that hard!<\/p>\n<p>Turns out this is an example of under-investment by the powers that be. Non-defense agencies budgeted a total between them of under $51 million on encrypting data in FY 2017, which is extremely little even before you consider that half of <em>that<\/em> came from two agencies. How are even motivated IT departments supposed to migrate to encrypted storage when they have no money to hire the experts or get the equipment necessary to do so?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Agencies have demonstrated that this is a low priority&#8230;it is easy to see government\u2019s priorities must be realigned,&#8221; the OMB remarked.<\/p>\n<p>While the conclusion of the report isn&#8217;t as gloomy as the body, it&#8217;s clear that the OMB&#8217;s researchers are deeply disappointed by what they found. This is hardly a new issue, despite the current president&#8217;s designation of it as a key issue \u2014 the previous presidents did as well, but movement has been slow and halting, punctuated by disastrous breaches and embarrassing leaks.<\/p>\n<p>The report declines to name and shame the offending agencies, perhaps because their failings and successes were diverse and no one deserved worse treatment than another, but it seems highly likely that in less public channels those agencies are not being spared. Hopefully this damning report will put spurs to the efforts that have been limping along for the last decade.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Office of Management and Budget reports that the federal government is a shambles \u2014 cybersecurity-wise, anyway.

<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> polices hate speech and hate organizations on its platform.

For one, according to a series of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/4487118-Facebook-Hatespeech-Slides-1.html\">internal slides on white supremacy,<\/a>\u00a0Facebook walks a fine line that arguably doesn&#8217;t exist at all. According to these post-Charlottesville training documents, the company opted to officially differentiate between white nationalism and white supremacy, allowing the former and forbidding the latter.<\/p>\n<h2>White nationalism gets the green light<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook appears to take the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy seriously, but many white nationalists don&#8217;t, opting only for the slightly more benign term to soften their image. This is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/news\/nation\/2017\/08\/14\/clash-highlights-extremists-skill-bending-words\/EQZAyrZrOiLki5gWsJc03H\/story.html\">well-<\/a>documented phenomenon, as anyone who has spent time in these online circles can attest. It&#8217;s also the first sentence in the Anti Defamation League (ADL) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/glossary-terms\/white-nationalism\">entry on white nationalism<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>White nationalism is a term that originated among white supremacists as a euphemism for white supremacy.<\/p>\n<p>Eventually, some white supremacists tried to distinguish it further by using it to refer to a form of white supremacy that emphasizes defining a country or region by white racial identity and which seeks to promote the interests of whites exclusively, typically at the expense of people of other backgrounds.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/mbk7ky\/leaked-facebook-neo-nazi-policies-white-supremacy-nationalism-separatism\">Motherboard<\/a> reports, Facebook notes &#8220;overlaps with white nationalism\/separatism&#8221; as a challenge in its relevant training notes section for white supremacy, adding that &#8220;Media reports also use the terms interchangeably (for example referring to David Duke as white supremacist even though he doesn&#8217;t explicitly identify himself as one).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s own articulation of white supremacy offers considerable concessions:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Although there doesn&#8217;t seem to be total agreement among academics on whether white supremacy <strong>always\u00a0<\/strong>implies racial\u00a0<strong>hatred<\/strong>, the fact that it is based on a <strong>racist premise<\/strong>\u00a0is widely acknowledged. [original emphasis]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Most of Facebook&#8217;s slides on hate speech and hate groups read like an embarrassingly\u00a0simplistic CliffsNotes, lacking nuance and revealing the company&#8217;s apparently slapdash approach to the issue of racial hate. Tellingly, some portions of Facebook&#8217;s training text copy Wikipedia&#8217;s own language verbatim.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the first few sentences of the Wikipedia entry on white supremacy:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>White supremacy or white supremacism is a racist ideology based upon the belief that white people are superior in many ways to people of other races and that therefore white people should be dominant over other races.<\/p>\n<p>White supremacy has roots in scientific racism and it often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose members of other races as well as Jews.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s training note on white supremacy, with differences bolded:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>White supremacy or white supremacism is a racist ideology based upon the belief that white people are superior in many ways to people of other races and that therefore white people should be dominant over other races. White supremacy has roots in scientific racism and it often relies on pseudoscientific arguments. Like most similar movements such as neo-Nazism, white supremacists typically oppose <strong>people of color, Jews and non-Protestants.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_1647356\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1647356 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-29-at-12-03-04-pm.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Facebook slides recreated by Motherboard<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Bafflingly, Facebook also notes that &#8220;White nationalism and calling for an exclusively white state is not a violation for our policy unless it explicitly excludes other PCs [protected characteristics]&#8221; which by definition, a white state does.<\/p>\n<p>According to slides recreated by Motherboard, Facebook asserts that &#8220;we don&#8217;t allow praise, support and representation of\u00a0<strong>white supremacy<\/strong> as an ideology&#8221; but stipulates that it does &#8220;allow praise, support and representation&#8221; for both white nationalism and white separatism. [Again, emphasis theirs.]<\/p>\n<p>Facebook further clarifies:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>By the same token, we allow to call for the creation of white ethno-states (e.g. &#8220;The US should be a white-only nation&#8221;).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>White supremacy versus white nationalism<\/h2>\n<p>By failing to recognize the political motivations behind white nationalism as an identity, Facebook legitimates white nationalism as something meaningfully distinct from white supremacy. While not all white nationalists call for the dream of a white ethnostate to be achieved through racial domination \u2014 and arguably the two could be studied distinctly from a purely academic perspective \u2014 they have far more in common than they have differences. Even with such thin sourcing, Facebook has devoted a surprising amount of language to differentiating the two.<\/p>\n<p>In grappling with this question after\u00a0Charlottesville, the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.ap.org\/behind-the-news\/how-to-describe-extremists-who-rallied-in-charlottesville\">Associated Press<\/a> offered this clarification for its own coverage:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>For many people the terms can be used almost interchangeably. Both terms describe groups that favor whites and support discrimination by race.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The AP also mentions the &#8220;subtle difference&#8221; that white supremacists believe whites to be superior.<\/p>\n<p>For white nationalists, that attitude at times appears more implicit than explicit but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not there. From my own reading and considerable hours spent immersed online in white nationalist groups and forums, there is massive observable ideological overlap between the two groups. The instances in which white supremacists and white nationalists truly espouse wholly distinct ideologies are rare.<\/p>\n<p>Further, it&#8217;s impossible to ignore that violence against non-whites is a central thread running throughout white nationalism, whether stated or implied. Imagining a white ethnostate that does not directly come about at the cost of the safety, wellbeing and financial security of racial minorities is pure fantasy \u2014 a fantasy Facebook is apparently content to entertain in pretending that the &#8220;white state&#8221; would not &#8220;explicitly exclude&#8221; anyone based on the protected characteristic of race.<\/p>\n<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC)\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/fighting-hate\/extremist-files\/ideology\/white-nationalist\">defines white nationalism<\/a> in similarly broad strokes, tying it directly to white supremacy and stating that\u00a0&#8220;white nationalist groups espouse white supremacist or white separatist ideologies, often focusing on the alleged inferiority of nonwhites.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The SPLC, an organization devoted to studying hate, explains the expedient fallacy of the white ethnostate as a nonviolent goal:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>These racist aspirations are most commonly articulated as the desire to form a white ethnostate \u2014 a calculated idiom favored by white nationalists in order to obscure the inherent violence of such a radical project. Appeals for the white ethnostate are often disingenuously couched in proclamations of love for members of their own race, rather than hatred for others.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Apparently, Facebook ignored most dissenting definitions linking white nationalist goals directly to white supremacy. Naively or not, the company bought into white supremacy&#8217;s slightly more palatable public-facing image in shaping its policy platforms.\u00a0In sourcing its policies, Facebook was apparently content to pick and choose which points supported its decision to allow white nationalism on its platform while supposedly casting out white supremacy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;White nationalist groups espouse white separatism and white supremacy,&#8221; the Wikipedia page that Facebook drew from states.\u00a0&#8220;Critics argue that the term &#8216;white nationalism&#8217; and ideas such as white pride exist solely to provide a sanitized public face for white supremacy, and that most white nationalist groups promote racial violence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sadly, for anyone who has watched many virulent strains of racism <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/16\/hatespeech-white-supremacy-nazis-social-networks\/\">flourish and even organize on Facebook<\/a>, the company&#8217;s shoddily crafted internal guidance on white supremacy comes as little surprise. Nor does the fact that the company failed to dedicate even a sliver of its considerable resources to understanding the nuance of white supremacist movements, aims and language.<\/p>\n<p>We reached out to Facebook to see if these alarmingly reductive policies on racial hate have evolved in recent months (these materials are less than a year old), but the company only pointed us to the broad public-facing\u00a0 &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/communitystandards\/introduction\/\">Community Standards<\/a>.&#8221; Any further detail on the actual implementation of policies around hate remains opaque.<\/p>\n<p>Though it may have learned some harsh lessons in 2018, for Facebook, opacity is always the best policy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In an ongoing series over at Motherboard, we&#8217;re learning quite a bit about how Facebook polices hate speech and hate organizations on its platform.

announces timeline for 25% tariff on Chinese tech products"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/22\/trump-announces-tariff\/\">After significant back-and-forth over the past few months<\/a>, the White House intends to follow through with a pledge to place tariffs on imported Chinese technology goods while also tightening restrictions on investments by Chinese firms into American companies.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/statement-steps-protect-domestic-technology-intellectual-property-chinas-discriminatory-burdensome-trade-practices\/?utm_source=twitter\">In a statement posted by the White House<\/a> this morning, the administration said that it would impose a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of Chinese high-tech goods \u201ccontaining industrially significant technology.\u201d That follows the conclusion of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/ustr.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/Section%20301%20FINAL.PDF\">Section 301 investigation into China\u2019s industrial and intellectual property policies<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/04\/some-data-science-on-the-newly-released-trump-and-china-tariffs\/\">What goods will be included in the tariff policy has been up for debate<\/a>, but the final list will be released on June 15th. This package of tariffs is different than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/business\/wp\/2018\/03\/01\/white-house-planning-major-announcement-thursday-on-steel-and-aluminum-imports\/\">a separate package of tariffs focused on steel and aluminum production<\/a> announced earlier this year.<\/p>\n<p>The regulations around investment restrictions by Chinese companies will be announced at the end of June. The administration will also continue to <a href=\"http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/finance\/380009-us-launches-trade-case-against-china-over-licensing-practices\">litigate a case at the World Trade Organization over intellectual property protections<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>All of these announcements should be taken with a shaker\u2019s worth of salt though, since these are just the latest cards being played in a series of interconnected negotiations both internal to the White House and external with the Chinese government.<\/p>\n<p>Internally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/trump-advisers-steve-mnuchin-and-peter-navarro-got-into-a-profanity-laced-screaming-match-on-the-china-trip\">the White House has been riven with differences<\/a> over how aggressively to prosecute the Chinese over its industry practices, with financiers like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin taking a more flexible line while others like U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Director of the White House National Trade Council Peter Navarro have pushed for a much more aggressive approach. As different actors curry favor with President Donald Trump, their respective policies seem to appear and disappear.<\/p>\n<p>Externally, the U.S. and China are engaged in a protracted multi-dimensional negotiation over the status of trade between the two countries. That includes both <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/19\/qualcomm-extends-nxp-deal-deadline\/\">the approval of Qualcomm\u2019s merger with NXP from the U.S. side<\/a>, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/25\/trump-says-zte-will-pay-1-3b-fine-and-overhaul-its-management-to-continue-us-business\/\">re-authorizing a tech export license to China\u2019s telecommunications manufacturer ZTE<\/a> on the Chinese side. Expect more announcements and counter-announcements to come in the coming weeks as these negotiations continue.<\/p>\n<p>For tech companies and startups, the uncertainty and lack of clarity around these tariff policies is difficult to manage. Product road maps and supply chains are being reconsidered as each new policy gets announced, making it difficult to manage future launches. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/19\/tech-industry-opposes-trump-tariffs\/\">While no one wants a tariff in the tech industry<\/a>, clarity would certainly make any tariff much easier to stomach.<\/p>\n<p>Even more challenging is the looming deadline for the announcement of investment restrictions. Given that venture capital rounds generally take several weeks to close because of the due diligence process, and the deadline for the announcement of these new investment restrictions is at the end of June, Silicon Valley founders should be hesitant to accept Chinese VC dollars while they await regulatory certainty from Washington.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve written before that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/24\/the-national-security-implications-of-chinese-venture-capitalists-are-overblown\/\">the national security implications of Chinese venture capitalists are overblown<\/a>, but ultimately, the administration is going to have to develop a rule, and until more information is provided, any investment from a Chinese-connected firm could potentially be cut off at the last minute.

China and data sovereignty are ultimately wins for Amazon and Google"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The Great Privacy Policy Email Deluge of 2018 may have finally petered out, but we are just starting to build an understanding of who the winners and losers will be in this newly regulated data economy.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the attention so far has been focused on the losers post-GDPR, which can be broadly summarized as \u201cadvertising networks.\u201d Indeed, as <a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/gdpr-mayhem-programmatic-ad-buying-plummets-europe\/\">Jessica Davies at Digiday reported over the weekend<\/a>, programmatic advertising in Europe plummeted post-GDPR this weekend, potentially threatening profits at product lines like Google\u2019s DoubleClick network (at least temporarily, until they figure out all the compliance issues).<\/p>\n<p>However, the more interesting analysis is around who the winners of these laws will be (besides the lawyers of course). To me, it\u2019s clear that the complexity around these data sovereignty laws ultimately benefits highly scaled service providers who can manage the nuanced regulations around these laws in an automated fashion. That means, ironically, that Google likely will win long-term on its cloud side, along with other major cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft Azure.<\/p>\n<p>Data used to be much simpler. Gone are my experimental teenage years of collecting user information on a school website and storing it on a MySQL database hosted on my personal computer in my home office with nary a privacy policy in sight (site uptime was about 80 percent, as I turned off the computer at night). Hosting your own data was easy, fast and pretty much the Wild West when it came to any kind of legal or policy enforcement, as any startup in its early days can attest.<\/p>\n<p>That free market in data is rapidly disintegrating as governments increasingly take an interest in data, not just for privacy reasons, but also for population thought control and economic growth purposes. For software developers writing applications, that portends a complicated world for managing global and even potentially national data laws \u2014 a context that is going to be deeply enriching for service providers who can successfully help clients navigate this new world.<\/p>\n<p>These new laws can be broadly grouped under the term \u201cdata sovereignty,\u201d which is one of those terms you say at the World Economic Forum to sound like you are in the know. The goal of these laws is to move data away from the geographically agnostic world of cyberspace, and plant those records directly under local jurisdictions. In short, data sovereignty is where data and meatspace connect, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/12\/26\/the-clouds-biggest-threat-are-data-sovereignty-laws\/\">it is something we have covered on TechCrunch for some time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/20\/wtf-is-gdpr\/\">the European Union\u2019s GDPR regulation<\/a> has gotten the most press (probably because of the several dozen emails you received about it), the EU is hardly the only government enhancing its data sovereignty. China placed into force <a href=\"https:\/\/assets.kpmg.com\/content\/dam\/kpmg\/cn\/pdf\/en\/2017\/02\/overview-of-cybersecurity-law.pdf\">a law requiring all cloud computing and Chinese customer data to be hosted on China-based servers<\/a>, and Russia has also been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/wired-awake-180418\">blocking Google and Amazon cloud services in an increasing war with Telegram<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/itif.org\/publications\/2017\/05\/01\/cross-border-data-flows-where-are-barriers-and-what-do-they-cost\">Many other countries<\/a> have laws affecting how data can be stored and transmitted as well.<\/p>\n<p>These laws are quite different, but they all serve the same purpose \u2014 to bring data back home and ensure that the desires of a country\u2019s people (and, of course, its leaders) can be imprinted on how that data is used.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the challenge: These laws are enormously complicated and completely incompatible with one another. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eugdpr.org\/gdpr-faqs.html\">For all the questions about GDPR<\/a>, it is perhaps the easiest one of the batch to handle. China\u2019s regulations around the cloud are so opaque, it\u2019s not even clear that the Beijing government knows exactly what its law entails. As Samm Sacks, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.csis.org\/analysis\/chinas-emerging-data-privacy-system-and-gdpr\">put it in a lengthy analysis<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Even as the [Chinese] government pushes to put in place a new regulatory framework around how data is managed and shared, there does not yet appear to be a higher-level consensus around how to do this in practice. From issues around cross-border data flows and what constitutes \u201cimportant data,\u201d to how to balance development of emerging technologies like AI with growing demands by Chinese users for data privacy, there is still unresolved internal debate in China about what this all should look like.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_1647152\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1647152\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/5455926421_a28a3ebf0d_o.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">China&#8217;s new cloud law remains as opaque as the Beijing atmosphere<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Multiply that complexity by dozens of governments around the world creating their own standards. Even within the United States, data laws are increasingly being drafted at the state level. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/05\/13\/business\/california-data-privacy-ballot-measure.html\">California\u2019a legislature is debating a bill<\/a> that could bring a sort of GDPR-lite protocol to the Golden State. These laws force startups and large companies alike to potentially adapt to dozens of variations just to stay legal.<\/p>\n<p>Once simple, data is now ridiculously complicated. What data to collect, where and when it can be stored, and what it can be used for are increasingly questions that require significant legal work to answer. Startups and even Fortune 500 companies are in no position to be able to handle these complexities without significant assistance.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where I think the cloud providers are going to strike even more gold. Storing your own data isn\u2019t just risky from a security perspective, it is also increasingly untenable in the fast currents of this data sovereignty world. Is every Fortune 500 company going to start building data centers in countries throughout the world just to stay legal? In the past, that answer was perhaps a bit more blurry, but today it is obvious: Everything is going to have to move to the cloud; the sooner the better.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that Google and Amazon have great data governance products \u2014 quite the contrary, in fact. But don\u2019t be surprised when they announce features this year that increasingly handle these data sovereignty problems.

dashed.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http:\/\/europa.eu\/rapid\/press-release_SPEECH-18-3962_en.htm\">speech<\/a> at the weekend in front of the International Federation for European Law, the EU&#8217;s chief Brexit negotiator,\u00a0Michel Barnier, shot down the notion of anything other than a so-called &#8216;adequacy decision&#8217; being on the table for the UK after it exits the bloc.<\/p>\n<p>If granted, an adequacy decision is an EU mechanism for enabling citizens&#8217; personal data to more easily flow from the bloc to third countries &#8212; as the UK will be after Brexit.<\/p>\n<p>Such decisions are only granted by the <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/european-commission\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"european-commission\">European Commission <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> after a review of a third country&#8217;s privacy standards that&#8217;s intended to determine that they offer essentially equivalent protections as EU rules.<\/p>\n<p>But the mechanism does not allow for the third country to be involved, in any shape or form, in discussions around forming and shaping the EU&#8217;s rules themselves. So, in the UK&#8217;s case, the country would be going from having a seat at the rule-making table to being shut out of the process entirely &#8212; at time when the EU is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/20\/wtf-is-gdpr\/\">really setting the global agenda<\/a> on digital regulations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The United Kingdom decided to leave our harmonised system of decision-making and enforcement. It must respect the fact that the European Union will continue to work on the basis of this system, which has allowed us to build a single market, and which allows us to deepen our single market in response to new challenges,&#8221; said Barnier in Lisbon on Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And, as indicated in the European Council guidelines, the UK must understand that the only possibility for the EU to protect personal data is through an adequacy decision. It is one thing to be inside the Union, and another to be outside.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Brexit is not, and never will be, in the interest of EU businesses,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And it will especially run counter to the interests of our businesses if we abandon our decision-making autonomy. This autonomy allows us to set standards for the whole of the EU, but also to see these standards being replicated around the world. This is the normative power of the Union, or what is often called &#8216;the Brussels effect&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And we cannot, and will not, share this decision-making autonomy with a third country, including a former Member State who does not want to be part of the same legal ecosystem as us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/09\/brexit-data-transfer-gaps-a-risk-for-uk-startups-mps-told\/\">Earlier this month<\/a>\u00a0the UK&#8217;s Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, told MPs on the UK parliament&#8217;s committee for exiting the European Union that a bespoke data agreement that gave the ICO a continued role after Brexit would be a far superior option to an adequacy agreement &#8212; pointing out that the UK stands to lose influence at a time when the EU is setting global privacy standards via the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into full force last Friday.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt this time when the GDPR is in its infancy, participating in shaping and interpreting the law I think is really important. And the group of regulators that sit around the table at the EU are the most influential blocs of regulators \u2014 and if we\u2019re outside of that group and we\u2019re an observer we\u2019re not going to have the kind of effect that we need to have with big tech companies. Because that\u2019s all going to be decided by that group of regulators,&#8221; she warned.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/law\/law-topic\/data-protection\/reform\/rules-business-and-organisations\/enforcement-and-sanctions\/enforcement\/what-european-data-protection-board-edpb_en\">European Data Protection Board<\/a> will set the weather when it comes to standards for artificial intelligence, for technologies, for regulating big tech. So we will be a less influential regulator, we will continue to regulate the law and protect UK citizens as we do now, but we won\u2019t be at the leading edge of interpreting the GDPR \u2014 and we won\u2019t be bringing British values to that table if we\u2019re not at the table.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>She also pointed out that without a bespoke arrangement to accommodate the ICO her office would also be shut out of participating in the GDPR&#8217;s one-stop shop, which allows EU data protection agencies to work together and\u00a0co-ordinate regulatory actions,\u00a0and which she said &#8220;would bring huge advantages to both sides and also to British businesses&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Huge advantages that the UK stands to lose as a result of Brexit.<\/p>\n<p>With the ICO being excluded from participating in GDPR&#8217;s one-stop shop mechanism, it also means UK businesses will have to choose an alternative data protection agency within the EU to act as their lead regulator after Brexit &#8212; putting yet another burden on startups as they will need to build new relationships with a regulator in the EU.<\/p>\n<p>The Irish Data Protection Commission seems the likely candidate for UK companies to look to after Brexit, when the ICO is on the side lines of GDPR, given shared language and proximity. (And Ireland&#8217;s DPC has been ramping up its headcount in anticipation of handling more investigations as a result of the new regulation.)<\/p>\n<p>But UK businesses would clearly prefer to be able to continue working with their domestic regulator. Unfortunately, though,\u00a0Brexit closes the door on that option.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the ICO for comment and will update this story with any response.<\/p>\n<p>The UK government has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/02\/01\/on-data-protection-brexit-means-mirroring-eu-rules-confirms-uk-minister\/\">committed to aligning the country with GDPR<\/a> regardless of Brexit &#8212; as it seeks to avoid the economic threat of EU-UK data flows being cut off if it&#8217;s not judged to be providing adequate data protection.<\/p>\n<p>Looking ahead that also essentially means the UK will need to keep its regulatory regime aligned with the EU&#8217;s in perpetuity &#8212; or risk being deemed inadequate, with, once again, the risk of data flows being cut of (or at very least businesses scrambling to put in place alternative legal arrangements to authorize their data flows, and saddled with the expense of doing so, as happened when <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/06\/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s\/\">Safe Harbor was struck down in 2015<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>So, thanks to Brexit, it will be the rest of Europe setting the agenda on regulating AI &#8212; with the UK bound to follow.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the UK&#8217;s Department for Exiting the EU told us:\u00a0&#8220;Our Information Commissioner\u2019s Office [is] well-respected and it is in the mutual interest of the UK and the EU for the ICO and EU data protection authorities to work together. Negotiations are ongoing in this regard.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Adequacy does not reflect the full depth and breadth of the UK-EU relationship. It is an effective means of ensuring the free flow of data between the EU and a third country, but it would not allow national data protection authorities to co-operate as effectively as they do now.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As it currently exists, adequacy alone would lead to more bureaucracy and additional costs for businesses.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>This report was updated with comment from DExEU<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The UK&#8217;s hopes of retaining an influential role for its data protection agency in shaping European Union regulations post-Brexit &#8212; including helping to set any new Europe-wide rules around artificial intelligence &#8212; look well and truly dashed.

Administration would streamline federal oversight of commercial launches"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>As part of an ongoing effort to improve the regulatory conditions weathered by companies doing business in space, the Commerce Department has proposed to unify several offices under a new banner: the Space Policy Advancing Commercial Enterprise Administration.<\/p>\n<p>The Trump administration offered hints, but few hard details, on how it aims to streamline federal oversight of space in a statement issued this week. Space Policy Directive 1 had to do with pursuing missions to the moon and Mars, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/briefings-statements\/president-donald-j-trump-reforming-modernizing-american-commercial-space-policy\/\">Directive 2<\/a> is more about housekeeping.<\/p>\n<p>Part of that housekeeping directs Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. to &#8220;transmit a plan to create a &#8216;one-stop shop&#8217; within the Department of Commerce for administering and regulating commercial space flight activities,&#8221; and he seems to have been eager to comply.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At my department alone, there are six bureaus involved in the space industry. A unified departmental office for business needs will enable better coordination of space-related activities,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/articles\/moon-colony-will-reality-sooner-think\/\">Ross wrote<\/a>. &#8220;When companies seek guidance on launching satellites, the Space Administration will be able to address an array of space activities, including remote sensing, economic development, data-purchase policies, GPS, spectrum policy, trade promotion, standards and technology and space-traffic management.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of these changes have been talked about for a while, so this shouldn&#8217;t come as a shock to the offices affected. In fact, they may be pleased to hear it.

As long as they step carefully, data brokers can maintain what amounts to a shadow profile on consumers. I talked with director of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worldprivacyforum.org\/2018\/05\/privacy-news-historic-data-broker-regulation-in-the-us-welcome-by-world-privacy-forum\/\">World Privacy Forum<\/a>, Pam Dixon, about this practice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you use an actual credit score, it&#8217;s regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;But if you take a thousand points like shopping habits, zip code, housing status, you can create a new credit score; you can use that and it&#8217;s not discrimination.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And while medical data like blood tests are protected from snooping, it&#8217;s not against the law for a company to make an educated guess your condition from the medicine you pay for at the local pharmacy. Now you&#8217;re on a secret list of &#8220;inferred&#8221; diabetics, and that data gets sold to, for example, Facebook, which combines it with its own metrics and allows advertisers to target it.<\/p>\n<p>Oh yes, Facebook does that. Or did do it for years, only ending the practice under the present scrutiny. &#8220;When you looked at Facebook&#8217;s targeting there were like 90 targets &#8211; race, income, housing status \u2014 that was all Acxiom data,&#8221; Dixon told me; Acxiom is one of the largest brokers.<\/p>\n<p>Data brokers have been quietly supplying everyone with your personal information for a long time. And advertising is the least of its applications: this data is used for informing shadow credit scores, restricting services and offers to certain classes of people, setting terms of loans, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Vermont&#8217;s new law, which took effect late last week, is the nation&#8217;s first to address the data broker problem directly.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a huge oversight,&#8221; said Dixon. &#8220;Until Vermont passed this law there was no regulation for data brokers. It&#8217;s that serious. We&#8217;ve been looking for something like this to be put in place for like 20 years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Europe, meanwhile, has leapfrogged American regulators with the monumental GDPR, which just entered into effect.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Qd9XozvYPa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/20\/wtf-is-gdpr\/\">WTF is GDPR?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/20\/wtf-is-gdpr\/embed\/#?secret=Qd9XozvYPa\" data-secret=\"Qd9XozvYPa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;WTF is GDPR?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The issue, she said, has always been defining a data broker. It&#8217;s harder than you might think, considering how secretive and influential these companies are. When every company collects data on their customers and occasionally monetizes it, who&#8217;s to say where an ordinary business ends and data brokering begins?<\/p>\n<p>They fought previous laws, and they fought this one. But Dixon, who along with the companies themselves was part of the state&#8217;s hearings to create the law, said Vermont avoided this pitfall.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way the bill is written is extremely well thought through. They didn&#8217;t worry as much about the definition, but focused on the activity,&#8221; she explained. And indeed the directness and clarity of the law are a pleasant surprise:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>While data brokers offer many benefits, there are also risks associated with the widespread aggregation and sale of data about consumers, including risks related to consumers&#8217; ability to know and control information held and sold about them and risks arising from the unauthorized or harmful acquisition and use of consumer information.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers may not be aware that data brokers exist, who the companies are, or what information they collect, and may not be aware of available recourse.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This straightforward description of a subtle and widespread problem greatly enabled by technology is a rarity in a world dominated by legislators and judges who regularly demonstrate ignorance on high-tech topics. (You can read the full law <a href=\"https:\/\/legislature.vermont.gov\/assets\/Documents\/2018\/Docs\/BILLS\/H-0764\/H-0764%20As%20Passed%20by%20Both%20House%20and%20Senate%20Unofficial.pdf\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>As Dixon pointed out, lots of companies will find themselves encompassed by the law&#8217;s broad definition:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Data broker&#8221; means a business, or unit or units of a business, separately or together, that knowingly collects and sells or licenses to third parties the brokered personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, anyone who collects data second hand and resells it. There are a few exceptions for things like consumer-focused information services (411, for example) but it seems unlikely that any of the real brokers will escape the designation.<\/p>\n<p>With the requirement to register, along with a few other disclosures brokers will be required to make, consumers will be aware of which they can opt out of and how. And if they find themselves the victim of a crime that used broker data \u2014 a home loan rate secretly raised because of race, for instance, or a job offer rescinded because of a surreptitiously discovered medical condition \u2014 they have legal recourse.<\/p>\n<p>Security at these companies will have to meet a minimum standard, as well as access controls.

Starting June 3 and culminating in the TC Tel Aviv conference, we\u2019re organizing a series of events for the public focused on various technologies and startups highlighting mobility innovation in Israel and around the world.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/techcrunch-tel-aviv\/tel-aviv-innovation-week\/\">Click here to discover the full schedule of great events you can register for during Innovation Week.<\/a>\r\n\r\nIf you are an accredited journalist interested in covering this event, you can <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfW2gb12OMBkq2p0dansOMOy--d_QtRMFZr_wXW8JESY7e8iA\/viewform?usp=sf_link\">fill out this form<\/a><\/strong> to request a press pass.","image":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180607152709\/https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/telaviv_website_square_405x253.png","id":0,"link":"","name":"TechCrunch Tel Aviv","sanitized":"techcrunch-tel-aviv"}]}],"subPages":[{"id":1599520,"link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180607152709\/https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/techcrunch-tel-aviv\/sponsors\/","title":"Sponsors","type":"sponsors_page"},{"id":1617076,"link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180607152709\/https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/techcrunch-tel-aviv\/attendee-list\/","title":"Attendee List","type":"standard"},{"id":1623103,"link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180607152709\/https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/techcrunch-tel-aviv\/startup-alley\/","title":"Startup Alley","type":"standard"},{"id":1646014,"link":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180607152709\/https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/techcrunch-tel-aviv\/tel-aviv-innovation-week\/","title":"Tel Aviv Innovation Week","type":"standard"}],"ticketInfo":{"block_information":{"title":"Tickets","subtitle":"","display":true,"display_type":"widget","universe_id":"SN5BPH","thank_you_url":""},"offers":[{"title":"General Admission Ticket","subtitle":"","price":"\u20aa349.00","orig_price":"","price_details":"","description":"<p>Includes access to main session, workshops, &amp; closing reception.
