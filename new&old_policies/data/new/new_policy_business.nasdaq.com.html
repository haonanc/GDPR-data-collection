At your request, we will also inform you with which third parties we have shared your Personal Information.</div><ul><li><em>Right to object to processing.</em> You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Information based on our legitimate interest. If you object to such processing, we will only continue with the processing if we have a compelling legitimate reason for the processing that outweighs your interest, rights or freedoms, or if continued processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.</li><li><em>Right to portability.</em> You have the right to receive certain of your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller.
