TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h5>         <p>There are two main types of information we collect about users of the Services:</p>         <ul>           <li>             <strong>"Personally Identifiable Information"</strong> is information that identifies you and may include, for example,             your full (i.e., first and last) name, phone number, email address, postal address, credit or other payment card             number, and photos of you or other individuals.</li>           <li>             <strong>"Non-Personally Identifiable Information"</strong> is information that relates to you or the computer or mobile             device you use to access the online Services, but does not on its own identify you personally. This information             may include (for example), information about your use of the Services, including web pages you have visited,             apps you have downloaded, parts or functions of the Services you have used or viewed, gameplay data, content             you have accessed or viewed, advertising sent to you or that you have viewed, transaction history, IP address             and device identifiers, information about your Internet connection, information about the equipment or software             you use to access the Services, and information you provide to or post on message boards or chat rooms that are             part of the Services.           </li>         </ul>         <a class="page-anchor" id="how-we-collect-information"></a>         <h5>2. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM YOU</h5>         <p>We collect information about you in three main ways:</p>         <ul>           <li>             <strong>               <em>Directly from you, when you provide it to us:</em>             </strong> for example, when you register with the website, download an app, sign up for email or text alerts, buy movie             tickets or make other purchases via the Services, request products or services, respond to surveys, contact us             or otherwise interact with us. Please remember that if others use devices into which you remain logged in, they             may share information with us as if they were you, and they may have access to information that you have previously             provided us. To protect your privacy, please log out from the Services you use on shared devices.</li>           <li>             <strong>               <em>Automatically, when you use our Services</em>             </strong>: we collect information through the use of cookies and similar technologies, through logging your activities             on the Services, and when you download our applications. Please see our             <a href="/web/20180607215930/https://www.fandango.com/policies/cookies-and-tracking">Cookies and Tracking Technologies Information Center</a>, and             <a href="/web/20180607215930/https://www.fandango.com/mobileterms">Mobile Apps Information Center</a> for further information, including your choices in relation to the use of             these technologies. In addition, after you have provided us with your information, we may automatically associate             that information and other information that we collect with your account whenever you are logged-in so that we             can identify you across multiple devices and browsers. When you are not logged-in, we may automatically collect             information that can be used to recognize you across the devices you use. When you are using a Wi-Fi network             to which we have access, we may also detect and identify a device to which you have previously logged-in. Further,             Google may automatically obtain information from you when you use the Google Maps functionality in our Services             in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy. You agree that Google, and not Fandango, shall be responsible for             any of your information Google receives as a result of your use of Google Maps / Google Earth</li>           <li>             <strong>               <em>From third parties</em>             </strong>: we may obtain information about you from third parties outside of the Services. When you sign-on to the Services             or otherwise interact with social networks or if you interact with us through a social media function such as             a plug-in (for example, a Facebook "like" button) then you may be permitting us to have on-going access to some             information from your social network profile (such as your name, email address, your friend list, photo, age,             gender, location, birthday, social networking ID, current city, the people/sites you follow, and so forth). We             may also obtain information about you from a third party data aggregator, cookie technology operator, advertising             network, or another type of data company.</li>         </ul>         <a class="page-anchor" id="how-we-use-information"></a>         <h5>3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h5>         <p>We (and our service providers) may use the information we collect about you for a variety of business purposes.

We may also need to share information with other companies in order to enable the uses described above             in “How We Use Information About You” or elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Typically, when these companies are             provided with Personally Identifiable Information they are only provided with that Personally Identifiable Information             they need to perform their functions and that Personally Identifiable Information can only be used as is necessary             to perform the services on our behalf, or to comply with legal requirements.

In these instances, we may enhance the data they have about you by using             or sharing a common identifier that itself is not Personally Identifiable Information. When we share Non-Personally             Identifiable Information with these third party services, they may be able to match it with other information             that they separately receive about you.</li>           <li>             <strong>               <em>Theaters, Venue Operators, Event Promoters:</em>             </strong> We may provide information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to theaters, venue operators and event             promoters so that they can admit you to their premises (or to the premises of their events), or be prepared to             handle issues relating to your attendance or planned attendance.</li>           <li>             <strong>               <em>Loyalty Program Operators</em>:</strong> Our services offer the ability for consumers to link their Fandango             account with the loyalty rewards programs of certain theaters, venue operators, event promoters, movie studios             or other companies offering loyalty reward programs. When you indicate that you'd like such a link to occur,             we may share transaction information or other information (including Personally Identifiable Information) pertaining             to you with the applicable program operator.</li>           <li>             <strong>               <em>Social Networks:</em>             </strong> You may interact with certain features of the Services that cause information to be published to your social             networks.
