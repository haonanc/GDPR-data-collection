<p class="wysiwyg-indent2">Mobile versions of Scribd’s Websites may require that users log in with an account.  In such cases, information about use of each mobile version of the website may be associated with user accounts.  In addition, Scribd may enable Individuals to download an application, widget or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices.  Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices.  These tools may transmit Personal Information to Scribd to enable Data Subjects to access user accounts and to enable Scribd to track use of these tools.  Some of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool.  Scribd may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to the Company to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in other notices Scribd provides.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>2.12 Anonymous and Aggregated Information</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>3.0 Choice/Modalities to Opt Out</strong></h2>
<p>You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>3.1 General</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Where you have consented to Scribd’s Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out by following the instructions in this Section 3.  Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt out. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Prior to disclosing Sensitive Data to a Third Party or Processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the Data Subject, Scribd will endeavor to obtain each Data Subject’s explicit consent (opt-in).  Where consent of the Data Subject for the Processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, Scribd will comply with the law or contract.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>3.2 Email and Telephone Communications</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">An “Unsubscribe” button will be provided at the top or bottom of each email communications sent by Scribd so that you can opt-out.  However, we may continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested in response to such request.  We may need to send you certain communications regarding the Scribd programs and services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>3.3 Human Resources Data</strong></h3>

<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>3.4 “Do Not Track”</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.  DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.  Scribd does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.  For information about “do-not-track”, visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607220448/http://www.allaboutdnt.org/">http://www.allaboutdnt.org</a>.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>3.5 Advertising Choices</strong></h3>

<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Interest-based advertising is advertising that tries to make the ads you see more interesting and relevant to you based on the types of sites you visit online and other information that does not personally identify you.  Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites.  These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">You can opt out of the collection and use of your information for interest-based advertising by going to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607220448/http://optout.aboutads.info/">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>,  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607220448/http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607220448/http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a> to limit collection through the Website or by configuring the settings on your mobile device to limit ad tracking through the mobile applications.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Websites and/or information from the advertisements on Third-Party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>

<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">Scribd does not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy or as you explicitly consent.  Scribd endeavors to require third parties to which it discloses Personal Information to protect Personal Information using substantially similar standards to those required by Scribd (and at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles and this Privacy Policy), and to notify Scribd if they make a determination they can no longer meet this obligation.   </p>

<p class="wysiwyg-indent2"><em><u>4.1.2 Business Partners</u></em></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent2">Scribd may share Personal Information with our business partners, and affiliates for our and our affiliates’ internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested Scribd may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you.  In such cases, our business partner’s name will appear, along with Scribd’s.  Scribd requires our affiliates and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided.  </p>

<p class="wysiwyg-indent2">In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes – e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Websites.  In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent2"><em><u>4.1.4 Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</u></em></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent2">We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about you in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, any reorganization, sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of our business or of any of the business assets or shares (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding).  Should such an event occur, Scribd will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 class="wysiwyg-indent1"><strong>4.2 Data Transfers</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent1">All Personal Information sent or collected via or by Scribd may be stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, in the United States, in the cloud, our servers, the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers.  Your Personal Information may be accessible to law enforcement or other authorities pursuant to a lawful request.  By providing information to Scribd, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations. </p>
