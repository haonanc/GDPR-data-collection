<p><strong>Law Enforcement, Legal Process, and Emergency Situations</strong>. In some cases, we may use or disclose your personal information to a third party if we are required to do so by law or if we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process; to protect and defend our rights or to prevent misuse of our Services; or to protect the personal safety of our employees, agents, partners, the users of the Services, or the public.</p>
<p><strong>With Your Consent or At Your Direction</strong>. In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share your information with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.</p>
<p>The Services may link to third-party websites and services that are outside our control. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties, which operate pursuant to their respective privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong><u>ONLINE TRACKING</u></strong></p>
<p>When you use our Services, we and our third party partners (which provide content, advertising, functionality, measurements, or analytics for our Services) may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to track your use of the Services.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Cookies?<em>  </em></strong>Cookies are small text files that are stored in your device’s browser when you visit a website. Cookies make it possible to recognize you as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more websites.  We and third parties use cookies for a variety of purposes, including remembering your sign-in credentials and preferences so that you do not have to input them each time you use the Services; allowing us and third parties to customize your experience using the Services, including by determining the most relevant content and advertisements to show you on our websites and elsewhere online; and allowing us and third parties to monitor site traffic and performance, so that we may improve our Services and your experience.</p>
<p><strong>What are Beacons?</strong>  Web beacons (also called “web tags” or “pixels”) are tiny graphics or scripts that communicate information from your device to a server.  Beacons can be embedded in online or mobile content, videos, advertisements, or emails.  They allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, such as when you viewed the beacon (and thus the content in which it is embedded) and the IP address of the device on which you viewed the beacon.  We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</p>
<p><strong><u>THIRD PARTIES</u></strong></p>
<p>We rely on third parties to provide many features of our Services using data about your use of our Services and of other websites.  These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, or other technologies to collect and process your personal data for the purposes of information storage and access; personalization of our Services; measurement of and analytics regarding the use of our Services; content selection, delivery, and reporting; and advertising selection, targeting, delivery, and reporting.</p>
<p>For instance, third party analytics services use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website, in order to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Services, compile reports on the Services’ activity, and provide other data and insights related to the Services’ usage.</p>
<p>We also allow our third party partners, third party ad serving networks, and unaffiliated advertisers (collectively, “Advertisers”) to use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to provide ads about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Advertisers may place a separate cookie on your computer, mobile device, or browser, or utilize other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as your IP address, browser type, server being used, area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you respond to particular ads. Advertisers may collect information about your online activities over time, across different computers, devices, and browsers, and across different websites and other online services.  Advertisers may use this information to provide interest-based advertising or other targeted content.</p>
<p>We will not provide Advertisers with access to your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number without your consent.  Advertisers may use persistent identifiers, however, to track your internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond our Services.  Though we restrict any attempts to re-identify this information, Advertisers may nonetheless be able to do so by combining information they collect about you when you use the Services with information about you obtained from other sources.</p>
<p>In general, the information collected and generated by third parties is processed and stored by the third parties and will be subject to their respective privacy policies (which we do not control and for which we are not responsible).  We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or the information they may collect.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the third party data processing partners with which we have a direct relationship, grouped by the type of data processing they provide to us and linked to their respective privacy policies (which may provide more information about their use of your data and how to exercise your rights to opt-out of that usage).  Please note that this list does <em>not</em> include advertisers (with whom we have no direct relationship) who advertise on our websites through ad serving networks.  This list was last updated on May 28, 2018; because our Services are under constant development, it may be modified and updated on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>The Services may deliver advertising using the vendor DoubleClick, a Google company. You can read about how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607184910/https://support.google.com/dcm/partner/answer/2839090?hl=en">DoubleClick uses cookies</a>, use Google’s controls for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607184910/https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2662922#stop_goog_p13n">blocking certain ads</a>, or use Google’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607184910/https://adssettings.google.com/">Ad Settings Page</a> to control how DoubleClick personalizes your ad experience.</p>

<p>Please note that opting-out of advertising networks’ tracking and targeting does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Services or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs.  It will exclude you, however, from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track. </strong>Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality.  Because a “Do Not Track” compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Quartz’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.</p>
<p><strong><u>USERS IN THE EEA AND SWITZERLAND </u></strong></p>
<p><em>If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland (an “EEA User”), the following information applies with respect to personal data collected through your use of our Services. </em></p>
<p><strong>Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing</strong>: We process personal data consistent with our disclosures in this Privacy Policy. We process personal data on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Services; and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing the Services where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms related to data privacy.</p>
<p>All EEA Users of qz.com (including quartzy.qz.com, work.qz.com, and any other qz.com domain or sub-domain) will see a personal data processing disclosure and consent interface (a persistent banner at the bottom of the screen) upon every visit to the websites, until and unless the user selects either “Yes” or “No” in the interface.  <strong><em>Only those EEA Users who have selected “Yes” in this interface will have their personal data processed by Quartz for the purpose of ad targeting, selection, and delivery</em></strong>.  For any EEA User who either selects “No” or does not make a selection, Quartz will only serve non-personalized and non-programmatic advertising, which may be targeted using coarse location.</p>
<p>Quartz’s mobile app, email communications, and other non-website Services do <u>not</u> process personal data for the purposes of ad targeting, selection, and delivery (either within or outside the Services).</p>
<p><strong>Transfers</strong>: Personal data we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or processors maintain facilities. We will ensure that transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization are subject to appropriate safeguards.  <strong>Our </strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607184910/http://www.atlanticmedia.com/privacyshield/">Privacy Shield Policy</a><strong> governs use of personal information that has been transferred to us from organizations in the EEA and Switzerland</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Your Rights</strong>: You are entitled to the rights under Chapter III of the EU General Data Protection Regulation or Section 2 of the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection with respect to the processing of your personal data, which include the right to access and rectify and to request erasure of personal data. <strong>To exercise these rights, contact Privacy(at)QZ(dot)com and provide as complete a description of your request as possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>How Your Information Is Secured</strong>.  We take reasonable security measures to protect your information, including the use of physical, technical and administrative controls.  Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  You need to help protect the privacy of your own information. You must take precautions to protect the security of any personal information that you may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personal information. You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks.</p>
<p><strong>How Long Your Information Is Stored.  </strong>The time period for which we keep information varies according to the purpose for which it is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.</p>
<p><strong>Emails and Newsletters</strong>.  You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail marketing messages and newsletters from Quartz by following the instructions contained within the emails and newsletters, or by e-mailing, calling or writing us at the addresses in the “Questions” section of the Privacy Policy below.</p>
<p><strong>Contests, Sweepstakes or Games.</strong>  When we run a contest, sweepstakes, or game relating to the Services, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest, sweepstakes or game will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this privacy policy.  In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it.</p>
<p><strong>Children’s Information</strong>.  The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age.  Quartz does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, do not provide personal information to Quartz without providing us with consent from your parents. If Quartz discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided Quartz with personal information and we do not have parental consent, Quartz will immediately delete that child’s information. If you believe that company has been provided with the personal information of a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, please notify us immediately at Privacy(at)QZ(dot)com.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong>  Quartz does not disclose your personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosures.</p>

We publish bracingly creative and intelligent journalism with a broad worldview, built primarily for the devices closest at hand: tablets and mobile phones.<\/p>\n<p>Like Wired in the 1990s and The Economist in the 1840s, Quartz embodies the era in which it is being created. The financial crisis that recently engulfed much of the world wasn&#8217;t just a cyclical decline or a correction or even a bubble bursting. It was a breaking point. And its shockwaves exposed a fundamentally changed economic order with new leaders and ways of doing business.<\/p>\n<p>Our coverage of this new global economy is rooted in a set of defining obsessions: core topics and knotty questions of seismic importance to business professionals. These are the issues that energize our newsroom, and we invite you to obsess about them along with us. You can always reach us by emailing <a title=\"hi@qz.com\" href=\"mailto:hi@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hi@qz.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Quartz\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/qz.com\/about\/meet-the-staff\/\">founding team<\/a> includes veterans of some of the world&#8217;s highest-quality news organizations who have reported in 115 countries and speak 19 languages. Our main office is in New York City, and we have correspondents and staff reporters in London, Paris, Indonesia, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. We expect to expand quickly to other locations.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also a nerdy bunch, embracing the opportunity to create a newsroom that is wholly focused on digital storytelling. We view the creation of Quartz as just the beginning of an ongoing process in discovering the best ways to report and deliver information online. Developers and journalists, sometimes one-and-the-same, sit next to each other in the Quartz newsroom as we continually iterate and experiment. We know that the future of news will be written in code.<\/p>\n<p>As we build Quartz, we are focused on the touchscreen and mobile devices that increasingly dominate our lives. Our design began with the iPad foremost in mind, and we modified it from there to suit smartphones and, finally, personal computers. Your experience with Quartz should befit the hardware you visit us with and shift as seamlessly as you do from phone to tablet to laptop and back again. Call us a website or, if you like, a web app: Quartz combines the benefits of the free and open Web with the elegance of an application.<\/p>\n<p>In all that we do at Quartz, we embrace openness: open source code, an open newsroom, and open access to the data behind our journalism. We&#8217;ll try to be as transparent with you as possible about the decisions we make and where we are headed.

Here is an outline of Quartz&#8217;s business model and the measures it takes to maintain its integrity:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quartz is wholly owned by the Atlantic Media Company, a privately held American corporation with holdings in media and marketing services.<\/li>\n<li>It derives its principal income from companies that advertise on the Quartz website and underwrite Quartz events.<\/li>\n<li>It does not take payments of any kind in return for coverage.<\/li>\n<li>It does not have shareholders, investors or other financial backers other than the Atlantic Media Company.<\/li>\n<li>It does not have investments in other companies or projects.<\/li>\n<li>It does not adjust its editorial content to advertisers&#8217; wishes, nor to avoid covering subjects that may be sensitive for advertisers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition, Quartz&#8217;s journalists:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>are governed by a strict conflict-of-interest policy on personal financial activity.<\/li>\n<li>have no involvement in the creation of advertising content.<\/li>\n<li>do not accept paid trips or gifts (above a nominal value) that might influence their coverage. The one exception to this rule is for travel coverage, when the trip itself is being reviewed and would be too expensive for us to cover otherwise. In such cases, the fact that the trip was paid for will be disclosed on the same page as the coverage.<\/li>\n<li>do not accept payment to speak at events where this could pose a conflict of interest, such as at a dinner hosted by a company they normally cover.<\/li>\n<li>may accept travel costs and speaking fees for events such as conferences, where this does not pose a conflict of interest. If they write about anything related to the event, the fact that they were paid will be disclosed on the same page as the coverage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">E-Commerce Guidelines<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>When we link to an e-commerce site and you make a purchase on that site, we sometimes receive a small cut of the revenue. This is a tiny source of revenue for Quartz right now, but we hope it will grow to help fund our ambitious journalism. The commercial relationships with e-commerce sites are handled by a third-party company called Skimlinks; our journalists are not involved. Our policy for links is always to point readers to the best and most useful resources. We don\u2019t let any monetary incentives influence our choices, and the journalists who select the links in their articles aren\u2019t aware of which sites might generate revenue for Quartz.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><b><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Advertising Guidelines<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>These Guidelines set forth standards that govern <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s relationship with its advertising partners and the relationship between editorial and advertising content. The overriding consideration is that <i>Quartz<\/i> must maintain its editorial integrity and the trust of its readers. We believe that establishing, publicly displaying, and adhering to these Guidelines is important to protect the trust and transparency that should exist between a publication, its readers, and its advertisers.<\/p>\n<p>We also recognize that no set of Guidelines can address every situation or issue that may arise in the course of doing business, especially given the pace of change within the media industry.  Accordingly, we anticipate that these guidelines will be revisited and updated from time to time. In particular, we will remain teachable and open to suggestions, criticism, and correction from our readers and other interested parties.<\/p>\n<p><b>General Advertising Guidelines<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Guidelines in the following section apply to all advertisements and sponsor content served by or appearing in the print and digital publications of <i>Quartz<\/i> and its affiliates (hereinafter \u201c<i>Quartz<\/i>\u201d), including ads purchased under AAAA\/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quartz will not allow any relationship with an advertiser to compromise <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s editorial integrity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>All advertising content must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.  To that end, <i>Quartz<\/i> will label an advertisement with the word \u201cAdvertisement\u201d when, in its opinion, this is necessary to make clear the distinction between editorial material and advertising.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that their ads are adequately substantiated and comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. While the content of advertising does not reflect the views of <i>Quartz<\/i> or its editors\u2014if it comes to the attention of <i>Quartz<\/i> that an ad, in our opinion, contains demonstrably false or unlawful content, <i>Quartz<\/i> will refuse or remove the ad in whole or in part.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Quartz<\/i> may exercise its discretion to refuse or remove any advertising that is inconsistent with or may tend to bring disparagement, harm to reputation, or other damage to <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Although <i>Quartz<\/i> will evaluate whether to work with advertisers on a case-by-case basis, some examples of advertising <i>Quartz<\/i> will not accept are the following:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Advertising that <i>Quartz<\/i> believes, in its opinion, is indecent, vulgar, suggestive, profane, or offensive.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising for illegal products or services, including drugs, illegal substances, or any related products or services.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising that <i>Quartz<\/i> believes includes hateful or violent text advocating against any individual, group, or organization.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising that <i>Quartz<\/i> determines to be inflammatory.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising that <i>Quartz<\/i> determines represents a personal attack against an individual, country, or organization.<\/li>\n<li>Advertising that <i>Quartz<\/i> believes will undermine the intellectual integrity, authority, and character of its mission and brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All determinations of the application of the foregoing standards to particular advertisements or advertisers shall be within the sole discretion of <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s business-side staff. <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s editors will not be involved in deciding whether to accept or reject specific advertisers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>All advertising agreements or contracts must include the standard terms and conditions from <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s Insertion Order, which will supersede any Agreement between <i>Quartz<\/i> and its advertisers, including the AAAA\/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions.  Moreover, <i>Quartz<\/i> may remove advertising content at any time if such content is inconsistent with the policies described herein, with or without prior notice to the advertising client and regardless of whether the advertising content has been accepted or displayed within <i>Quartz<\/i> for any period of time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><b> Sponsor Content Guidelines<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The guidelines in the following section shall apply to all Sponsor Content served by or appearing in the digital publications of <i>Quartz<\/i>, including ads purchased under AAAA\/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions. (These are in addition to the general guidelines for advertising content that appear above, which apply to Sponsor Content as well.)<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sponsor Content is content created by or expressly on behalf of advertisers in conjunction with <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s marketing team (\u201cQuartz Marketing\u201d). <i>Quartz<\/i> allows Sponsor Content in two forms:  (1) Content produced by Quartz Marketing on behalf of its advertising partners and (2) Content produced by advertisers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>As with all advertising, Sponsor Content does not necessarily reflect the views and choices of <i>Quartz<\/i> or its editors. Accordingly, <i>Quartz<\/i> will prominently display the following disclaimer on all Sponsor Content:  \u2018SPONSOR CONTENT.\u2019  <i>Quartz<\/i> will additionally include the following disclaimer on all Sponsor Content:  \u2018<i>This article is written by\/on behalf of brand X and not by Quartz editorial staff\u2019<\/i> <i>Quartz<\/i> may additionally include, in certain areas and platforms, further explanation defining Sponsor Content to <i>Quartz<\/i> readers. In addition, <i>Quartz<\/i> will ensure the treatment and design of Advertising and Sponsor Content is clearly differentiated from its editorial content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Quartz<\/i> does not require that Sponsor Content steer clear of controversy.  Indeed, we expect that Sponsor Content, like our own editorial content, will sometimes address contested issues and will be written with a distinct point of view. That said, even with the caveat that Sponsor Content does not necessarily reflect the views of <i>Quartz<\/i> or its editors, <i>Quartz<\/i> will refuse publication of such content that, in its own judgment, would undermine the intellectual integrity, authority, and character of our enterprise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>As with all advertising, and consistent with the foregoing General Advertising Guidelines, <i>Quartz<\/i> may reject or remove any Sponsor Content at any time that contains false, deceptive, potentially misleading, or illegal content; is inconsistent with or may tend to bring disparagement, harm to reputation, or other damage to <i>Quartz<\/i>\u2019s brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","postType":"page","url":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180607184910\/https:\/\/qz.com\/about\/ethicsandadvertisingguidelines\/","slug":"ethicsandadvertisingguidelines"},{"id":3451,"title":"Privacy Policy","content":"<p><strong><em>Last Updated: May 29, 2018<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Quartz Media LLC (\u201cQuartz\u201d) wants you to enjoy our websites, apps, and other online services secure in the knowledge that we have implemented fair and transparent information practices designed to protect, and provide you with control of, your privacy.<\/p>\n<p>Quartz owns and operates public-facing websites (including qz.com, quartzy.qz.com, work.qz.com); operates Facebook pages, groups, and bots; delivers newsletters and other content via email; and makes the same or similar content available to mobile users, including via iOS and Android apps (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d).

Advertisers may place a separate cookie on your computer, mobile device, or browser, or utilize other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as your IP address, browser type, server being used, area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you respond to particular ads. Advertisers may collect information about your online activities over time, across different computers, devices, and browsers, and across different websites and other online services.  Advertisers may use this information to provide interest-based advertising or other targeted content.<\/p>\n<p>We will not provide Advertisers with access to your name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number without your consent.  Advertisers may use persistent identifiers, however, to track your internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond our Services.  Though we restrict any attempts to re-identify this information, Advertisers may nonetheless be able to do so by combining information they collect about you when you use the Services with information about you obtained from other sources.<\/p>\n<p>In general, the information collected and generated by third parties is processed and stored by the third parties and will be subject to their respective privacy policies (which we do not control and for which we are not responsible).  We do not control these third parties\u2019 tracking technologies or the information they may collect.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a list of the third party data processing partners with which we have a direct relationship, grouped by the type of data processing they provide to us and linked to their respective privacy policies (which may provide more information about their use of your data and how to exercise your rights to opt-out of that usage).  Please note that this list does <em>not<\/em> include advertisers (with whom we have no direct relationship) who advertise on our websites through ad serving networks.
