<h2 class="collapsible-trigger">Privacy Policy</h2>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Our Web site links to other National Institutes of Health (NIH) sites, federal agency sites and occasionally, to private organizations. Once you leave the primary NIH.gov site, you are subject to the privacy policy for the site(s) you are visiting. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) about you during your visit to NIH Web sites unless you choose to provide it to us. We do, however, collect some data about your visit to our Web site to help us better understand how the public uses the site and how to make it more helpful. We collect information from visitors who read, browse, and/or download information from our Web site. NIH never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to the NIH mission and goals.</p>
<p>When visitors submit questions or comments via the <a href="/web/20180607140106/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/ask-nih">Ask NIH</a> online form, NIH staff responds to the inquiries and files them. Only designated staff members requiring access to the emails to respond, may view, or answer them.</p>
<h3 class="collapsible-trigger">Types of Information Collected</h3>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>When you browse through any Web site, certain information about your visit can be collected. We automatically collect and temporarily store the following type of information about your visit:</p>
<ul><li>Domain from which you access the Internet;</li>
<li>IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when surfing the Web);</li>
<li>Operating system and information about the browser used when visiting the site;</li>
<li>Date and time of your visit;</li>
<li>Pages you visited;</li>
<li>Address of the Web site that connected you to an NIH Web site (such as google.com or bing.com); and,</li>
<li>Demographic and interest data.</li>
</ul><p>We use this information to measure the number of visitors to our site and its various sections and to help make our site more useful to visitors. This information cannot be used to identify you as an individual.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="collapsible-trigger">How NIH Collects Information</h3>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>NIH.gov uses Google Analytics to collect the information in the bulleted list in the <em>Types of Information Collected</em> section above. Google Analytics gathers information automatically and continuously. No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected. NIH staff conducts analyses and reports on the aggregated data from Google Analytics and those reports are only available to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov communications and web teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.</p>
<p>Additionally, NIH.gov participates in the Digital Analytics Program (DAP), in which Google Analytics data is collected from websites across the Federal Government. For more information on DAP, please visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607140106/https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/">DigitalGov website</a>.</p>
<p>NIH also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors. NIH.gov uses the ForeSee Results’ American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with the NIH.gov website. This survey does not collect PII. Although the survey invitation pops up for a random sample of visitors, it is optional. If you decline the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources at the NIH.gov site as those who do not take the survey. The survey reports are available only to NIH.gov managers, members of the NIH.gov Communications and Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.</p>
<p>NIH retains the data from Google Analytics, and ACSI survey results as long as needed to support the mission of the NIH.gov website.</p>

<h3 class="collapsible-trigger">How NIH Uses Cookies</h3>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>The Office of Management and Budget Memo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607140106/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-22.pdf">M-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies</a> allows Federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.</p>
<p>When you visit any Web site, its server may generate a piece of text known as a "cookie" to place on your computer. The cookie allows the server to "remember" specific information about your visit while you are connected.</p>
<p>The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of Web pages. Cookies from NIH Web pages only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect personal information about you.</p>
<p>There are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.</p>
<h4>Session Cookies</h4>
<p>We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as "Usage Tier 1 — Single Session.” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies."</p>
<h4>Persistent Cookies</h4>
<p>We use persistent cookies to enable Webtrends and Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning NIH.gov visitors. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to NIH.gov until they expire. We also use persistent cookies to <a href="/web/20180607140106/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/persistent-cookies-american-customer-satisfaction-index">block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey</a>. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as "Usage Tier 2 — Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, "This tier encompasses any use of multi-session Web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected."</p>
</div>
<h3 class="collapsible-trigger">How to Opt Out or Disable Cookies</h3>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies placed on your computer, you can disable them using your Web browser. If you opt out of cookies, you will still have access to all information and resources at NIH.gov.

<h3 class="collapsible-trigger">How NIH.gov uses Third-Party Web sites and Applications</h3>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>As part of the OMB Memo <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607140106/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-06.pdf">M-10-06, Open Government Directive</a>, the NIH uses a variety of new technologies and social media options to communicate and interact with citizens. These sites and applications include popular social networking and media sites, open source software communities and more. TPWAs are Web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by NIH, such as applications not hosted on a.gov domain or those that are embedded on NIH Web pages. Users of TPWAs often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the Web site. These actors may use this information in a variety of ways. TPWAs could cause PII to become available or accessible to NIH and the public, regardless of whether the information is explicitly solicited or collected by NIH.</p>
<p>The following list includes some of the TPWAs we use and their purpose. NIH sometimes collects and uses PII made available through third-party Web sites. However, we do not share PII made available through third-party Web sites. Your activity on the third-party Web sites we use is governed by the security and privacy policy of those sites, which we have linked below. You should review the third-party privacy policies before using the sites and ensure that you understand how your information may be used. If you have an account with a third-party Web site, and choose to follow, like, friend, or comment, certain PII associated with your account may be made available to NIH based on the privacy policy of the third-party Web site and your privacy settings within that third-party Web site. Therefore, you should also adjust privacy settings on your account to match your preferences.</p>
<p>For any NIH TPWA that collects PII, the list below also includes details on the information NIH collects and how we will protect your private information.</p>

NIH Facebook pages are managed by NIH staff members who post news and other items of interest to be consumed by the public. If you have a Facebook account, you can log in to your account to post comments, and 'like' NIH Facebook pages and individual entries. If once you click on an NIH Facebook page, you comment or click on the 'like' button, your PII will be visible to NIH staff and other Facebook site visitors. The amount of visible personal information displayed will depend on your own Facebook privacy settings. You can completely avoid displaying any PII by not creating a Facebook account, not posting comments, not clicking on the 'like' options, or interacting with NIH Facebook accounts in any way (i.e., private messaging, sharing NIH posts, etc.). NIH staff do not collect, use or disclose any information about visitors who comment or 'like' the NIH Facebook sites. However, as a practice, comment moderator policy requires the removal from NIH Facebook pages of any comments that contain spam or are improper, inflammatory, off-topic or offensive. Repeat offenders may be subject to banning. The information is then saved on a password-protected shared drive accessible to NIH Managers, System Owners, Communications Staff, Web Teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.

<h4 class="collapsible-trigger">Polldaddy</h4>
<div class="collapsible-content">
<p>NIH uses Polldaddy in conjunction with some NIH WordPress blogs to collect your click-opinions or rankings of drop-down menu preferences as a blog participant. Polldaddy is the only survey tool that is compatible with WordPress and most Polldaddy surveys are embedded within blog entries on NIH WordPress blogs. However, there are links to the Polldaddy site at the bottom of the survey form. You can vote on a topic using the Polldaddy form embedded on a NIH blog. However, to submit a comment, you must navigate directly to the Polldaddy site, provide your name, and e-mail address. Polldaddy automatically scans your comments prior to posting them to determine whether they are spam and, if so, deletes them. If the submission is not recognized as spam by the Polldaddy filtering program, the comment is immediately posted to the poll results published on the Polldaddy site. Considering the comments provided could potentially contain PII, any such unsolicited PII will not be posted on NIH blogs. Any information collected by NIH is de-identified and will be used solely for the purpose of engaging participants and gaining insight into public opinions. Comments will be viewable on the Polldaddy site.
