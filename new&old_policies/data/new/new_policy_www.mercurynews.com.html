Such Personal Information may be collected, for example, when you submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Platform, send us an e-mail, sign up for an e-mail newsletter or newsletters, text or mobile alerts, or in any other way submit information to us via our Platform.In addition to collecting Personal Information from users such as names and contact details, we also collect Non-Personal Information. “Non-Personal Information” refers to information that may not be itself be reasonably associated with, linked to, or used to identify you.

<li><u>Other Information We Collect</u>
<ol type="i">
<li>Cookies: We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer’s hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase. They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and password. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you. These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.<br/>
You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Policy.Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of our Web Site.</li>
<li>Clear GIFs: We may use “clear GIFs” (a/k/a “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on our Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you.</li>
<li>IP Address and Clickstream Data: Pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet. When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Site; the web site you visit after our Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.</li>
<li>Device Information: We may collect certain device information. Device information may include, for example: the type of device you are using (e.g., your particular brand of phone or tablet), certain device identifiers which may be unique to your device, your Internet service provider, and depending on your permissions, content you have stored on your device (e.g. contacts stored on your phone).</li>
</ol>

Except as otherwise stated in the Terms of Use, upon termination or expiration of the Terms of Use for any reason: (a) all rights granted to you under the Terms of Use will terminate; and (b) you will immediately cease all use of and access to the Platform, and all Content and Services (including, without limitation, all Content you obtained prior to termination). All sections that by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration of the Terms of Use will survive.</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous: </strong>Unless you later enter into any other agreements with Digital First Media regarding the Platform, Content, or Services, the Terms of Use is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and Digital First Media regarding your access to and use of the Platform, Content, and Services. This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Digital First Media and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals and communications, written and oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use specific services on the Platform, or the products or services of a third party that are provided through the Platform. Except as expressly set forth in the Terms of Use, the Terms of Use may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both parties. All waivers by Digital First Media under the Terms of Use must be in writing or later acknowledged by Digital First Media in writing. Any waiver or failure by Digital First Media to enforce any provision of the Terms of Use on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver by Digital First Media of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of the Terms of Use is held to be unenforceable, that provision will be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law, replaced by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to the extent consistent with the law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. The prevailing party in any lawsuit or proceeding arising from or related to the Terms of Use will be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, including costs and fees on appeal. Neither the Terms of Use nor any rights or obligations of you hereunder may be assigned or transferred by you (in whole or in part and including by sale, merger, consolidation, or other operation of law) without the prior written approval of Digital First Media. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Digital First Media may assign the Terms of Use to any party that assumes Digital First Media’s obligations hereunder. The parties hereto are independent parties, not agents, employees or employers of the other or joint venturers, and neither acquires hereunder any right or ability to bind or enter into any obligation on behalf of the other. Any reference herein to “including” will mean “including, without limitation.”
