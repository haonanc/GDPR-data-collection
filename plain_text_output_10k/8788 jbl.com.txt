Effective Date: May 1, 2018
This Privacy Statement describes how we use and disclose the information that we collect from you when you visit our website, products, applications, or services that references this Privacy Statement (collectively, the “Services”). Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional policies may apply. These additional policies will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional policies become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.
For the purposes of applicable EU data protection laws and unless otherwise stated, Harman is the data controller and is responsible for the collection and use of your Personal Data.
This Privacy Statement is incorporated into our Terms of Use at https://www.harman.com/terms-use. Please read both documents carefully, as they contain important information about your use of the Services. If you do not understand our Privacy Statement or our Terms of Use, please contact us using the information below.
KEY DEFINITIONS
“Aggregate Information” is information that has been combined with information about other users and analyzed or evaluated as a whole, such that no specific individual may be reasonably identified. For example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that says “50% of our users have used the mobile app in the last month”.
“Cookies” are text files, typically small in size, that are placed on your computer by a webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
“Personal Data” is any information that can be used to identify you, either alone or in combination with other information. Personal Data does not include Aggregate Information or other anonymized information (including metadata) collected by Harman that cannot be used to identify you, even if such information was derived from your Personal Data.
“Usage Data” is information about how you use the Services, such as your browser type, domains, page views, duration, and information about the device you use to access the Services.
“Web Beacons” (also known as “Clear GIFs” and “Pixel Tags”) are small bits of code embedded in web pages or in emails that are used to monitor the behavior of a website user or recipient of an email.

Location information. We may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors. For example, if our Service can provide driving direction, traffic reporting, recommendation of establishments near your location, and similar services, then we may collect your device’s real-time or compiled geographical information in order to provide such Service to you.
Unique application numbers. Certain Services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to us at the time of installation or update.
Information we collect when you are signed in to our Services may be associated with your account. When information is associated with your account, we treat it as personal information.
In addition to the purposes listed above, we may also use your Personal Data to:
Communicate with you. Obtain your name for purposes of communicating with you and identifying you as a user of the website or product.
Verify your identity. We may use your Personal Data to verify who you are. For example, we may verify your age or that you have obtained your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the website or product.
Send you marketing materials. We may send you marketing materials, such as promotional emails or catalogues, to keep you informed of our upcoming product releases. You generally must opt-in to receiving our marketing materials, and you may opt out of receiving them at any time. For more information on how to opt out, please see YOUR CHOICES below.
Respond to your questions and fulfill your requests. We may send you communications upon your request or otherwise with your consent.

We also gather non-descriptive, non-identifiable statistical information about how many visitors use our Services, how our users use the Services, how our users access certain content available on our Services, how long our users access certain content, what content our users are accessing, and our user preferences or settings for certain Services. We use this Aggregated Information for statistical analysis of how users make use of the Services so we can better improve our Services. 
DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES
We use Cookies, Web Beacons, and other data collection technologies (together, “Data Collection Technologies”) to provide you with a better experience when you use the Services. Data Collection Technologies help you log onto the Services, remember your settings and preferences, help us keep your information safe and secure, and enable our partners to serve ads for our products and services, including those targeted to your interests. While the Data Collection Technologies we use may change from time to time, they generally fall into the following categories:
Authentication. We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you’re logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Services and show you the appropriate experience and features.
Security and product integrity. We use cookies to help us keep your account and information safe and secure. We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide our Services.
Advertising, insights and measurement. We use cookies to help us show ads for businesses and other organizations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote. We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Services. Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.
Site features and services. We use cookies to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Services and provide you with the best experience possible, including to help provide you with content relevant to your locale.
Analytics and research: We use Cookies to better understand how people use the website so that we can improve the Services. For example, we partner with Google Analytics, which uses Cookies to track your interactions with our Services. Google then collects that information and reports it to us, without identifying individual users. This information helps us improve our Services so that we can better serve users like you. For more information on Google Analytics, visit https://support.google.com/analytics .
Although most browsers and devices accept Cookies and other Data Collection Technologies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear or decline Cookies. If you disable Cookies, some of the features of our Services may not be available or function properly.
Interest Based Advertising: We may use vendors to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These advertising vendors may collect (through the use of Data Collection Technologies) non-identifiable information about your visits to and interactions with our Services. In addition, our vendors may also use the information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from us. If you would like more information about this practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ .
Please note: Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature (DNT) that signals to the websites that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Many websites and applications, including our Services, do not currently respond to web browser DNT signals because such signals are not yet uniform. For more information about DNT signals, please visit http://allaboutdnt.com .
