Teacher Profiles
If you are a Teacher, the Personal Data you provide on your Profile, including your profile photo, is made public by default on the Site, Apps and Services and is viewable by other Teachers.
By default, messages that you post to your Newsfeed, as well the names of users you are Following and users who are Following you, are public and viewable by other Teachers. However, you have the option to make your Newsfeed private through the privacy settings on your Account. If you choose to make your Newsfeed private, it will be viewable to only those users who are Following you.
Once displayed publicly, the information you post in your Profile and Newsfeed can be collected and used by others. We cannot control who reads your Newsfeed, postings or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you exercise caution with respect to any Personal Data that you include in your posts. Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Site or App, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).

Security of Your Personal Data
We have implemented a variety of security measures to protect the Personal Data we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We protect your login information and the transmission of data using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.

COPPA Privacy Policy
Showbie Inc. ("Socrative") values the privacy of children and of all of its users. This COPPA Privacy Policy ("COPPA Policy") is designed to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and contains important information about how we collect, use, and disclose the personal information we collect from children under thirteen years old who use our website, www.socrative.com (the "Site"), our mobile applications (the "Apps"), and the services available through our Site and Apps (collectively, the "Services"). This COPPA Policy also explains how a parent or guardian (“parent” or “you”) can restrict the collection, use and/or disclosure of your Child’s (as defined below) information and how you can request deletion of your Child’s information.
The Socrative Services are a classroom tool and resource that teacher end users (“Teachers”) can use as part of their classroom activities to identify levels of student understanding around their instruction on a real-time basis. To use the Services, Teachers may collect personal information from their students, including children who are under 13 years old (“Students”). For the purposes of this Policy, "Child" or "Children" means a Student under 13 years old.
When a Teacher uses our Services in the classroom or an educational setting, such as to sign Students up for the Services, or to assign response activities to Students and track their progress, the Teacher is required to provide consent to the collection and use of personal information from and about Children as required under applicable laws, including but not limited to COPPA and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). Teachers and the schools or other academic institutions with which the Teachers and the Teachers’ Students are affiliated (“Schools”) are also responsible for providing parents with notice about how personal information from their Child(ren) is collected and used by us.
Children's personal information will be handled only as described in this COPPA Policy. Any personal information we collect about other users (e.g., Students over 13 years old, Teachers, and parents) will be treated in accordance with the Socrative Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy").
Who Will Collect Information About Children?
Showbie Inc. operates the Site, Apps, and Services and will collect Children’s personal information as described in this COPPA Policy. We can be contacted at:
Showbie
What Information Do We Collect About Children?
How Information is Collected. We may collect information about Children directly from Children and/or their Teachers, as well as automatically through a Child's use of our Site, Apps, and/or Services. We will not require a Child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to use our Services. Further, as explained below, we will not collect a Child’s name, contact information, or other personal information directly unless a Teacher or School requests it. We provide Teachers and Schools with a notice regarding our privacy practices.
Information We Collect Directly. Socrative does not require Children to submit name, contact information, or other personal information to us to register for our Site, Apps or Services. To log on to the Services, Children are prompted to enter either a unique and anonymous assessment ID, which will be provided to the Student by a Teacher, and/or a unique and anonymous student ID generated either by the School or by Socrative.
We may collect a Child's name and other limited personal information directly from a Child's Teacher or School. Through our Services, Teachers can create assessments and track their Students’ learning progress. In doing so, Teachers may require the Child’s personal information in order to track and archive evidence of learning. Teachers are responsible for ensuring that their collection and use of personal information from Children complies with applicable laws, including COPPA and FERPA. If you are a parent and you have questions about your Child's Teacher's use of our Services and any information collected, you should discuss your questions with your child's Teacher or School.
A Teacher has the option of creating an account on behalf of their Students which allows those Students to view their learning progress and access learning resources provided by their Teacher. If a Teacher chooses to register a Child for an account, Socrative will generate a user name and temporary password and provide directly to the Teacher who may then share with the Child. The only information we collect directly from the Child is a permanent password for their account.
We collect information about Children's performance and activities on our Site, Apps, and Services, including the assessments taken, questions answered, and other evidence of learning. This information is made available to Teachers in personally identifiable form; we do not use this information in personally identifiable form for our own commercial purposes. If we analyze or use any activity data for our own commercial purposes, we will de-identify and/or aggregate such information.
Parents can tell us to stop collecting personal information from their Child(ren); however, in such cases the Child(ren) will not be able to use our Services, as they are intended to be controlled by a Teacher. If you direct us to stop collecting and using your Child's personal information, we must disable his or her use of our Services to ensure that no information is collected via the Teacher's use of Socrative as a classroom tool.
Information We Collect Automatically. We may automatically collect the following information about a Child’s use of our Site, Apps, or Services through our servers and in log files: domain name; browser type and operating system; web pages viewed; links clicked; the length of time spent on our Site or Apps; the length of time our Services are used; the referring URL, or the webpage that led a user to our Site; language information; device name and model; operating system type, name, and version; and activities within our Site and Apps. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. Except as noted in this COPPA Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to a Child’s personal information.
We may also collect IP address, device identifier or a similar unique identifier from users of our Apps and Site; we only use such identifiers to support the internal operations of our Site and Apps in the same manner as described above.
We may also collect information from any mobile devices that a Child uses if the Child has downloaded one or more of our Apps to the device. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to the Child. Examples of information that may be collected and used include how the Child uses the App(s) and information about the type of device the Child is using. In addition, in the event our App(s) crash on a mobile device, we will receive information about the mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our App(s). This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
How We Use Children’s Information
We use the personal information that we collect from Children for the following general purposes:
To provide our Services;
To respond to customer service and technical support issues and requests;
To identify the Child as a user in our system;
To provide improved administration of our Site, App and Services; and
To tailor the content and information that we may display to Children, to offer personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize a Child’s experiences while using the Site, Apps, or Services.
As Requested by Teachers. When a Teacher or School provides a Child’s name and other personal information, we use that personal information for the following additional purposes:
To provide Children and Teachers with information and reports about a Child’s performance and use of the Site, Apps, and Services;
If requested, to facilitate creation of a Child’s account;
We do not use or disclose this personal information for our own commercial purposes.
Unique Identifiers. As noted, with the exception of unique identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers), our Site, Apps, and Services will not collect personal information from Children. We only collect and use unique identifiers as necessary to operate our Site, Apps, and Services, including to maintain or analyze their functioning; perform network communications; authenticate users or personalize content; and protect the security or integrity of users and our Site, App, and Services. We never use unique identifiers to track users across third party apps or websites.
Aggregate or De-identified Information. We may use aggregate or de-identified information about Children for research, analysis, and similar purposes. When we do so, we strip out names, email, contact information, and other personal identifiers. For example, we may use aggregate or de-identified information for one or more of the following purposes, among other purposes:
To better understand how users access and use our Site, Apps, and Services;
To improve our Site, Apps, and Services and respond to user desires and preferences; and
For other research and analytical purposes.
How We Share Children’s Information
We do not sell Children's personal information, and a Child may not make his or her personal information public through our services (though Teachers may choose to share a Child’s information and responses with the Child’s classmates or with other Teachers).

We will notify all users via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of the personal information we have collected, as well as any choices users may have regarding their personal information.
In Response to Legal Process. We may disclose personal information that we have collected from Children in order to comply with applicable law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process.

No Disclosure to Third Party Companies for Marketing. As stated above, we will not disclose personal information that we have collected from Children to any third party company for the third party company’s own direct marketing purposes.

Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
Cookies. We use cookies to track information about a Child’s use of our Site, Apps, or Services. “Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to a computer’s hard drive through a web browser for record-keeping purposes. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once a user closes a web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on a computer until a user deletes them). Some Cookies allow us to make it easier for a Child to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track a Child’s activities, but only as those activities relate to a Child’s use of our Site and Service.
Third-Party Analytics. We may also use third party analytics tools and technologies, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze data from our Site, Apps, or Services. Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the data collected by such third party analytics tools only to help us administer and improve the quality of our Site, Apps, and Services and to analyze Site and Apps usage. These third parties are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to help us conduct and improve our business. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to a user on the date the user visits the Site, rather than a user’s name or other personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on a user’s web browser to identify the user as a unique user the next time the user visits the Site, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about a user’s visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

Third-Party Links
Teachers may provide Children with links to third-party educational and learning resources located on third party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this COPPA Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.
Your Rights to Review, Delete, and Control Our Use  of Children’s Personal Information
Parents and Teachers have a right to review and correct the information we have collected about their Child(ren) and Students, respectively, and to delete it, and to tell us to update it or stop using it. To exercise these rights, you may contact us at  legal@socrative.com . You will be required to authenticate yourself as the Child's parent or Teacher to receive information about that Child. Please note that we cannot delete copies of information that a Child's Teacher has already collected and/or copied, and copies of information that you have deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site or Apps for a period of time.

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not be available to you.
