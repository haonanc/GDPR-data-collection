We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Sites.
Cookies
Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). This may include: which pages you see; how long you stay; what you click on our pages; if you visit the website again; and which country and city you are browsing from. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
Cookies may be set by an organization other than the Sites. These "third-party cookies" may, for example, originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest or other social media services.

You may disable cookies through your individual browser options. Visit http://www.aboutcookies.org/ for information on how to do this.
Google Analytics
One or more of our Sites may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience.
Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions and collects the Internet protocol (IP) address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from, but Google Analytics does not report visitors’ actual IP address information to us.
We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.

EEA Privacy Statement
Effective starting May 25, 2018
This EEA Privacy Statement discloses information about the privacy practices with respect to personal data protected under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the EEA. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.
The information provided in this statement applies to any of your EEA Personal Data that we may collect, use or otherwise process under the GDPR. An explanation of EEA Personal Data is provided below.
1. Information associated with tufts.edu and other Tufts Websites
For information associated with a Tufts website, this EEA Privacy Statement should be read together with the Privacy Statement for tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites that have pointed you to that statement (together, a "Site" or "Sites").
The Sites are published in the United States and are subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in the EEA and you voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in the Privacy Statement [add link] and in this EEA Privacy Statement and will be transferred to, and/or stored in, the United States.
2. Why have I been directed to this webpage?
The general information published on this page is intended to supplement specific information that you may have already been given in connection with your engagement with a particular service, facility, event or initiative run by Tufts. You may have been directed here, for example, because you are accessing an optional staff or student service or using a Tufts facility, or because you are using a particular website or online resource, or because you have signed up to attend an event aimed at prospective students or members of the public. The below information is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.
3. What is “EEA Personal Data?”
Your personal information is EEA Personal Data if:
It is “personal data” as defined in the GDPR; and
The GDPR includes protection of the personal data in its scope.
What is “personal data” under the GDPR?
The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).
What is the scope of the GDPR?
The GDPR generally applies to collecting, using or other “processing” (please see below) of personal data (as provided in Article 3):
When the processing is part of the activities of an organization that acts in an established way in the EEA. It’s not required that the processing take place in the EEA.
When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the organization offers goods or services to persons who are physically in the EEA. A payment for the goods or services is not required.
When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the processing activities are related to the monitoring of the behavior of a person who is physically in the EEA, as far as their behavior takes place within the EEA.
For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.
“Processing” is a term used by the GDPR to cover any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to destroying. GDPR Article 4 (2).
4. What is the purpose and lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data?
It is Tufts’ policy to collect, use and process EEA Personal Data about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under the GDPR. A legal basis under the GDPR may be:
We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests.
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
We need to process your data in connection with your or another person’s vital interest.
We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.
We have another legal basis permitted under the GDPR.
If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.
Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your EEA Personal Data. It is Tufts’ policy to not use EEA Personal Data to carry out any automated decision-making that affect you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the GDPR.
What are the purposes and lawful bases under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites?
Tufts will process your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance; email and other communications; processing you have requested; third-party services; and security and legal requirements.
The use of your EEA Personal Data in the manner described above and in the Privacy Statement are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Sites, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security. The Sites collect limited EEA Personal Data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms. Where you enter your EEA Personal Data into an online form on any of our Sites for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).
5. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?
We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your EEA Personal Data is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the GDPR.
6. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?
Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedules.
7. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?
The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR .
The right of access. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
The right to correct. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten). The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
The right to restrict processing. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
The right to data portability. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
The right to object. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.
8. Where can I go if I have questions?
If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data, please see How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR or contact Tufts' Data Privacy Team at dataprivacy@tufts.edu .
If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.
9. Changes to this Privacy Statement
Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.
This Privacy Statement was last updated on May 25, 2018.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA) provides individuals with rights relating to their EEA Personal Data.
Tufts’ EEA Privacy Statement describes what personal information qualifies as EEA Personal Data protected by the GDPR. For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.
The rights provided by the GDPR for EEA Personal Data include:
The right of access.
The right to correct.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten).
The right to restrict processing.
The right to data portability (to move the data to another party).
The right to object.
All of these rights are subject to certain exemptions and limitations. More information about these rights may be found in the GDPR and in the EEA Privacy Statement .
Requesting to exercise your rights under the GDPR is known as making a Subject Access Request (sometimes called an SAR). A Subject Access Request form is made available for your convenience. The form sets out where you should send your request and asks that you provide us with proof of your identity.
Confirm your identity
Be supplied with sufficient information from you in order to locate the information you seek.
On receipt of your completed request, verification of your identity, and sufficient details to enable us to locate the information, Tufts is obliged to provide you information on our actions on your request within one month. That period may be extended by two months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests.
If we determine not to fulfill your request, we are required to notify you within one month of our reasons for not doing so.
As provided in the GDPR, if a person’s data requests are clearly unfounded or excessive, we may charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs or decline to act on the requests.

EEA Privacy Statement for Job Applicants, Faculty, Staff, Consultants and Other Persons Providing Services
The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to job applicants, faculty, staff, consultants and other persons providing services whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.
This statement should be read together with the EEA Privacy Statement.
Specific sections are as follows:
What is “EEA Personal Data?”
For purposes of this statement for job applicants, faculty, staff, consultants and other persons providing services, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a job applicant, faculty, staff, consultant or other person providing services.
The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).
The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR. Article 4(2).
For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or when you are providing services on behalf of Tufts in the EEA, or if your personal information is used or otherwise processed in connection with a university established activity in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.

1. What is “EEA Personal Data”?
For purposes of this statement for participants, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a research participant. The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).
The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4(2).

6. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?
The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR .
The right of access. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.
The right to correct. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.
The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten). The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.
The right to restrict processing. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.
The right to data portability. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.
The right to object. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.
