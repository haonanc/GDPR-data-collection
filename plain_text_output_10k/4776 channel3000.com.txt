Privacy Policy
Welcome to Channel3000.com. Television Wisconsin, Inc. ("WISC"), operator of Channel3000.com, respects your privacy and takes it very seriously. This statement is provided to help you learn about our privacy policy and to help you understand what information we gather and what we do with that information. For purposes of this privacy policy, "we" or "our" applies to WISC and to all of the products, services and websites offered by WISC and/or its subsidiaries or companies under common ownership. This privacy policy does not cover the information practices of companies collecting data on our site or Web sites linked to our site.
What Information We Collect
In connection with your use of our sites, we collect two types of information: "Anonymous information" and "personally identifiable information.
Anonymous information refers to information we cannot link to a specific individual. This information includes your IP address (the number assigned by your internet service provider on a session-by-session basis to identify your computer so that the web pages you request can be sent to you), referral data (such as the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to one of our sites), and browser and platform type (such as a Netscape browser on a Mac platform). We use this anonymous information to tailor our sites to the needs and interests of our visitors and to improve our site by making it more responsive to those needs and interests.
Personally identifiable information tells us specifically who you are. We collect personally identifiable information about you when you use the Website (for example, when you register for certain services online, when you agree to participate in online surveys, when you make certain online information requests, when you opt in to receive an email newsletter, when you register to use our online commenting tool and when you participate in online contests and promotions) and when you register to become a Member of Channel3000.com. The personally identifiable information we collect may include your name, gender, postal address (including zip code), telephone number, user demographic information and email address. The Website also uses "cookies," which are small files that are sent to your computer’s hard drive when you visit the Website.
Please be advised that any personally identifiable information you provide (for example, by posting on the message boards or in open forums or chat rooms that we make available) can be viewed by all visitors to the site. Do not post any information that you do not want viewed by other users, and please contact us at tips@channel3000.com if you want to remove any personally identifiable information about yourself that has been posted by you or another.
How We Use Personally Identifiable Information
If you provide information about yourself during the course of using the Website, we may use that information to contact you. Such information may also be used to compile geographical statistical information and/or to learn how many users are visiting the Website. Channel3000.com uses cookies to recognize your browser, as well as to store certain user preferences, user passwords and other information. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. We track and record IP addresses that access our site for reporting and profiling purposes only. We also gather anonymous browsing habits of our visitors to better identify content preferences. You may use your browser to refuse cookies, but some features or services of Channel3000.com may not function properly without cookies. Moreover, any personally identifiable information you provide as User Content (i.e. content that you provide to the website) may be available for viewing by the public, including other Members. We also passively collect all user IP addresses, whether or not the user becomes a Member.
This site contains links to other sites and provides third parties with access to the Website. Third-party affiliates also may collect information about your use of the site. For example, some affiliates may provide relevant targeted advertising -- for example by using cookies in advertising that they display on our websites. Those cookies are not collected by us, and we do not have access to this information; however, this site may supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties – for example, from our partners in sponsored content sections. Other sites may collect information about your use of the site to facilitate social networking or other web services. This privacy policy does not cover such data collection, and we do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites or businesses to which we provide hyperlinks or access. To learn or more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising for some companies, you can visit http://www.networkadvertising.org and http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.
Occasionally when linking, you may still see our site's logo or frame, which provides you with a seamless experience when visiting our website. In these cases, you are no longer on Channel3000.com and are now on a different website whose information collection practices may differ from ours. The privacy policy of the site you are on will govern how information collected from you is used. Contact information will be used to notify contest winners and award prizes and in some instances may be shared with the contest or survey sponsor. User demographic information is shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis in a manner that will not personally identify the individual submitting such information.
In all other respects, we will not sell or otherwise provide access to any of our visitors’ personally identifiable information to any third party under any circumstances, unless (1) you consent to our doing so; (2) we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; (3) to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use; or (4) we must respond to a lawful subpoena, court order or other legal process.
If WISC becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of any or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may edit this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes to it, we will endeavor to notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify our users via email or by posting a notice on the site for 30 days.
