Affility is not responsible for those people or companies, the content of their products or services, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer.

2.2.3. Cookies, Beacons and Tracking
Affility may use “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags, locally shared objects, clear GIFs and web beacons. Affility treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.
A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that is sent to the Users’ computer. Affility’s cookies do not include personal data and may be used to: (1) facilitate Users’ login authentication, (2) help Users navigate around the Affility’s websites, (3) monitor how many people are using the Service, (4) store Users preferences and track trends, and (5) detect fraud and abuses of the Service.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can disable cookies or set your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Service.
Affility may also use Flash cookies (locally shared objects) and HTML5 storage (locally stored objects). Locally shared objects are small files similar to browser cookies and are used to remember your settings to personalize the look and feel of the Service. Locally shared objects only collect data in the aggregate.
You may prevent locally shared objects from being placed by disabling locally stored objects in your browser or by visiting www.adobe.com. Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies.
Affility may also use web beacons and pixel tags to count Users who have visited certain pages or viewed certain advertisements. Web beacons, like cookies, do not include personal data. E-mails and other electronic communications Affility sends to you may contain pixel tags that enable Affility to track your usage of the communication, including whether the communication was opened and/or what links were followed.
