Cookies and Other Similar Technologies
We may set and access our cookies on your computer and access and other technologies that tell us how you interact with us via our Websites, e-mails, and other technologies when you visit our Websites. Most Internet browsers have options for deleting, controlling and disabling or deleting cookies on your computer.
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the Sites. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. Our Websites use both 1st party cookies (which are set by the websites being visited) and 3rd party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our Websites). Essential cookies enable you to navigate our Websites and to use their services and features. Without these absolutely necessary cookies, our Websites will not perform as smoothly for you, and we may not be able to provide access to our Websites or certain services or features. Analytics cookies collect information about your use of our Websites, and enable us to improve the way they work. For example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our Websites, help us record any difficulties you have with our Websites, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. This allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on our Websites, rather than the usage of a single person. We use the information to analyze our Websites traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. Advertising cookies are set to display targeted promotions or advertisements based upon your interests on our Websites or to manage our advertising. These cookies collect information about your activities on this and other sites to provide you targeted advertising. When you fill out a form on our Websites (including but not limited to the free trial form, contact us form, and white paper forms), a visitor cookie is set in order to remember your preferences such as form field values and visited web pages. We use a third-party marketing automation tool to set visitor cookies. Depending on the country from which you visit our website, you may receive a message at the bottom of the page on your first visit notifying you of our use of cookies. By continuing to use our Websites without changing the cookie settings of your browser, you are opting in to our use of cookies. You may refuse or accept cookies from our Websites at any time by activating settings on your browser. Information about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider’s website via your help screen. Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of our Websites may operate as intended.
