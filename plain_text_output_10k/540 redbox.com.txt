This Privacy Policy only covers  information collected on the Redbox Platforms and does not cover any  information collected at any other web site or elsewhere by Redbox (unless  specifically stated).
Please review this  Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the  Terms of Use , which govern your use of the Redbox  Platforms.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY
Redbox  reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice and will notify you of material  changes by posting the changed or modified Privacy Policy on the Redbox  Platforms. We may also provide notice to you in other ways in our discretion,  such as through contact information you have provided. Any changes will be  effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy unless  otherwise specified and your continued use of the any of the Redbox Platforms after  the effective date of the revised Privacy Policy will constitute your consent  to those changes. However, Redbox will not make  material changes to how it treats previously collected Personal Information  about you without providing notice and giving you the chance to consent (opt-in  or opt-out).  Note, however, that you may  need to consent to our new policies in order to continue to use the Redbox  Platforms and our services.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
Information You Provide Us
We  may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, which is  information that identifies you as a specific identified  individual,  such as your name, phone number, or e-mail  address (collectively, “Personal Information”), and other information about  you, such as payment information,  demographic information (for example, your gender, age or similar information).  Certain features may also collect information about your preferences and  interests. If we combine demographic, preference-related or similar information  with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat that combined information as Personal  Information under this Privacy Policy.
Information We Collect Automatically
We  and third-party advertising companies and  service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically or  passively collect certain information whenever you visit any Redbox Platform or otherwise interact  with us or our content (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser,  and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you  to the Redbox Platform you are visiting,  all of the areas within the  Redbox Platforms that you visit, your time zone,  location information, and mobile  network (if applicable), among other information. In addition,  we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”)  for any computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access our Redbox Platforms. In some cases,  we may directly  collect location information through  your device. You  may be able to turn off the collection of location information through  the settings on your device.  Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Redbox associates it  with you as a specific and identifiable person, Redbox treats it as Personal  Information.
The  methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:
Cookies and Local Storage
Cookies and local storage are data files placed within  a browser on a device  when it is used to visit a Redbox  Platform. Certain web browsers  and browser add-ons, such as Adobe Flash, may provide additional local data  storage mechanisms. For example, a Flash cookie is a data file placed on  a device via the  Adobe Flash plugin. Cookies and  local storage can be used for a variety of purposes, including to store a  unique identifier for your device that recognizes  your device as you visit the Redbox Platforms or other web sites or online  services and to remember  your preferences. Most browsers provide you with the  ability to disable or decline cookies and local storage.  You will need to check  your browser’s  settings for further information. For more information about Flash and  the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html . If you choose to disable cookies or to  adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device,  some features of a Redbox Platform  may not function properly. 
Web Beacons
Small  graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”), may be included in our web pages and e-mail  messages.  Web beacons or similar  technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without  limitation, to count visitors to a Redbox  Platform, to monitor how users navigate a Redbox Platform, to count how many e-mails that were  sent were actually opened or to count how many particular videos or links were actually viewed.
In addition, we may use these and a  variety of other technologies that collect Usage Information and similar  information for security and fraud detection purposes and to enforce our  intellectual property rights.  This  includes the use of digital rights management technology that is embedded in  DVDs, streamed content or other content provided by Redbox in order to prevent  theft and unauthorized access to content, and to protect the intellectual  property rights of Redbox and content owners.
Information Third Parties Provide About You and  Social Media Interactions
Redbox  may receive information about you from third parties, including business partners and data providers.  You may also have the opportunity  to interact with  a third-party application  or feature available  through a Redbox Platform, such as features  that allow you  to log-in through,  access, or otherwise connect  your account  on a third-party service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). If you choose to  utilize such a third-party service,  we will receive information about you from that third-party service (which may  include Personal Information) and they may receive information about your use  of the Redbox Platforms.  Through these  features, third parties may  collect your IP address or other Device Identifier, which page you are visiting  on a Redbox Platform, and may set cookies to enable the third party feature to  function properly. If you choose to post information to a third party platform,  that information may be public.  You  acknowledge that, if you choose to post any information about your movie or  other rentals or viewing history on a third-party platform or in a Redbox  community forum (described below), the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (18 U.S.C. § 2710) (or any  similar state law) does not apply.  However, to the extent it does apply in any manner, you are  providing your informed, written consent to the disclosure of that information  pursuant to the Video Privacy Protection Act.
We  may combine the information we receive from those other sources with  information we collect through the Redbox Platforms. In those cases, we will  apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information. The information collected and stored by the third party is  subject solely to the third party’s privacy practices.
OUR USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE REDBOX PLATFORMS
Redbox  may use information collected through the Redbox Platforms, including Usage Information and Personal Information, to: (1) allow  you to participate in features we offer or to provide related customer service; (2) recognize you across the Redbox Platforms and across  devices; (3) tailor content recommendations and offers we display to  you, both on the Redbox Platforms and  elsewhere online; (4) process a rental, purchase, or other transaction; (5) provide you with information, products, or services that you have requested or  that we think may interest you; (6)  investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities or activities that violate our policies; (7) process  your registration, including verifying your information  is active and valid; (8)  improve the Redbox Platforms or our services and for internal business  purposes; (9) facilitate your  job search via the Redbox Platforms and prepare related governmental and  internal statistics reports; (10)  contact you with regard to your use of the Redbox Platforms or any Redbox service and, in our discretion, changes to the  Redbox Platform policies; and (11)  for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or  otherwise with your consent.  We may also use and share non-personal  information in our discretion and we may use non-personal information,  including information that has been de-identified (typically by using a  mathematical process known as a “hash”), to make inferences about you and  offers and content you may be interested in, to serve you with relevant  advertising, and to allow others to do so.
CHILDREN
The Redbox Platforms are not intended  for use by anyone younger than the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect  Personal Information from children younger than age 13.

COMMUNITY FORUMS
The  Redbox Platforms may offer message boards and other public areas (Community Forums) where you can choose to interact with others and/or to post  or submit content. Note  that anything you choose  to disclose in such a  community forum  is public.  It may be viewed, collected  and used by others and the protections  of this Privacy Policy will not apply.  Think carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal  Information. Please review the “User Comments and  Postings” section of our Terms of Use for information on the rights that you  grant to us in any content you choose to post in a community forum.

When You Request That We Share Your Information
We may share information when you request that we do so. For example, you may be presented with an  opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more  third parties. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information  shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties)  and will be subject to their privacy practices. Or,  you may choose to interact with a third party application or feature, through  which information about you is shared. Please note that we  are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. If you later  decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party,  you will need to contact that third party directly. <
Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf
We  may share information about you,  including Personal Information, with  third-party vendors to enable  them to perform services on  our behalf. Additionally, we  may share various information relating to our users and fraudulent or  potentially fraudulent activities with our  fraud prevention and similar vendors, and they will  use this information to help us and their other clients prevent fraudulent and illegal transactions.
Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions
We  may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration.  If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to  third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such  Promotion, including, without limitation, as required by law or permitted by  the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.

We  may also transfer and disclose user information, including Personal  Information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to  subpoenas or other legal process or if in our opinion such disclosure is  required by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an  investigation; or (iii) to protect and/or defend the Terms of Use , the Redbox Transaction Terms or other policies applicable to a Redbox  Platform or our services or to protect the personal safety, rights,  property or security of Redbox,  our customers, or a third  party. We may also use Device Identifiers, including IP  addresses, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright  owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law  enforcement agencies in our discretion.
Business Transfers
Redbox may share Personal Information with its parent, or its subsidiaries and  affiliates, primarily for business and operational purposes. Redbox  reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to a Redbox Platform, including Personal Information: (i)  to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of a Redbox  Platform or applicable database; or (ii) in connection with a  corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, bankruptcy,  the  sale of certain of Redbox’s ownership interests, assets, or both, or other  company change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due  diligence process.
THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS COMPANIES
Redbox  works with network advertisers, ad agencies and other advertising partners to serve Redbox ads online.  We also  use analytics providers to provide us with information regarding the use of the  Redbox Platforms and the effectiveness of our  advertisements. You may also see  ads on the Redbox Platforms  and those ads may be served by a third party. These third parties may set and access  their own tracking technologies on your device  (including cookies and web beacons ), and they may otherwise collect or have  access to information about you, including Usage Information. Some of these  parties may collect Personal Information over time when you visit the Redbox  Platforms or other online websites and services. We  may share non-personal information, including information that has been  de-identified, Usage Information, and location information, with third party  advertising companies, analytics providers and other third parties, including  for the purpose of serving you more relevant ads.
We may use a variety of companies to serve our  advertisements. Some of these companies are members of  the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance  (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and you may want  to visit the following webpages, which provide “opt-out” mechanisms for  participating companies: http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp ; http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ .  You may also be  able to opt-out from interest based advertising on your mobile device through  your mobile device settings.  You may  also opt-out from receiving targeted ads while on Redbox Platforms through your  account settings as further described below in “Your Choices.” Please note  opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served  advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online.
HOW WE RESPOND TO “DO NOT TRACK” SIGNALS
Note that your browser settings may  allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and  online services you visit. Like many websites and online services, the Redbox  Platforms do not alter their practices when they receive a “Do Not Track” from  a visitor’s browser.  To find out more  about “Do Not Track,” please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.
CHANGING YOUR INFORMATION
You  are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to  us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. Certain Redbox  Platforms allow you to correct  or update certain Personal Information you have provided and to  change your subscriptions or preferences regarding marketing information you  receive from Redbox. Note that when  you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on a Redbox  Platform, information that you remove may persist internally for Redbox’s  administrative purposes or within  backup media. If you have made  any public postings on a Redbox Platform, these communications cannot generally  be removed.
YOUR CHOICES
Redbox offers you the following choices with regard to the  information it collects through the Redbox Platforms:
Targeted Advertising. You  may see third party advertisements on Redbox Platforms; We offer you the ability to opt-out from  having your Redbox activity and other information about you used to serve  you targeted ads.  You may opt-out via  your Account settings.  Note that you  must be logged in to opt-out (or opt-in).  Opting out does  not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that  Redbox will no longer customize ads you see on Redbox Platforms based on your  activities or profile information with Redbox. You  may also opt-out from many third parties who serve online advertising,  including some who serve Redbox ads elsewhere online, by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp ; or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ . Opting out does not mean you will not  see any ads when browsing Redbox Platforms, but the ads you see will no longer be  customized to you based on your profile or interactions with Redbox.
Marketing Emails and Mobile Messages. You  may opt out of receiving marketing e-mails by following the opt-out  instructions provided to you in those e-mails.  Please note that we  reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account  or use of the Redbox Platforms or Redbox services, such as administrative and  services announcements.  These transactional account messages may be  unaffected if you choose to opt out from marketing e-mails.
If  you sign up to receive SMS or MMS messages from Redbox, you may unsubscribe  from any SMS or MMS messages received by replying “STOP”.
With your consent, we may send promotional and  non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device, and may in  some cases do so based on your device’s physical proximity to a beacon.  You can elect to stop receiving those  messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile  device.
YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California  Civil Code Section 1798.83  permits residents of California to request certain details about how their personal  information has been  shared during the calendar year with  third parties for those third-parties’ own direct marketing purposes, unless the business permits California residents  to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. Redbox qualifies for this  alternative option. As noted  above, we will not share personal information about you with third parties for  their own direct marketing purposes if  you do not opt-in, or if you choose to opt-out, at the time Redbox offers you  that choice.
If  you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with  respect to sharing personal information with third parties for their direct  marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please write us at Attention Legal, Redbox Automated Retail,  LLC, 1 Tower Lane, Suite 900, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181.
