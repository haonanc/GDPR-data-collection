Changes to This Privacy Policy
The information gathered when you interact with the iVenture Services falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.
Personal Information That You Give Us Or Ask a Third Party to Share with Us
Registration Information
Registration for the iVenture Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register.
You may register or enhance your profile by linking your Facebook or Google accounts on Riddles.com. By doing this, you are asking them to send us certain information from those social media accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can unlink your social media accounts or control what they share from their privacy controls.
Social media registration features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site.

User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments and Reader Reviews)
We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on Riddles.com and other iVenture Services. "Public activities" are any actions you take on Riddles.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit.

Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not Riddles.com.
