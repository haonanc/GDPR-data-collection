2. How We Collect Information
We may send cookies to your computer primarily to enhance your online experience. Cookies are small files that     can identify you as a unique user and store your personal preferences or technical information (including click     through and click stream data). Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you     delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). You can reset your browser to     refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, various features of our Services may     not properly function without cookies.
We may also use tracking systems such as web beacons which monitor your use of our Services. This tracking     system provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data,     such as the Internet Protocol address of a computer, the Uniform Resource Locator of the page displaying the     web beacon, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the web     beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When     corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our     e-mail.
On their own, cookies or web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However,     if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information through our Services, this information can be     linked to the data stored in the cookies/web beacons.

Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information, or consult the     instructions set forth by your mobile service provider or mobile device manufacturer. However, certain areas of     our websites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that     disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content.
