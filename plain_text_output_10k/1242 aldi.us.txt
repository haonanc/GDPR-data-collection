Information we Collect By Automated Means
When you use our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, web server logs, image pixels, web beacons and JavaScript.
Cookies are files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings on your device.  Our Sites may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies) and Flash cookies, as well as other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage).    Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain cookies.  You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash  Website Storage Settings Panel  and  Global Storage Settings Panel .  Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites or other websites and online services.
In conjunction with gathering information through cookies, our web servers may log information such as your device type, operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.  The web server logs also may record information such as the address of the web page that referred you to our Site and the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.  They also may log information about your interaction with this Site, such as which pages you visit.  To control which web servers collect information by automated means, we may place tags on our web pages called “Web beacons,” which are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.  We also may send instructions to your device using JavaScript or other computer languages to gather the sorts of information described above and other details about your interactions with the Sites and to provide you with content related to your online activities.  Both we and others (such as our service providers or advertising networks) may collect personal information about our visitors’ online activities over time and across third-party websites. Our Sites are not designed to respond to “do not track” signals received from browsers.
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Sites, such as those of Matomo.  The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address, time of request, address of the web page that referred you to one of our Sites, browser characteristics, operating system characteristics and other information collected by automated means) may be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.  You may choose not to have a unique web analytics cookie identification number assigned to your computer to avoid the aggregation and analysis of data collected on this website.  To prevent the collection of data on this website, please check the option below:

The providers of third-party plug-ins on our Sites, such as social sharing tools, may use automated means to collect information regarding your use of the Sites and your interactions with the plug-ins.  This information is subject to the privacy policies or notices of the plug-in providers and is not subject to this U.S. Online Privacy Notice.  We are not responsible for these providers’ information practices.
Internet-Based Advertising
Data about your activities online is being collected on our Sites for use in providing advertising tailored to your individual interests.  You may choose whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose.  This section of the U.S. Online Privacy Notice provides details and explains how to exercise that choice.
You may see certain ads on other websites because we participate in advertising networks administered by third parties and utilize third party service providers.  Networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the technologies described in the “Information We Collect By Automated Means” section above, and they use this information to show you advertisements that are tailored to your individual interests.  The information they collect includes information about your visits to our Sites, such as the pages you have viewed.  This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Sites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks, such as sites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad networks.  This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.  To learn more about ad networks, including how to opt out, visit  www.aboutads.info/choices .  We may also use third party service providers, such as Google’s Double Click to collect information through automated means for the purpose of direct Aldi-related advertising and other content to you. 
We do not sell or otherwise share personal information about you, except as described in this U.S. Online Privacy Notice.  We share personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf.  We also may share the personal information we obtain with our affiliates.  When you enter a nickname after completing a game on our Sites, we may post the nickname and your score on a publicly available score list. 
Our Weekly Ads pages are operated by Flipp (“Flipp”), whose own privacy policies apply to the collection, use and disclosure of information obtained through the Weekly Ads pages by Flipp and its partners (such as Flipp’s ad networks).  Flipp may use browser and flash cookies, HTML 5 web storage, pixels and web beacons on our Weekly Ads pages.  Similarly, the collection, use and disclosure of information by social media sites in connection with ALDI’s social media pages and accounts, including on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, is subject to those sites’ privacy policies. 
We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or legal process (such as a court order or subpoena), (ii) in response to requests by government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.  We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
