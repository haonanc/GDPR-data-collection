Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (“CHOP”) has created these policies to demonstrate its commitment to privacy. It discloses our information-gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site (the “Service”). You usually can visit the Service without submitting any information about yourself. If you send us e-mail, respond to a survey, join our Online Community or otherwise subscribe to one of our on-line publications or email newsletters, then naturally we will have your name and e-mail address. We will use them only for replying to your message or forwarding the requested material. We do not share this information with any other partners, affiliates or members of CHOP or with any outside organization.
Log File Data
The Service collects domain names of site visitors, as well as aggregate information about site traffic and server load. We use this information to maintain and improve our Web site. We also store IP addresses and host names for auditing and security purposes.
Cookies
The Service uses transient “cookies” during a site visit but does not gather information from a user’s computer. The “cookie,” which is a small text file stored in temporary memory, is used by our Web application for usability purposes and to comply with subscription preferences that our visitors have given us. No personal identifying data is collected and the “cookie” is erased when the visit ends.
The Service also uses persistent “cookies” on a limited basis to measure the effectiveness of its Web advertising. These “cookies” expire after 30 days and each page on which they are placed is noted by a small icon and message. You can turn off cookies in your browser preferences at any time without affecting site performance, if you wish to do so.
Online Comment Forms
Please note that CHOP will not intentionally share the contents of any e-mail feedback or comment form with any third party. However, due to the nature of electronic communications, we cannot and do not provide any assurances that the contents of your e-mail will not become known or accessible to third parties.
WE URGE YOU NOT TO PROVIDE ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU OR YOUR HEALTH TO US VIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION. IF YOU DO SO, IT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Children's Privacy
We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The Service is intended for adults and young adults age 13 and over. It is not intended for or designed to attract persons under the age of 13. We do not permit registration by, nor do we collect personally identifiable information from, any person we actually know to be under the age of 13.
Other Sites
Our privacy policies apply only to your use of the Service. The Service contains links to other sites, including sites that may indicate a special relationship with us. While we do not disclose personally identifiable information to those operating these linked sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. You should read the privacy policies of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be collecting about you.
E-mail Communications, Newsletters and Related Services
The Service provides you with the opportunity to receive communications from us. Once you have decided to receive such communications, you may later decide to stop receiving them. If you are a member of our Online Community and want to stop receiving communications, you may go to  www.chop.edu/newsletter-unsubscribe.jsp , log in as you normally would, and change or deselect your subscription options. You may also send a message to our  Web Access Center  or send mail to the following postal address: Web Access Center, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Web Center, 34th Street and Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104.
Passwords
You are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to your CHOP passwords or accounts. It is your sole responsibility to (1) control the dissemination and use of activation codes and passwords; (2) authorize, monitor, and control access to and use of your CHOP account and password; (3) promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a password. You grant to CHOP and to all other persons or entities involved in the operation of the Service the right to transmit, monitor, retrieve, store, and use your information in connection with the operation of the Service. CHOP cannot and does not assume any responsibility or liability for any information you submit, including to online Community, or your or third parties' use or misuse of information transmitted or received using CHOP tools and services, including Online Community and Referring Physician Web Site.
Changes to Our Privacy and Security Policies
Just as with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, we may change the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policies at any time by posting revisions on the Service.
You agree to review the Privacy Policies each time you use the Service so that you are aware of any modifications made to these policies. By accessing or using the Service (as it is defined in the terms and conditions), you agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as posted on the Service at the time of your access or use, including the Privacy Policies then in effect.
