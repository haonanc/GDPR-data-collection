Cookies
A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and allows us to improve our site. We use "analytical" cookies to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. If you register with us or complete our online forms, we will use cookies to remember your details during your current visit, and any future visits provided the cookie was not deleted in the interim. If you click on sponsored results when using our service, you may be redirected to the partner/advertiser's site via affiliate cookies. You can disable and/or delete all types of cookies by using your browser settings. Cookies are generally easy to disable and/or delete but how you do so varies from browser to browser. The "help" function within your browser should tell you how to do it. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to make use of all or part of our website or service.

How we use your data
Lawful Basis for Controlling and Processing your data
Qmee will only collect and process your data where we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given us your consent) and “legitimate interests” where the processing of your data is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
Sign Up Data
We process this data to have a record of our users. Our lawful basis for processing your data is “legitimate interest”. We do not share this information with anyone else. We will retain this data for as long as your account is open.
Search Data
We will process this data to understand your interests, to deliver rewarded results to you that will be of interest and keep a history of your rewards. Qmee uses an automated system to profile your interests from the searches that you have made. This may cause different or no rewarded results to be shown. The lawful basis for processing your data is  “legitimate interest”. We will not share your personal search data with anyone else. We will retain this data for a period of one year. Qmee may anonymise and use your search data for statistical analysis and insight. We may also share anonymised data with partners .
Cash Out
We will process this data to retain a record of your transactions with us. This data is retained permanently as part of our transaction records for tax, audit and regulatory purposes.
Survey Profile Data
We use this information to match you to eligible surveys. Our lawful basis for processing this data is “legitimate interest”. We share this information with our survey partners so that they can also match you to surveys. Some of our survey partners are located outside of the EEA so will require an international transfer of your data, for details see the section on International Transfers. We will retain this data while your account is open or until you remove it. Please note that without basic profile data we will be unable to match you to any surveys. We may ask you for additional demographic data to improve our ability to match you to surveys; these questions are optional.
Some additional demographic data may be special category data which is more sensitive. We will ask you to explicitly consent before we store any such data. We will use this data in the same way as normal demographic data. You may withdraw your consent at any time and we will delete any special category data that we hold. You may control these settings on your profile page.
Qmee Mobile Application
We process this data to ensure that we are talking with the correct user. Our lawful basis for processing your data is as a legitimate interest. We do not share this data. We will store this information while your account is open.
Service Data, Security and Investigations
Qmee may use all the information we store about you to assess whether you are abusing our service contrary to our terms and conditions and to protect other users of our services. We may also use this data to detect security breaches. Our lawful basis for processing your data in this way is “legitimate interest”. We will retain this information indefinitely.
Third party sites
This website contains links to other websites operated by third parties. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the personal information that we collect and we cannot be responsible for personal information that third parties may collect, store and use through their websites. Once you click on a link to a third party's website, including sponsored links provided in the Qmee window, that third party's collection, storage and use of your personal information is out of our control. You should always read the privacy policy of each website you visit carefully.
Data Storage
Qmee uses cloud based services for processing and storing your personal data. Qmee currently uses cloud based services based in the USA, such as Amazon AWS and Heroku,  requiring an international transfer. These cloud based services have a Data Processing Addendum to their terms of service to ensure compliance with EU privacy standards.
Your Rights
