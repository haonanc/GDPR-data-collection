Information we collect from you
Personally Identifiable Information
Our Website enables you to search for jobs in your area, register to receive emails about future job postings, participate in interactive areas such as My Account or to permit employers to contact you directly regarding job offerings. You may search without registering, but in order to apply for a job, receive email communications, participate in the interactive areas to be found at My Account or be contacted by an employer interested in you for employment, you will have to register with SnagAJob.com. We sometimes collect the following personally identifiable information:
Email address
Social Security Number
We also collect the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our Website, as well as the IP address of the computer you are using (or the proxy server you use to access our Website), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, mobile device operating system (if you are accessing our Website using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier in order to provide us with a way to verify your identity, and to provide us with information that we aggregate with that of other users in order to help diagnose problems with our server, run our Website better and to communicate with advertisers (see “How we use information we collect from you,” below).
Your personally identifiable information allows us to share your job preferences and work experiences with prospective employers, communicate with you about potential employment opportunities, our business and our Website, improve the information on and operation of our Website, customize the Website to your individual preferences and ensure your compliance with our Terms of Use and any other restrictions noted on the Website.
In addition to providing us with your personally identifiable information and your IP address, if you chose to participate in the interactive portions of our Website found at My Account, you will have to complete a user profile in which you may describe your skills, professional experiences, educational background, recommendations from other Website users, group memberships, and networking objectives (this information, together with your personally identifiable information, shall be referred to collectively herein as your “Personal Information”). Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you, but providing such additional information enables you to derive more benefit from the Website and your professional network by helping you build and leverage your professional network and facilitating your search for professional resources, information, and new opportunities. Any Personal Information you provide at registration or in the profile section may be used by us as we describe in the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. If you decide not to share such Personal Information, you may not receive the full benefit of being a Website Member.
In order to connect with others on MySnag, you may use the Website to send invitations either to other Members or to email addresses of individuals who are not Members. The names and email addresses of people whom you invite will be used by us to send your invitations and reminders as well as to allow us to help expand our network. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another Member, that Member will then have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation. The Members with whom you will connect at My Account will also have access to your email address. You may not invite anyone to connect with you at My Account whom you do not know and trust.
You may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts to the “Contacts” section of your account with us. Information entered into Contacts is only viewable by you and us. By providing email addresses or other information of non-Members, you represent that you have authority to do so. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts will be covered by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy and will enable us to provide customized services such as suggesting people to connect on our Website.
We may collect information through our Website in order to, among other things, accurately categorize and respond to Member inquiries and investigate breaches of our terms.

Polls and surveys on our Website
Polls and surveys may be conducted us, our Members or our Sponsors. As a Member, you may be invited to participate in polls and surveys from our Website. Your selection may be random, or it may be based on your non-personally identifiable information, such as job title, geographic location, company size and/or industry. Whether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you.
After you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page.

Further, we or our Sponsors may follow up with you via e-mail in your My Account account regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving such e-mail messages.
We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls.

It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive.

Your consent to use any Personal Information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. You may opt-out of participating in surveys by changing your settings to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.

How we protect the information you give to us
We have implemented a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your Personal Information. We keep your Personal Information on a central database on a secured network in the United States that can be accessed only by a limited number of persons who are required to keep such information confidential. We audit our network regularly for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
By using the Website, you grant us and all other persons or entities involved in the operation of our Website the right to receive, transmit, monitor, retrieve, store and use your Personal Information, including information that may be privileged and confidential under applicable state and federal laws, in connection with the operation of our Website and our maintenance of your Personal Information.

There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

We may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide our Website services to other Members. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send via the My Account portion of our Website to other Members, as well as your contributions to MySnag discussion groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Members have copied, may also remain visible. We disclaim any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. We do not control when search engines update their caches, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from our publicly viewable database.
If we learn that a Member is deceased, we may close such Member’s account. In those cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the Member’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.
