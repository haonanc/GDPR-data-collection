is needed for system administrators to diagnose and correct problems with system software or hardware;
may yield information needed to deal with an emergency;
is needed for the ordinary business of the Institute to proceed, (e.g., access to data associated with an employee who has been terminated/separated or is pending termination/separation, is deceased, is on extended sick leave, or is otherwise unavailable);
is necessary to comply with a written request from the Vice President for Student Life on behalf of the parents, guardian, or personal representative of the estate of a deceased student; or
is for research authorized by Georgia Tech under a data use agreement that precludes the disclosure of personally identifiable information.
