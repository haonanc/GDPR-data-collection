Version 1.10
Effective date: January 6, 2017
doxo is designed for doxo users to organize Provider accounts; manage personal account information, reminders, and documents; and establish connections with Providers to receive documents paperlessly and pay bills – all in one place.
doxo is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any and all personal information about doxo Users. This Privacy and Security Policy (the “Policy”) explains how doxo protects information provided through our websites  www.doxo.com  and  user.doxo.com  and applications accessing those websites (the “Site”) and how doxo uses that information in connection with the doxo service offered through the Site (the “Service”). “Private Information” for purposes of this Policy means information provided to us that identifies you, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, any account information or other information you store about your relationship with your Providers, and any documents and accompanying information that are stored on your behalf by doxo.
doxo privacy standards are designed to guard against identity theft, to protect sensitive data, and provide security for your Private Information. doxo regularly re-evaluates privacy and security policies and adapts them as necessary to deal with new challenges.
Capitalized terms used by not defined in this Policy will have the meanings defined in the Terms of Service.
1. Your Private Information is not for sale
Simply put, doxo will not sell or rent your Private Information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. doxo uses and discloses your Private Information only as follows:
to analyze Site usage and improve the Service;
to deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service;
for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;
to third-party contractors that provide services to Doxo and are bound by privacy restrictions at least as protective as this Policy (e.g. auditors, technical consultants);
to enforce Doxo’s Terms of Service; and
as otherwise set forth in this Policy.
2. What information doxo collects and stores for you
Certain areas and features of the Site are available to you without registration or the need to provide doxo any information. However, other features of the Site or the Service require registration, which may involve provision to doxo of an email address, a user name, a password and a shared secret, and your zip code (collectively the “Registration Information”). In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Service, if you choose to establish a “connection” with a Provider on doxo (“Connect” or “Connection”) you also may be required to provide your account credentials for those Providers (“Account Credentials”). When you Connect to a Provider within the Service, you elect to share certain information from your doxo User profile with that Provider or other information (“Account Information”), and any Account Information or documents you exchange with that Provider will be accessible to that Provider.
From time to time doxo may request other Private Information to provide you with other benefits of the Service. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose. doxo may make anonymous or aggregate Private Information and use and disclose such data only in a non-personally identifiable manner to:
improve the design, functionality and content of the Service;
to enable Providers to improve their use of the Service and to benefit their customers through the Service;
to provide reports and analysis that may benefit Users or Providers; or
to develop products and services that might interest Doxo Users and Providers.
Such information does not identify you individually.
To verify identity of users and/or detect patterns of activity that may indicate or help prevent fraud, our Service may utilize fraud prevention services and methods designed to protect payment account information or other Private Information from being used in a fraudulent manner through the Service. These methods utilized include use of Sift Science’s anti-fraud service. Sift Science can use your Private Information in accordance with their privacy policy on their website at  siftscience.com .
Typically no doxo employee will ever access your Private Information. In certain rare circumstances, if security, fraud, or other problems are identified or are suspected involving your account, a doxo employee may need to access some portion of your Registration Information, Account Credentials, Account Information or any other Private Information to eliminate such problems. Any such access is always logged and monitored and is only conducted to the extent necessary to address the problem. Any employees that conduct such activity have been selected in accordance with doxo security policies and practices and are bound by confidentiality obligations. They are subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. In those circumstances, doxo may share Private Information with the applicable Provider as necessary to fix the security, fraud, or other problems.
3. Changes to the information doxo collects
If your Registration Information or any other information stored in doxo changes, you may update it any time by logging into the Service and editing the information online via your account.

If you join doxo by accepting an invitation from another doxo user, doxo may notify the person who sent the invitation that you joined doxo or that you took certain actions if those actions result in a benefit or reward to the person sending the invitation.

9. Your data is secure and accessible only by you
doxo uses a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among others, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect doxo accounts and systems from unauthorized access.
When you register for the Service, doxo requires a password from you for your privacy and security. You also are required to select a security image to help protect from phishing attacks. doxo servers are operated in a secure facility. Access requires multiple levels of authentication, including biometrics (hand print scan) procedures. Security personnel monitor the facilities 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
doxo databases are protected from general employee access both physically and logically. doxo encrypts your Service password so that your password cannot be recovered, even by doxo. All backup drives and tapes also are encrypted.
All Private Information (including any documents stored on your behalf) is always encrypted with 256 bit encryption, or an equivalent or superior technology, and is only viewable by you after entering your login credentials.
No employee may put any sensitive content on any insecure machine (i.e., nothing can be taken from the database and put on an insecure laptop).
doxo tests the Site daily for any failure points that would allow hacking.
However, it is important to understand that these precautions apply only to the Site and systems. doxo exercises no control over how your information is stored, maintained or displayed by you, third parties or on third-party sites.
No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
10. doxo uses secure communications
From the time you submit your login credentials, the communications between your computer and doxo are encrypted using industry-standard 128 bit Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL3”) technology or an equivalent or superior technology. SSL3 enables client and server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering and message forgery.
Any data transmitted between one of your Providers and doxo (e.g. when establishing a Connection or sending and receiving documents from the Provider) is secured at all times using SSL3 and encrypted in transport between the Provider and doxo.
11. You are responsible for protecting your access credentials
doxo maintains strict rules to help prevent others from guessing your password. doxo also recommends that you change your password periodically. Your password must be at least 6 characters in length and contain a combination of letters, numbers or special characters. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your doxo user name and password. You are specifically restricted from providing these credentials to any third party. If you believe that they have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact doxo immediately at  security@doxo.com  and change your password immediately via the Service. doxo is not responsible if someone else accesses your account through Registration Information they have obtained from you or through a violation by you of this Policy or doxo’s Terms of Use.
