Sparc and Session Cookies
The Sparc web site uses session cookies to enable making transactions on our site. A session cookie is a small file placed on your computer which acts as a unique identifier to keep track of the information you have entered. Without the session cookie, our site cannot track the information you are entering, and you will be unable to complete your transaction.
A session cookie does not remain on your machine after you close your web browser window. Our session cookie contains none of your personal information, and cannot be used to track you around the web. It can only be used by our web site to identify the information you have entered during the transaction process which is required to complete the transaction.
