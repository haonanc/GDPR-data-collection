How We Use and Share Personal Information We Collect
The Personal Information we collect and the practices described above are done in an effort to provide you with the best experience possible, protect you from risks related to improper use and fraud, and help us maintain and improve Gemini.
We may share Personal Information with third-party service providers (including those that may be located outside of the United States or your country), who help us operate our platform and systems, and detect fraud and security threats throughout the normal course of our business. Such third-party service providers are subject to strict confidentiality obligations. In addition, we may be compelled to share Personal Information with law enforcement, government officials, and regulators.
For example, we may use your Personal Information to:
Provide you with our services, including customer support for Gemini;
Optimize and enhance our services for all customers or for you specifically;
Conduct anti-fraud and identity verification and authentication checks (you authorize us to share your Personal Information with our third-party service providers, who may also conduct their own searches of publicly available Personal Information about you);
Monitor the usage of our services, and conduct automated and manual security checks of our services; and
Create aggregated and anonymized reporting data about our services.
If we decide to modify the purpose for which your Personal Information is collected and used, we will amend this Privacy Policy.
If we propose to sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your Personal Information in an anonymized form to the prospective buyer or seller of such business or assets.

Be aware that bitcoin, ether, and other Digital Assets are not necessarily truly anonymous. Generally, anyone can see the balance and transaction history of any public Digital Asset address. We, and any others who can match your public Digital Asset address to other Personal Information about you, may be able to identify you from a blockchain transaction. This is because, in some circumstances, Personal Information published on a blockchain (such as your Digital Asset address and IP address) can be correlated with Personal Information that we and others may have. This may be the case even if we, or they, were not involved in the blockchain transaction. Furthermore, by using data analysis techniques on a given blockchain, it may be possible to identify other Personal Information about you. As part of our security, anti-fraud and/or identity verification and authentication checks, we may conduct such analysis to collect and process such Personal Information about you. You agree to allow us to perform such practices and understand that we do so.
Information Security

We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we work hard to protect Gemini and you from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Information we collect and store. Measures we take include encryption of the Gemini website communications with SSL; required two-factor authentication for all sessions; periodic review of our Personal Information collection, storage, and processing practices; and restricted access to your Personal Information on a need-to-know bases for our employees, contractors and agents who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
Accuracy and Retention of Personal Information
We take reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that your Personal Information held by us (i) is accurate with regard to the purposes for which it is to be used, and (ii) is not kept longer than is necessary for the fulfillment of the purpose for which it is to be used, which is when your business relationship with us ends, unless the further retention of your Personal Information is otherwise permitted or required by applicable laws and regulations.
