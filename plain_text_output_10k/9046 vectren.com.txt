Policies
Information collection and use
Vectren collects information from our users at several different points on our web site. We do this in a secure fashion to understand how to better serve our customers. Vectren is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information collected on this site to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.
The information contained in your e-mail or communication will be used to access customer services, respond to or communicate with you, address issues you identify, further improve this web site, or forward your e-mail or communication to another agency or entity for appropriate action. Information received by Vectren from your communication with this web site, including your e-mail address, is not collected for commercial marketing purposes.
Registration
We require Vectren customers to register so that we may create unique user ID and password (login) information. Residential and business customers may create their username and password, which allows them to gain access to their personal, protected account information.
During registration users must submit their contact and account information (such as name, email address and utility account number). This information is used to contact users about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest so that we may complete their requests.
Correction/updating personal information
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your phone number), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide assistance to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done on the manage profile page or by emailing a Vectren Customer Service Specialist.
Order
We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (like name and service address) and financial information (like bank account information). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's request. If a request cannot be processed correctly, this contact information is necessary to contact the user.
Security
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, the information is protected both online and off-line.
Our registration/order form may ask users to enter sensitive information (such as bank account information and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected - utilizing the industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our order form, the URL in the browser window will begin with 'https,' and the padlock icon at the bottom of the web browser window will appear locked, ensuring the transaction is safe. On other pages, this icon may appear un-locked, or open, indicating that the user is surfing an insecure page.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also take extra precaution to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is maintained in restricted areas in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (i.e. - our billing clerk or a customer service specialist) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Additionally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to Vectren Customer Service Specialist.
Sharing
We do not currently share any specific demographic information from this site with outside parties, nor do we provide specific credit or usage information to outside service providers. Vectren may provide customer contact information to outside providers. Such information exists independent from information collected from this site. This type of information would not be associated with a user's personal information and would not be used to identify an individual person.
We do work with outside companies to process customer billing and payment. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
In the event that we partner with another party to provide specific services, we will share names and other contact information when the user signs up for these services. These parties cannot use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these specific services.
Supplementation of information
In order for this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from outside sources.
For example, in some cases to determine if our customers qualify for one of our services or if a deposit is required, we use their name and social security number to verify their identity and credit history.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer containing information about the user. By accepting a cookie, the user may save time on our site, by not have to log in a password more than once. A user that rejects the cookie may still use our site; however, the user's actions may be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user may have to enter contact and billing information repeatedly. Using cookies enables us to target the interests of our users and enhance the experience on the site.
Log files
Web servers create log files in a standard fashion across the Web. We use our web server log information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for the aggregate use of the site.
Site and service updates
Users may receive site and service announcement updates. Members cannot un-subscribe from these service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to his/her account via email or phone.
Surveys & contests
From time-to-time our site users may be asked to submit information for surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user may choose whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
