The Information We Collect and How We Collect It
Personally Identifiable Information.The MedicareSolutions.com website (the "Site") collects two kinds of information that relates to you.The first, and most  important to you, is information that is personally identifiable to you. This is information like your name, telephone  number, email address, home address and social security number. We do not collect personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") unless you decide to provide us with it.  To be clear, you are never required to provide us with Personal Information but  not all of the services we offer will be available to you without that information.For example, we will ask for your contact information if you have requested us to send you information about certain plans or services.
Personal Information also includes information on your health. However, we do NOT ask for and do NOT collect Medical Records from you.Those records remain between you and your  doctor.
If at any time you would like to review or update the Personal Information we have collected about you, please contact us and we will arrange for you to do so. While  you work with us, you remain in control of all of your personal information at  all times.

This type of information may include items such as your IP (Internet  protocol) address, Internet service provider, operating system, type of browser  and the pages or sections you visit on the Site ("Non-Personal  Information").This type of Non-Personal Information is collected in various ways, but the primary methods we use are  (i) cookies, which are little pieces of  code that allow us to recognize you when you visit our Site, (ii) web beacons (or gifs) which allow us to see how you use our Site, and to know whether you have visited a web page or received or opened an email message, and (iii) standard Internet tracking tools to collect information like service provider IP addresses, browser versions, referring websites, search terms used, average number of pages requested, average duration of visit, and/or total visitor traffic.Most Non-Personal Information is stored in what are often referred to as  log files.

We have also contracted  with other third parties to provide the same services so as to ensure that your  questions are answered and so that more than one opinion may be made available  to you.
