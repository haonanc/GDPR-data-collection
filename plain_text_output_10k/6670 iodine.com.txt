Private Data [
]
On Iodine, we’ll sometimes ask you for information that identifies you personally (such as your name or email address). We mark this Private Data with a lock symbol [
]. We only share Private Data with your permission, or in some standard ways that we tell you about very clearly in our Privacy Policy.
For example
Shared Data [
]
Shared Data is any information you provide on Iodine that’s not Private Data. This includes any demographic info or real-life experience that you choose to submit (such as your age, gender, medications, conditions, or drug ratings and reviews). If you don’t see a lock symbol [
] next to the field you’re completing, the information you enter is Shared Data. It’s shared publicly on Iodine to help other users. Also, unless you opt out, we share it with trusted Iodine partners, such as medical researchers and collaborators.
For example
Female, 61
Takes lisinopril for high blood pressure.
‘I started having a dry cough after taking this medication, and I’m thinking about switching.’
Statistical Data
We share statistics about our users publicly on Iodine and with trusted Iodine partners, such as medical researchers and collaborators.
For example
‘53% of women aged 35-54 thought this medication was worth it.’
Control your privacy
Don’t publicly share information that can be used to identify or contact you. For example, don’t write your name in a review about a medication.
Share as much or as little about your experiences as you want. For example, you can post comments about a medication without sharing your age, gender, or medical conditions.
Opt out of sharing Shared Data with trusted Iodine partners.

We know that when you use Iodine, you’re trusting us with your information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information. We want it to be easy for anyone (not just lawyers) to understand. Send feedback to privacy@iodine.com .
Unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words we use here have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use .
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your information. We’ve tried to make it easy to understand.
Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We may solicit user feedback about changes but are under no obligation to use it. We’ll notify you of any changes in one or more of the following ways at least 30 days before changes are implemented:

Information we collect
Information you give us when you use Iodine might include:
Personally identifying information, such as your name or email address
Demographic information, such as age and gender
Health information, such as medications and conditions
Other real-life experience information, such as comments about your health or medications or responses to our surveys
For example, if you create an Iodine Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address and phone number. If you create an Iodine Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other personally identifying information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.
If you provide it to us, we may also collect other information that is not considered personally identifying information because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your gender, age or date of birth.
We collect and store the information you choose to submit on Iodine. Certain information is required to create an Iodine Account.
Information we collect automatically
Like most websites and apps, we automatically collect certain information about how visitors use our services. We do this with automated data collection tools such as server logs , analytics , cookies , and web beacons .
Through the Site: For example, when you use the Site, our server logs store your IP address , browser type, operating system, and the pages you visited on Iodine. Here’s another example: we put a cookie (a marker) on your browser so our website knows that you already completed a survey about a drug and doesn’t ask you to do it again. Cookies are stored on your hard drive. On the other hand, web beacons are usually embedded on webpages or in e-mails. Like server logs, web beacons can also tell us what pages you visited on the Site.
Through the Iodine Apps: When you use an Iodine App, we collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use the Iodine App, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of Iodine.
Location Information: We may also collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.
Some third-party service providers that we engage (including third-party analytics service providers) may also use their own automated data collection tools, including placing their own cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to these third parties.
Also, we automatically collect standard information about how visitors use our services.

You cannot opt-out of sharing your Shared Data with our Partners if you submit that Shared Data via an Iodine App.
Even if you have an Iodine Account, your opt-out is not associated with a particular login or user account. Therefore, if you opt out via the Site, we’ll track your opt-out choice by placing a cookie on your device that will tell us that you have opted out. If you delete the Iodine cookie from your device, please remember that you’ll have to opt out again on Iodine to opt out of sharing any new Shared Data that you submit after deleting the cookie. You can hover over the [
] on the Site to check your opt-out status.
While using Iodine, you might share multiple pieces of real-life information that could identify you, if combined. It’s also possible to include personally identifying information in free-text fields this information will still be treated as Shared Data, so be careful. It’s your choice whether to provide Shared Data and what to include when you post publicly.
If you don’t see the [
], the information you’re submitting is Shared Data.
Shared Data includes anything you post publicly on Iodine.
We share Shared Data with trusted Iodine partners unless you opt out .

We share general statistical information about users publicly on Iodine and with our Partners.
Our service providers
We may share information with third party companies and individuals that provide services to us, such as database management and web analytics.
These third-party services providers may have access to your Private Data, but only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf, and they are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your Private Data for any other purpose.
We might share information with people and companies that provide services to us—for example, companies that help us manage and analyze data.

To respond to claims, law enforcement requests and subpoenas (we’ll notify you about this if we’re allowed to)
We might share information if we think it’s required by law or to protect Iodine and our users—for example, to investigate if someone tries to hack our site or any Iodine app.
In the event of a business trans
