If you use DJI Products and Services to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) information that may interest them (such as videos or photos hosted on DJI’s SkyPixel video and photograph hosting and sharing service (“SkyPixel”)) or messages (such as invitations to comment on videos or photos, use DJI Products and Services, or participate an event) through DJI Products and Services, we may store information about you and information relating to each such recipient. Similarly, if you use DJI Products and Services to upload, share and/or distribute content, photos, videos, flight data, or other submissions, and such content contains information about others, we may store, process, and disclose that information as provided for under this Policy. Please note, under such circumstances, you should obtain appropriate consent from others and inform them about this Policy.
Cookies and Automatically Collected Information. When you use certain DJI Products and Services, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.
A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete or choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to utilize the features of DJI Products and Services to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies as well.  For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data.  DJI does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use DJI Products and Services.
We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use a Product or Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on a Product or Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use DJI Products and Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.
Our use of cookies and other automatically collected information is explained further in our Cookie Policy.
Device-Related and Flight-Related Information.  When you use DJI Products and Services, you may provide us with information relating to (i) your DJI Product or Service, your non-DJI device on which the DJI Product or Service is used (including computers, phones, or other devices where you install or access DJI Products and Services), and your photos or videos that you upload using DJI Products and Services.  This information may include: (i) information about your non-DJI device (including your device ID, hardware version, and operating system); (ii) information about your DJI device (including the model and serial number of your device); (iii) geolocation data relating to your non-DJI device and DJI device and any photo or video you submitted using DJI Products and Services; (iv) information about any photo or video recorded, including the name of the video file, the length of the video, EXIF data relating to the photo or video; (v) other technical information, including the IP address used by your non-DJI device, and flight data; and (vi) data associated with your DJI account.

Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. We may display third-party content on or through DJI Products and Services, including third-party advertising.  We also may enable you to connect your DJI account to, or otherwise interface with, third party services, including third party social networks and communications services.  In addition, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by DJI. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
For further information, please review our Cookie Policy.
