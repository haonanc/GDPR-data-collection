What Personal Information About Customers Does VS Billing Support Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at VS Billing Support. Here are the types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any     information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way.  You can choose not     to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of     many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as     responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our services,     and communicating with you.
You provide most such information when you buy, or participate in a contest or     questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide     information when you purchase a product; join a site; provide information to customer     support regarding an account (you might have more than one if you have used more than     one e-mail address, user name, or credit card when shopping with us); communicate     with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; or complete a questionnaire or a contest     entry form. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information     as your name, address, and phone number; credit card information; e-mail addresses;     birth date and content of e-mails to us.
Automatic Information: We receive and store     certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many     Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your     Web browser accesses VS Billing Support.  A number of companies offer utilities designed     to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Due to the sensitive issues involving     access to adult content by children, we do not permit access to our sites from     these anonymous services.
Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol     (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login name; e-mail     address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and     version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform     Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including     date and time; cookie number; products you viewed; services you visited; your     customer service history, and phone number used to call our 800 number.
E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails     more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail     from VS Billing Support. We also compare our customer list to lists     received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages     to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us,     simply send email to customerservice@vsmedia.com .
What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard     drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser     and to provide features such as "What's New".
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent     your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when     you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies     allow you to take full advantage of some of VideoSecrets' coolest services, and     we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Does VS Billing Support Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in    the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only with the    subsidiaries VS Billing Support, controls and as described below.
Agents: We employ other companies and individuals     to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing credit card payments     in real time, sending e-mail notifications or updates, and providing customer     service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions,     but they do not have our authorization to use it for other purposes.
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to     selected groups of VideoSecrets customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do     this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to     receive such offers, please send email     to customerservice@vsmedia.com
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our     business, we might sell or buy sites or assets. In such transactions, customer     information may be one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely     event that VideoSecrets, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer     information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of VS Billing Support and Others: We     release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate     to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements;     or protect the rights, property, or safety of VS Billing Support, our users, or     others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for     fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you     will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will     have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using     Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
We reveal only the last eight digits of your credit card numbers when confirming     an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate     credit card company during order processing.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account     passwords and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared     computer.
What Information Can I Access?
VS Billing Support gives you access to the following information about you    for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.    This list will change as our Web site evolves.
What Choices Do I Have?
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even     though it might be needed to make a purchase.
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the     "What Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, we     usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please send     email to customerservice@vsmedia.com (If you     do not want to receive Terms and Conditions and other legal notices from us,     such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of     VS Billing Support, and it is your responsibility to review them     for changes.)
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent     your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when     you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you     will not be able to use such services as VS Billing Support and other     live shows if you do not use cookies.
