("Google") uses third-party cookies to serve online interest-based advertisements on PublicInfo.Directory. As an important example, Google uses of a cookie known as "DoubleClick" to enable both Google and Google's third party marketing partners to serve advertisements to You based on information gathered during Your use of the Service or Your visit to other websites and services. PublicInfo.Directory may advertise on other third party websites to You after You access the Service. We and third party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, may use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to You based on your use of the Service. Google allows users to customize cookie preferences in Google Ads Settings page. You can also learn more about how to delete or control cookies at www.aboutcookies.org. (c) Ad Serving. PublicInfo.Directory uses third-parties for advertising through the Service and analytics of PublicInfo.Directory users.
