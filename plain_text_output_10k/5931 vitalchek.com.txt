6. Your Choices and Communications Preferences
You can manage your communications preferences when you register with  the Service, by updating your account preferences, by using the “opt-out” or  unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within the communications that  you receive, or by contacting us. We reserve the right to notify you of changes  or updates to the Service whenever necessary.
7. Access to and Accuracy of Your Information
The Service may allow registered users to directly access the  account information they provided and make corrections or updates to that  information upon login at any time. The accuracy of such information is solely  the responsibility of the user.
You may also request access to and correction of other personal  information about you that you have directly provided to us through the  Service. You may also request to review, delete and correct any of that  personal information which is stored and readily accessible for such review  and/or correction, subject to the  LexisNexis  consumer choice policies  and applicable law. For instance, information you provide  for making a payment to a government agency or requesting a vital record may be  transmitted to the appropriate government agency in real time rather than being  stored, and therefore not readily accessible for review or correction.
To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to verify  your identity. The personal information you directly provide us for the  purposes of verifying your identity is typically not stored, but transmitted to  the appropriate government agency directly to process your request, and  therefore not readily accessible for review or correction. We will respond to  your access or deletion request within a reasonable timeframe.
If you request to deactivate your account or delete your personal  information, we will endeavor to fulfill your request in accordance with our  policies but some personal information may persist in backup copies for a  certain period of time and may be retained as necessary for legitimate business  purposes or to comply with our legal obligations.
Access to or correction of personal information that LexisNexis  may gather from public records and other sources is subject to applicable laws  and our  consumer choice policies .

We use a variety of generally accepted administrative, physical and  technical security measures intended to safeguard your personal information.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our  order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure  socket layer technology (SSL) or an industry equivalent.  If you have any questions  about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at vcn_helpdesk@vitalchek.com.

Only as necessary to process your request or facilitate other purposes  described in this privacy policy, your personal information may be transferred  to and stored and processed in countries outside of your country of residence,  which may have different personal data protection rules than in your country.  By using the Service you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of  your personal information to and within facilities located in the United States  and other countries.
