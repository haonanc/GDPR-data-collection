EurekAlert! offers a one-stop science news distribution service you can trust.
EurekAlert!/AAAS is firmly committed to protecting the privacy of its users.
Information Gathered by EurekAlert!/AAAS
EurekAlert! is divided into        two areas:
A public area accessible to anyone with world wide web        resources, and
A restricted area open to registered journalists and        public information officers (PIOs).
EurekAlert!/AAAS gathers two types of information:
Individual data that journalists and PIOs provide when        they register, and
Aggregated data on overall patterns of activity within        the site. Such information enables us to accomodate        our content to users' needs and to help those        organizations that post information to the site to better        understand the demographics of those seeing their        materials.
In general, however, EurekAlert!/AAAS gathers information such        as the date and time of your visit; the URL of the last Web        page you visited; the type of browser and operating system        you're using and your computer's IP address.
EurekAlert!/AAAS does not sell,        rent, trade or give away our list of users.
EurekAlert!/AAAS will not share        information about your individual movement within the site or        any other personal information about you with any third        party. However, as mentioned, we may look at general usage        patterns by user type (public, journalists and PIOs) to help us        improve the site.
Two exceptions:
Information provided on the registration form is shared        with the administrators of journals to which the user        has requested access via EurekAlert!. No other        information is shared. Individual access to journals is        contingent upon the journal administrators of which you        have requested and not by the status of your        registration with EurekAlert!.
The second exception would be in the case of violating        EurekAlert!/AAAS's embargo        policy involving material allegedly obtained via        someone's password-approved access -- and only then in        response to a specific request by the journal or        research institution that submitted the embargoed        document, or by the journalist or PIO in        question. However, EurekAlert!/AAAS reserves the right        to decline any of these requests if there is not        sufficient evidence to support the charge. If we do        agree to provide information related to an alleged        embargo break, only three factors may potentially be        revealed and only to the relevant journal, institution        and/or registered user: whether or not the person viewed        the document for which the embargo was broken; if so,        what time of day he or she viewed it; and whether his or        her request for the file, if made, was successfully        fulfilled. If we do decide to fulfill such a request by        a journal or an institution, the user in question will        be notified.
