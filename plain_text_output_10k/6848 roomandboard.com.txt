Room & Board, Inc. Corporate Consumer Privacy Policy
Room & Board, Inc. is committed to respecting your private information   and protecting it from misuse. Our Privacy Policy outlines our current   policy on personally identifiable information concerning consumers, and   covers the operations of our stores, our catalog and telephone sales,   and within our Web site. We encourage you to read it whenever you visit   our stores, catalogs or Web site, since we may change this policy from   time to time due to enhancements to our systems or changes in the law. A   copy of the current policy is always posted at www.roomandboard.com/privacy/ .    You may also obtain a copy of the current policy by contacting the   office of the Privacy Officer shown at the end of this policy.
By submitting your personal information to us, you are consenting to    the collection and processing of your personal information in the    United States and to our use of your personal information and any    related information in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.    If you are submitting personal information of third parties to us,    you warrant and represent you have their consent to provide their    personal information to us and you will indemnify us and hold us    harmless from and against claims by such individuals relating to our    processing and use of such personal information within the terms of    this Privacy Policy.
Basic Privacy Principles
The following "Basic Privacy Principles" apply throughout our entire   enterprise, whether we gather information through our stores, our   catalog operations, or our Web site.
Room & Board collects the following categories of personally   identifiable information through our Website, our stores, and our   catalog operations: name, address, telephone number, and email address.   We may collect your personally identifiable information across various   devices you may use to access our website, like a mobile device, PC, or   tablet, for example, and from our stores and catalog operations.  You   may submit your credit card or financial account information to complete   a purchase on our web site. While Room & Board does not store or save   credit card or financial account information, it or its third party   vendors use credit card or financial information you provide to process   purchase transaction(s).
We may also obtain information such as name, and we may obtain data such   as image, voice, signature, statements and quotes, stories or anecdotes,   personal or commercial attributes or identifying features, interior or   exterior photographs, videos, or other depictions of premises, home or   office, images of family, friends, or pets, stories, commercial   attributes or identifying features (collectively "Media") from   individuals who send us such material or in connection with agreements   with individuals. We may use Media for any lawful purpose, and Media is   not considered personally identifiable information for purposes of this   Privacy Policy.
We do not consider all information that we may gather or create in   operating our business to be personally identifiable information. If   information is not identity information or directly associated with   identity information, we do not consider it to be personally   identifiable information. For example, a database of our customers'   purchases in aggregate which does not identify the individual customers   would not be personally identifiable information.
We will use your personally identifiable information which we learn   through our interactions with you only for the purposes you would   reasonably anticipate us doing. This includes, but is not limited to,   use to contact you to answer your questions, to fulfill orders, to   obtain billing or payment information, to follow-up on prior orders or   respond to your comments to ensure your satisfaction, and to contact you   with additional information where you have permitted us to do so.
We do not share, sell or trade your personally identifiable information    with third parties, except we may share  some of your personally    identifiable information with third party service providers as specified    below.
We may disclose some of your personally identifiable information to one   or more of our own service providers that we may use to fulfill services   for you.  We will reasonably assure that those service providers are   obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personally   identifiable information, implement and maintain reasonable security   procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information,   to protect the personal information from unauthorized access,   destruction, use, modification, or disclosure, and only use or disclose   it for the purposes we hire them for or law enforcement purposes. You   may also disclose some of your personally identifiable information   directly to one or more of our own service providers that we may use to   fulfill services for you. We will reasonably assure that those service   providers are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your   personally identifiable information, implement and maintain reasonable   security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the   information, to protect the personal information from unauthorized   access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure, and only use or   disclose it for the purposes we hire them for or law enforcement   purposes. If you provide any personally identifiable information to us   as part of a sweepstakes or contest entry, we may disclose such   information to any third party service providers, sponsors or   co-sponsors of the sweepstakes or contest. In that case, when you enter   a contest or sweepstakes, you may become subject to the privacy policy   of these parties in addition to this Privacy Policy. We may also   disclose personally identifiable information to others if we are   required to do so by law, to protect and defend the rights of Room & Board, Inc., or in the event of a corporate sale, merger,   reorganization, dissolution or similar event.
The security of your personally identifiable information is important to   us. Although we cannot guarantee against loss, misuse, alteration,   unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data, we use commercially   reasonable security measures  to protect you from such occurrences. If   necessary in accordance with the law, we will disclose to you any known   or reasonably suspected breach in security involving your personally   identifiable information.
This Privacy Policy is intended to comply with applicable United States   laws and regulations, including the laws of particular states where our   stores or customers are located. Our stores are located in the United   States, all catalog orders are placed to our operators located in the   United States, and our Web site is targeted only to residents of the   United States. If you are not a resident of the United States, please   note that our information gathering practices may not be compliant with   your own country's laws and regulations, and you should not share your   personally identifiable information with us unless you are willing and   able to be subject to United States laws concerning such disclosures.
Store and Catalog Operations
In addition to the Basic Privacy Principles discussed above, the   following policies apply specifically to our Stores and our Catalog   operations.
Our stores and catalog operations are available to you to discuss our   products and services with a Design Associate, and you may place your   orders through one of our Design Associates in the stores, or place a   catalog order via postal mail or via telephone. When we take your order,   we will obtain some of your personally identifiable information   including your payment information. We will only use that personally   identifiable information from your order for purposes concerning the   fulfillment of your order. In doing so, your personally identifiable   information from an order may be used or shared among our different   offices, representatives or service providers such as the store, our   catalog sales offices, our warehouses, our headquarters, the   manufacturers of products you have purchased, the freight carriers used   to deliver products to you, installers or designers we have engaged to   assist with your order, or our credit card merchant banks or other   bankers. We will share only that portion of your personally identifiable   information with third parties that is reasonably required to fulfill   your order, and those third parties will be contractually obligated to   use the personally identifiable information only for order-fulfillment   purposes.
We will comply with our credit card merchant banks' requirements for the   use and storage of your credit card information, such as obligations   concerning the security of your credit card numbers, as well as any laws   that apply to that information's use and storage.
Web Site
In addition to the Basic Privacy Principles discussed above, the   following policies apply specifically to our Web site      ( roomandboard.com ).
Our Web site allows you to shop our catalog and place orders by use of   an e-commerce system that may be provided, in whole or in part, by one   or more third party e-commerce providers. The portions of our Web site   that allow you to place an order by giving your personal information use   industry standard encryption methods such as secure-socket layer   ('HTTPS') technology to protect your information while in transit   between your computer, our computers, and our third party e-commerce   providers' systems. Also, all of your sensitive personal information   (for example your credit card data and your order information) is   encrypted while it is being processed and stored by us and our third   party e-commerce providers. Once your order has been received by us, we   then process and fulfill your order using our normal catalog ordering   system subject to the privacy policies described above. Our third party   e-commerce providers are under contract with us to maintain the   confidentiality and security of your sensitive personal information, and   not to use it for any purpose other than assisting with the transactions   in your own orders.
Our Web site gives you the option to create a personal account. To   create an account, you will be asked to provide contact information and   select a username and password. This personally identifiable information   may be used to provide you with personal services from us. You may also   use the account to use our online personalized features. However, other   than when submitting an order to purchase from our Web site, submitting   contact information and creating an account are strictly voluntary and   are not required to use our Web site. As a way to enhance our ability to   protect your private information, we do not provide you with the ability   to store your credit card (or similar) data on our Web site for future   transactions, and we ask that you re-enter that information each time   you place an order with us.
Our Web site is not targeted to persons under the age of 13, and is not   permitted to be accessed by children under 13. We will not knowingly   collect personally identifiable information from persons under age 13.
Anonymous, non-personally identifiable information such as your IP   address, domain server, type of computer or device, type of web browser,   and addresses of referring site, also known as traffic data, may be   collected and used for web analytics, to approximate a user's location,   monitor fraudulent orders, and to diagnose problems with our server and   administer our site. We may have functionality on our Web site that is   provided, in whole or in part, by a third party service provider. You   can usually identify such third party functionality by the use of a   trademark not owned by Room & Board on or near the functionality. In   that case, when you use the functionality, you become subject to the   terms of use and privacy policy of this third party in addition to the   Privacy Policy and Terms of Use of our Web site. In some cases, you may   need to visit that party's web site and locate the terms of use and   privacy policy. For example, we may use a third party to provide you   with the opportunity to review our products or services or to upload   photographs to our Web site. The reviews and photos you submit may be   publicly posted on our Web site or used for other purposes. We currently   use Olapic, Inc. to provide the photograph upload capability. You may be   required to agree to Olapic's terms of use before you are permitted to   upload a photograph to our Web site. When you upload a photograph to our   Web site, Olapic is storing your photograph and collecting and storing   the information you provide when you upload the photo. For information   about Olapic's privacy practices, please review Olapic's Privacy Policy   located on the www.olapic.com website.
We may also use a third party technology that allows you to chat with   Room & Board representatives via our Web site ("Web Chat"). We currently   use LivePerson, Inc. to provide the Web Chat capability. When you   participate in a Web Chat, LivePerson, Inc. is collecting and storing   your chat data. For information about LivePerson's privacy practices,   please review LivePerson's Technology Privacy Policy (also known as   LivePerson's Customer Website Privacy Policy) located on the www.liveperson.com website.
We may also use cookies, pixel tags, action tags and similar tags to   collect information. A cookie is a small data file that is placed on   your computer when you visit a web site.  A persistent cookie stores   information so when you end a session visiting a web site and return to   the same web site at a later date the cookie information is still   available.  Cookies and tags allow us to compile statistics and other   information about how you use our site. We may use this data to   personalize your Web shopping experience based on your prior visits to   our Web site. We may also use this data to analyze trends and improve   the usability of our site as well as to administer the site and gather   broad demographic statistics. We may also share such non-personally   identifiable information with third parties on an aggregate basis.
In addition, we may use third-party service providers to serve ads on   our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information   about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our   products and services. They may use cookies and other online tools such   as pixel tags, action tags and similar tags to serve ads and personalize   your Web shopping experience based on your prior visits to our Web site.   They may also use information about your visits to our Web site and   other Web sites to target advertisements for products and services. This   anonymous information is collected through the use of a cookie. No   personally identifiable information is collected or used in this   process. These third-party service providers do not know your name,   phone number, address, email address, or any other personally   identifying information about you. If you would like more information   about this practice and to opt out of having this anonymous information   used by our third party service providers, visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-out page .
Our site responds to a web browser's block of persistent cookies by   refraining from using our anonymous cookie.
Our site may contain links to other Internet web sites that we think you   may find of interest. We are not responsible for the content of these   sites, nor do we control, sponsor, endorse or approve them. Your use of   those links is at your own risk.
Sweepstakes
We may offer sweepstakes from time to time. The official rules for our   sweepstakes will be made available on our Web site.  A sweepstakes may   offer furniture for children, but sweepstakes are only open to legal   residents of the United States, excluding Rhode Island, and the District   of Columbia who are at least 18 years old at the time of entry.
By entering into a sweepstakes, you provide your personal information,   including, but not limited to, first and last name, address, city,   state, zip code, and valid email address, to Room & Board and third   parties who are specified in the rules for each sweepstakes, and you   agree to receive communications from Room & Board and such third parties   regarding the sweepstakes you enter. The personal information you   provide to Room & Board will be treated in accordance with this privacy   policy. The personal information you provide to third parties specified   in the sweepstakes rules will be treated in accordance with third   parties' privacy policies. Room & Board is not responsible for third   party's use of information submitted in connection with a sweepstakes.   If you do not agree to Room & Board's Privacy Policy or the privacy   policy of third parties to whom personal information is submitted in   connection with a sweepstakes, then do not enter the sweepstakes and do   not submit your personal information to Room & Board or the applicable   third parties.
Referrals
We offer an option on our Web site for you to refer candidate(s) to us   for consideration for employment. We collect the name, telephone number,   and email address of the person who refers a candidate to us, and the   name, telephone number, and email address of the candidate.
We may choose, but are under no obligation, to contact the referred   candidate via telephone or email. We have no obligation to hire the   referred candidate, and we make no representations about the potential   employment of the referred candidate. If a candidate you referred is   hired, we will contact you to arrange delivery of a gift card at the   telephone number and/or email address you provided in the form on our   Web site that you submitted to refer the candidate to us.  You are   responsible for submitting accurate contact information.
Opting out of Room & Board Communications
We will send you communications, including emails, relating to   completion of purchase transaction(s) such as order confirmation and   shipping information.  If you request to receive promotional advertising   from us either online or by hard copy such as an in store request or by   telephone, you have given us permission to communicate with you about   that promotional advertising either by postal mail, e-mail or telephone.   Further, if you are engaged in transactions with one of our associates,   and choose to use e-mail or telephone for communications about that   transaction, you have given us permission to communicate with you about   that transaction. Separately, we may send you commercial communications   that promote a commercial product or service and may target such   communications based on behavior, geographic location, wish list or cart   activity, for example.  You may opt-out of receiving future commercial   communications from us by following the instructions at the bottom of   each commercial email you receive, or visit the following URL: www.roomandboard.com/unsubscribe/ or  you can also call our Customer Care telephone line at 800.301.9720 to be removed from either our email or postal mail lists.
We love to send you our annual catalog but only if you want it. Because   of that, we've joined Catalog Choice, an organization that lets   consumers indicate which catalogs they no longer wish to receive. If you   would prefer to not receive our catalogs in the postal mail, or if you   are receiving extra copies that you do not need, please visit catalogchoice.org .
