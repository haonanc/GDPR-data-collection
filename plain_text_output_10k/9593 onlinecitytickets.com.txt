Policies and terms of use
The following Policies and Terms of Use ("Terms" or "Agreement") are designed to ensure your understanding of the use of this website ("Site") and your purchase of any ticket listed on this Site. By using or visiting this Site, or purchasing tickets listed on this Site, you expressly agree to abide and be bound by and follow these Terms as well as all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. You represent that you are legally able to enter into this binding contract and if you are under 18, that you are purchasing tickets under the supervision of a parent or guardian. The Terms include the following provisions:
All orders placed on this Site are considered requests until you receive confirmation of the availability of the tickets.
All sales are final; there are no cancellations, returns, or exchanges.
If an event is cancelled, you will be given a full refund. If an event is postponed or rescheduled, your order will not qualify for a refund and your tickets will be valid for the rescheduled date.
Ticket prices may be above the "face value" listed on the ticket (they may also be below the "face value").
Confirmed orders may be filled with comparable or upgraded tickets.
When you purchase a ticket, you receive a 100% Buyer Guarantee, as detailed below.
Processing Services:
The Site utilizes a third party vendor (“VENDOR”), from which it licenses a platform; additionally, VENDOR performs services related to your purchase. These services include, but are not limited to: (i) processing orders, (ii) verifying order details and confirming validity of payment information, (iii) charging your credit or debit card, and (iv) coordinating the delivery of purchased tickets. VENDOR does not design or market the Site and its sole relationship with the Site owner is that of independent contractor. VENDOR and Site shall collectively be referred to as "We" within these Terms.
Ticket Purchase Policy:
Purchasing:
When you find desirable tickets and wish to purchase them, you fill out and submit the information requested on the Site, which constitutes an order. This order is an offer to purchase the tickets. Once you submit the order, you cannot cancel or retract it. Upon the submission of the order, a hold will be placed on your credit or debit card for the funds necessary to purchase these tickets. You will receive an email promptly after you place your order. Neither of these actions complete the sale. Rather, a completed sale is dependent on the seller's acceptance of the order and notice of confirmation to you that the order is accepted. Upon the seller's acceptance of the order, your credit or debit card used in placing the order will be charged. Please note that the price you pay may be higher than the face value of the tickets. A large number of ticket resellers list their tickets on the Site and we are not responsible for typographical errors within the inventory listed for sale. When an error is found in processing your order, you will be notified of the error and provided with available options, including the option of cancelling your order.
Ticket Purchase Policy:
VENDOR reserves the right to replace tickets with comparable or upgraded tickets. When this occurs, we shall be considered to have fulfilled our obligations under these terms. Definitions of "comparable" and "upgraded" are made at the reasonable discretion of VENDOR. Should we fail to deliver any confirmed ticket purchase, our sole obligation or liability shall be limited, unless otherwise required by law, to the return of any payment made by you in relation to the undelivered ticket. We reserve the right to cancel and refund your order at any time for any reason.
Due to the large volume of ticket sellers listing tickets, locations, descriptions and pricing of similar or equal tickets may vary. It is the purchaser's responsibility to verify any possible inconsistency or discrepancy in the ticket location, description and/or price by calling VENDOR at 800-854-2196 before the order is placed.
100% Buyer Guarantee
The 100% Buyer Guarantee means that your transaction will be safe and secure, the tickets shall be delivered prior to the event, the tickets shall be identical, comparable, or better than the tickets you ordered, and the tickets shall be valid and authentic. Your only recourse under the 100% Buyer Guarantee is the return of any payment made in relation to the tickets.
Refund Policy:
All sales are final. A full refund of the purchase price will be given for cancelled events. To qualify for a refund, you must return your tickets as soon as possible, but within ten (10) business days after you receive notice offering you a refund. No refunds will be given without the original tickets, unless otherwise determined by VENDOR in its sole discretion. Postponed or rescheduled events will not be refunded. VENDOR, in its sole discretion, will determine when an event is cancelled.
Event Dates and Times:
Event date, times, venue and subject matter may change. We are not always notified of such changes. It is your responsibility to monitor the event and to confirm any changes to the event with the entity putting on the event. In certain instances, a venue, promoter, or any entity putting on the event will require a ticket holder to relocate his or her seat or otherwise change the seating configuration in a manner beyond our control. We shall not be held responsible for any such change and will not be obligated to provide a refund or any other compensation in the event such a change occurs.
Denial of Admission:
If you have difficulty getting into an event using the ticket you purchased from us, you are required to contact us at 800-854-2196 immediately for assistance. If the problem is not resolved, it is your responsibility to obtain proof from the venue of denied entry. Upon receipt of valid proof that the tickets failed to provide you entry, or if we otherwise determine in our sole discretion that the ticket was invalid, your sole remedy will be to receive a full refund of the cost of the ticket including all fees and delivery charges.
Delivery of Tickets:
In most cases, tickets will be delivered by the method and timeframe designated in the ticket listing. Photo ID may be required to accept delivery. For listings with no designated delivery method, tickets will typically be shipped via our preferred carrier, UPS. Tickets may not ship out immediately. In all cases, VENDOR reserves the right to deliver tickets for any order as late as one (1) hour prior to the event. Valid delivery services on the day of the event may include, in VENDORs sole discretion, Will Call at the venue box office, email (when applicable), courier or pick up at a location outside the venue designated by VENDOR. Delivery designations, such as "e-Tickets" or "Instant Download", do not constitute guarantees of delivery any sooner than the day of the event. Typically such tickets will be delivered as designated. However, in some cases, delivery may first require additional verification or be subject to delays on behalf of the seller. It is your responsibility to contact us if you do not receive tickets within 48 hours of the event. Failure to do so may disqualify you from receiving a refund for any ticket you claim was not delivered, unless failure to receive notice is waived by us in our sole discretion.
Lost, Stolen, or Damaged Tickets
Please keep your tickets in a safe place. We are not responsible for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets and are under no obligation, and, in many instances, are not able, to replace the tickets. Please note that direct sunlight or heat can damage certain types of tickets.
If you would like us to submit a request to the seller for a re-issue of tickets, the reissue fee is 15% of the order total (maximum of $200.00).  If the seller is unable to receive the re-issue of the tickets, you will be refunded the reissue fee.
Payment Options:
As a buyer, you grant VENDOR permission to charge your credit or debit card for the purchase of tickets. Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and PayPal are valid payment methods for purchasing tickets.
Ticket Holder Behavior Policy:
You agree to abide by all rules and policies of the venue, promoter and anyone else responsible for putting on the event. Should you fail to abide by those rules and policies, you shall be subject to all applicable fines and legal or other expenses associated therewith. Further, should any violation result in the loss of the ticket seller's season ticket rights or right to use any other tickets at that venue, or the right to purchase other tickets from that venue, you shall be held liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and losses associated with said loss including, but not limited to, all direct, indirect, vicarious, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages, including lost profits.
Disclaimer:
Neither Site nor VENDOR is the official box office, or affiliated in any way with any venue, promoter, team, league or organizing group. Neither Site nor VENDOR is associated with any official organizer of the events for which tickets are listed. Rather, Site is an independent marketplace for the sale of event tickets on the secondary market and VENDOR is the platform and service provider related to secondary marketplace sales.
Changes in Terms and Conditions:
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms at any time. If we change any term or condition, said modification, revision and additional information shall be posted here and shall automatically replace the terms and conditions and become binding on all users of this site. Your continued use of the site following our posting of revised terms and conditions constitute your acceptance of the revised agreement.
Unlawful Activity:
We prohibit the use of the Site for any unlawful conduct. All users must comply with all local, state, federal and international laws, ordinances and regulations. By using this Site, you agree not to use any false personal information or use an invalid or unauthorized credit or debit card. You agree not to use or permit anyone to use information provided through the Site for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.
Investigations and Consequences:
A purchaser who is the subject of a complaint or whom we believe may have violated these Terms or applicable law will be subject to investigation by VENDOR. You agree to cooperate fully in such investigation including, but not limited to, providing any and all information demanded by VENDOR. If VENDOR finds, in its sole discretion, a user: (a) is unwilling to cooperate with any investigation; (b) has engaged in any illegal, unlawful or fraudulent conduct or otherwise violated these Terms or applicable law or has acted in concert with anyone so engaged; or (c) has provided information that VENDOR is unable to authenticate or verify, VENDOR may take any action it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, canceling orders, issuing a warning, blocking your access to the Site, preventing you from finalizing pending transactions, or exercising any other remedy available to us (including civil, criminal or injunctive redress). You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to us for violations of these Terms and may be difficult to ascertain or calculate and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations.
We reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement authorities or other relevant third parties any activity that either VENDOR or Site believes, in its sole discretion, may in any way violate any local, state, federal or international law.

Arbitration and Dispute Resolution:
You on the one hand and Site and VENDOR on the other hand, each agree that any and all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of or relating to: (i) these Terms; (ii) your use of, or access to, this Site; (iii) Site's and VENDOR's services; or (iv) any tickets or other items sold or purchased through this site shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois, rather than in court. SPECIFICALLY, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS AND CLAIMS TO A TRIAL BY JURY. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. Customer satisfaction is our number one goal. To that end, Site and VENDOR are committed to resolving disputes with its customers in a fair and efficient manner. Prior to commencing any arbitration related to this Agreement, you agree that if you have a dispute with Site or VENDOR, you must first contact our Customer Service Department at 800-854-2196. If our Customer Service Department is unable to achieve a satisfactory resolution, then you must notify us in writing about your claim by sending the accompanying form by certified mail to: OnlineCityTickets.com, 27 N. Wacker Dr. #505, Chicago, IL 60606-2800, Attn: Legal Department. It is important that you provide as much information as possible. Our representative will respond within thirty (30) days of receiving this notice. If the matter is not resolved to your satisfaction, then you agree to begin arbitration by submitting a Demand for Arbitration to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). You further agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any such arbitration shall be Chicago, Illinois. The Demand for Arbitration and the AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org .
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to arbitrate or the Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the state of Illinois. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in a court having jurisdiction thereof.
You can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate. If you do not wish to be bound by this agreement to arbitrate, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access this site. Your written notification must include your name and address, as well as a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Site and/or VENDOR through arbitration. Written notification should be mailed by certified mail to: OnlineCityTickets.com, 27 N. Wacker Dr. #505, Chicago, IL 60606-2800, Attn: Legal Department.
YOU ON THE ONE HAND AND SITE AND/OR VENDOR ON THE OTHER HAND AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNLESS BOTH YOU AND COMPANY AND/OR VENDOR (AS THE CASE MAY BE) ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE WAIVER IS MATERIAL AND ESSENTIAL TO THE ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND IS NON-SEVERABLE FROM THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS. IF THE WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE PARTIES' AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING, SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT TO APPEAL THE LIMITATION OR INVALIDATION OF THE WAIVER. UNLESS YOU AND COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS. ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER VENDOR OR SITE USERS.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement to arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Site and/or VENDOR (whichever is the subject of the arbitration) will pay all filing, administrative and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Site and or VENDOR should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with the Demand for Arbitration. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim you asserted in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse Site or VENDOR, as the case may be, for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Site OR VENDOR.
For transactions involving tickets to events in Illinois, pursuant to 815 ILCS 414/1.5(c), you, VENDOR, and Site may elect to submit complaints against one another to the AAA, under its rules and procedures. Such Complaints shall be decided by an independent arbitrator in accordance with these Terms and you, VENDOR and Site further agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois for complaints involving a ticket event held in Illinois.
