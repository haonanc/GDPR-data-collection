Children Under the Age of 13
Because of our efforts to provide resources to middle school students who are members of the National Junior Forensic League, we allow those students, including those under the age of 13, to register for accounts on our Website.  The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, “COPPA“) require us to inform parents and legal guardians (as used in this section, “parents“) about our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information from children under the age of 13 (“children“). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child’s parent for certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child’s personal information.
This section only applies to children under the age of 13 and supplements the other provisions of this privacy policy. Only the other provisions of this privacy policy apply to teens and adults.
Terms that are defined in the general privacy policy have the same meanings as used in this Privacy Policy for Children Under the Age of 13.
This section notifies parents of:
The types of information we may collect from children:
We require students to provide their name, city, state, and email address during the account registration process. We also request other demographic information, such as gender, race, and GPA but no such information needs to be provided in order for students to register for an account.
How we use the information we collect:
All information is used solely internally. We will aggregate this information to learn more about our members.
With respect to the Website, we use personal information solely for the purpose of website development and maintenance, including but not limited to diagnostic and testing purposes.
Our practices for disclosing that information:
We never provide personal information to third parties for any reason.
We may provide aggregated information to potential sponsors and donors, as part of our case for why they should support the Association. A child will not be personally identified, nor will a child’s individual, disaggregated information be used as part of any such effort without the express written consent of the child’s parent.
Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents’ consent when we collect personal information from children, including how a parent may revoke consent.
A parent can review his or her child’s personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of his or her child’s information. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at info@speechanddebate.org . The parent must provide us with enough information to verify his or her identity and locate his or her child’s account.
