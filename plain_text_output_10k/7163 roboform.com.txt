RoboForm Privacy Policy
PRIVACY POLICY:  Personal data of Customers that purchase RoboForm licenses  is stored on Siber servers in the data center located in USA.  Siber recognizes the GDPR and is fully compliant with its requirements.  Please view our GDPR compliance page for more details: https://www.roboform.com/gdpr The data stored consists of data that customers or their agents  enter into the RoboForm license purchase web page and data collected from Customer's computers  by License Activation and Monitoring.  Customer hereby allows Siber to store such data on Siber's servers. This data shall be used for purchase, refund and chargeback tracking,  activation and reactivation of RoboForm licenses,  and other customer service purposes.  Personal data stored on Siber servers shall not be sent to other companies or individuals, except for cases  when sending of such data is required by Siber business processes  or for enforcement of this License Agreement and  recipient of data is not expected to divulge or misuse received data. For instance, credit card purchases require sending personal Customer data and his credit card data to Credit Card processor and such data sharing shall be allowed under this clause.  Customer allows Siber to send infrequent product  update newsletters and promotional offers to the e-mail and postal addresses stored by Siber, but Customer shall have an option to unsubscribe  from such email newsletters and offers.  Customer also allows Siber to present infrequent offers of Siber and 3rd party software on post-update web page that is shown when user installs new version of RoboForm.   ONLINE LICENSE ACTIVATION AND MONITORING:  Customer hereby agrees to Online License Activation and Monitoring  process for all RoboForm licenses (Pro, Subscription-Based). In this process RoboForm checks the validity of Customer's RoboForm license  by contacting the Siber server at *.roboform.com via the Internet and sending data that uniquely identifies Customer's computer. Customer also agrees that Online Activation and Monitoring  will be  used to enforce provisions of this Agreement.   TRANSMISSION OF DATA IN AUTOUPDATE: RoboForm checks Siber Systems server www.roboform.com (www.siber.com  in older versions) for its new versions approximately once a day.  If it finds a version that is newer than the version that you have,  RoboForm will offer you to upgrade.  The checking of new version results in various data related to computer  and license to be transmitted to Siber server and maybe stored on this server. Customer hereby allows such transmissions to occur.   PERSONAL DATA IN ROBOFORM WITHOUT SYNCHRONIZATION: NO TRANMISSION, NO RECOVERY.  All Password Data that Customer enters into RoboForm is stored only locally on Customer's computer if Customer  does not use option to Synchronize with RoboForm Everywhere. In this case RoboForm does not transmit any Password Data over the Internet.    However, if Customer or a program running on Customer's  computer causes RoboForm to fill an online form with such  personal data, then submission of this form will result in this data being sent over the Internet but  this shall be deemed not to be caused by RoboForm.  Customer agrees that deletion or loss of Password Data entered  into RoboForm  will cause irreversible loss of the said Password Data and Customer accepts the risk of such loss.   PERSONAL DATA IN ROBOFORM WITH SYNCHRONIZATION: DATA TRANSMITTED, RECOVERY POSSIBLE.  If Customer uses Synchronize with RoboForm Everywhere option then Customer Password Data is stored locally on Customer Computer or portable disk  and on RoboForm Everywhere server. If local copy of user data is lost, Customer may obtain  copy of this data from RoboForm Everywhere server.  However, availability of backup copy is NOT guaranteed  by Siber and Siber shall NOT be held liable,  if it cannot produce copy of Customer's RoboForm data. Customer is hereby encouraged to keep multiple copies of  RoboForm user data on his/her computers, disks and devices.  Also in this case RoboForm  shall transmit RoboForm Password Data over the Internet, for the purposes of storing backup copy of  Customer RoboForm Password data on RoboForm Everywhere server and  for purposes of synchronization of said data between Customer computers  and mobile devices. Customer hereby authorizes such transmission.   RoboForm WEB SITE: RoboForm web site may use cookies to track users and Customer agrees to that. RoboForm affiliates and advertisers may also use cookies and Customer agrees to that.  RoboForm Web Site utilizes Google Analytics features,  including Remarketing with Google Analytics,  Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and  Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and  Customer consents to this.
