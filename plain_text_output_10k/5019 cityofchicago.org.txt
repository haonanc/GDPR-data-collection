Legislation and Regulation
Introduction
The City of Chicago is committed to maintaining your online privacy. The City  of Chicago On-Line Privacy Policy applies to data collected from the City of  Chicago website, including all City departments. This Policy does not apply to  the City's sister agencies, including the Chicago Park District, the Chicago  Public Schools, the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), the City Colleges of  Chicago, the Chicago Housing Authority and the Metropolitan Exposition and Pier  Authority.
We do not collect personal information without your permission. Any  information that you volunteer or that we send to you in response is transferred  using industry standard encryption technologies.
The following explains the City's privacy policy for all visitors to the  cityofchicago.org domain.
Information Gathering and Cookies
If you visit our website to read or download information, such as events  schedules, parking forms or building permits, we capture and store only the  domain name of your computer (for example, aol.com) and other related  information to speed up the performance of web page delivery. All information is  deleted from your cache memory when you close the session and leave our site. We  collect no other personal information.
We do not use or set cookies on our website to store any information on your  personal computer hard drive.
A cookie is a very small text file inserted onto your computer by a website  that you visit. When you return to the website, the cookie is then read by the  site's web server. Cookies are used for many things, from making web sites more  personal to tracking your web browsing habits.
On-line Transactions
The City of Chicago currently allows job applicants for vacant City positions  to apply for jobs on-line. The City also allows on-line payment of parking fines  for your convenience. Any information submitted online for these activities is  subject to the same safeguards as if you had engaged in these activities in  person rather than over the Internet.
Sending the City of Chicago Email
We value your feedback. If you send the City an email with questions or  comments about our programs or services, we do collect your email address and  any other information that you volunteer. We do this to improve the content of  our website, and occasionally, to customize its content for the individual user.  We occasionally will share this information with other nonprofit organizations  such as Cook County governmental entities or the Illinois Secretary of State.
Sale of Data
We do not sell data for direct mail or advertising purposes.
