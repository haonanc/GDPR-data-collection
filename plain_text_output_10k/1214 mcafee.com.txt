In order to  keep these products free, we may use information collected through them, such  as what websites you visit or the mobile applications you use, to allow McAfee  and others to show you ads that are targeted to your interests. We do this by  sharing an identifier assigned to your device, together with web browsing  activity or application usage information, with select partners. This  information does not identify you personally and we contractually prohibit the  partners from using the information we provided to identify you. You can opt  out of the use of your information for this purpose in the settings of the  products that include this data sharing.   For more information on which Services contain this feature and how to  opt out, click here .

Children’s Privacy
Some of  McAfee’s Services provide security features that parents may use to monitor  their child’s activity online, physical location, or use of a registered  device. These Services require parental consent, and we do not knowingly use  the Personal Data we collect from children’s devices for any purpose except to  deliver the Services. These products allow parents to delete their child’s  profile at any time. If you believe we have collected information from your  child in error or have questions or concerns about our practices relating to  children, please contact us as described below. If you are under the age of 18,  you must have your parent’s permission to access the Services. McAfee urges  parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names,  addresses, or phone numbers, without parental permission. If you learn that  your child has provided us with Personal Data without your consent, you may  alert us by contacting us as described below. If we learn that we have  collected any Personal Data from children under 13 (and in certain  jurisdictions under the age of 16), we will promptly take steps to delete such  information and terminate the child’s account.
Residents of the European Economic Area
Data Transfers
McAfee  is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations, entities, and  service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we  and our service providers may transfer your Personal Data to, or store or  access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data  protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your  Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in  which we process it. If you are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland,  we provide adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Data to countries  outside of the EEA or Switzerland through a series of intercompany agreements  based on the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under EU law. You are  entitled to obtain a copy of these agreements by contacting us as described  below.
Access,  Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction
If you register  a McAfee Consumer Product, you can access and correct the Personal Data in your  profile at any time by visiting  My  Account .

You may  request access, changes to, or removal of your Personal Data in accordance with  the applicable laws by contacting us as indicated below.  For some requests and where permitted by law,  an administrative fee may be charged.  We  will advise you of any applicable fee prior to performing your request.
Although  McAfee makes good faith efforts to provide customers with access to their  Personal Data, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide  access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal  privilege, where the information would compromise others’ privacy or other  legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be  disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in  question, or where it is commercially proprietary. If McAfee determines that  access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you  with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point  for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially  reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making  any changes to your Personal Data.
