iContact Privacy Policy
This “Privacy Policy” is incorporated by reference in iContact LLC’s End User Service Agreement (“EUSA”) and its Terms of Use, posted at  www.icontact.com . We have created this Privacy Policy to reflect our firm commitment to your privacy and the protection of your personal data. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit www.icontact.com . (“Site”) and when you use our services, as well as information collected from other sources, such as information you provide at tradeshows or seminars or to our business partners. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.
Generally, we collect or maintain the following categories of data:
Customer Registration Data: when a customer, whether an individual or an entity, activates our services, creates an account at the Site or registers at an event we collect account information from that customer, which we refer to in this Policy as “Customer Registration Data.” The Customer Registration Data we collect includes individual or contact name, company name, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, as well as information about services requested and payment information, such as credit card number, expiration date and billing address. We also assign customers a unique username and password to access their account information through the Site;
Customer Message Recipient Data: we also maintain data that has been provided to us or uploaded to the Site by our customers, which we refer to in this Policy as “Customer Message Recipient Data.” Typically, Customer Message Recipient Data relates to individuals or entities who have opted in to receive email messages or other types of communications from our customers, and may include name, e-mail address, contact information, and other information. Under our Anti-Spam Policy , customers must obtain a recipient’s consent prior to sending the recipient an e-mail through our service. For more information, please see the section below entitled “ Why Do You Receive Marketing Communications .” We only use Customer Message Recipient Data on behalf of and under the instructions of our Customers. We do not use Customer Message Recipient Data for our own marketing purposes;
Site Data: we use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to automatically collect information about visitors to our Site and users of our services, which we refer to in this Policy as “Site Data.” The Site Data we collect includes browser type, operating system and IP address, as well as information of the web pages viewed and links clicked by visitors and/or customers. We may combine Site Data with other data we have collected from users, such as Customer Registration Data; and
Other Data: We may also collect information about customers or potential customers from our affiliates, from third parties, such as business partners, from our social media pages, during promotional events or from users who submit their information to iContact in order to subscribe to our mailing lists or receive information about iContact products and services.
Although the majority of our customers are businesses, some of the Customer Registration Data submitted or maintained by us may identify or relate to an individual (“personal data“), rather than a business. We will use such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
How Do We Use the Data We Collect?
We may use the information we collect and maintain, including any personal data, for the following purposes:
If you have provided your contact information to us, we may use such information to contact you for marketing and promotional purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone. To learn how to opt out of receiving marketing communications from us, please go to the section below entitled “ How Can You Stop Receiving Marketing Communications? “
To process orders, requests and payments, and to communicate with our customers about their accounts or any requests, orders or payments;
To provide requested services to our customers, including sending or facilitating the delivery of emails on behalf of and at the request of our customers. (In such cases, our customers are responsible for the content and delivery of such communications.)
To respond to any inquiries submitted to us and to provide technical support to customers and Site visitors.
To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to customers or Site visitors, and to otherwise personalize experiences at the Site;

To better understand how users access and use our Site and services, both on an aggregate and individualized basis, for the purposes of improving our Site and services and responding to customer and visitor desires and preferences; and
To detect violations of applicable policies. For example, we may use automated filters to screen the content of e-mails sent by or on behalf of our customers in order to restrict the sending of pornography or other prohibited content. We may also track or screen certain e-mail activities, such as the importation of large e-mail lists or the receipt of returned e-mails, to detect and prevent illegal spamming activities.

We do not sell, rent or trade personal data, whether Customer Information or Customer Recipient Data, without prior consent.

Why Do You Receive Marketing Communications?
If you received one or more marketing or promotional e-mails, such as a newsletter (“commercial e-mails”) from us, it means that (a) your email address is on our list of customers, trial users, or prospective customers; or (b) you have provided us your email address so that we could contact you. If you believe you received an email from us in error, please contact us immediately at customercare@icontact.com .
Our customers also use iContact’s service to send commercial e-mails to users who have opted-in to receive such e-mails. According to iContact’s Anti-Spam Policy , our customers are not permitted to send unsolicited marketing or promotional e-mails, and are required to obtain opt-in consent from a recipient, prior to sending a commercial e-mail to the recipient’s e-mail address. While we have a strict Anti-Spam Policy, we cannot guarantee that our customers will always honor such policy.

Additional Information
Referrals. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. iContact does store this referral email address for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and we may use a third party to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at customercare@icontact.com to request that we remove this information from our database.
Import Contacts. iContact offers a variety of means to import contacts. One-at-a-time import provides the user with the ability to add a single contact and to fill out that contact’s information, one field at a time. A user also is able to upload a single contact in the form of a .vcf ( VCard) file, which can be retrieved from an email client, such as Microsoft Outlook. Bulk contact upload can be done in two different ways. If a user is simply adding email addresses, they can copy and paste them from a program, such as Notepad. Alternatively, if a user wants to upload many contacts with various amounts of subscriber data, iContact supports the upload of both .xls and .csv files. The imported contact information will only be used for the sole purpose of utilizing the iContact services.
Single Sign-On. With certain social media sites, you can choose to log in to our site using single sign-on. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal data with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. These services may give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
Social Media Widgets. Our Web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
The majority of our customers are businesses; however, some the information we collect about customers and potential customers may identify or relate to an individual, rather than a business. We will use such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may send marketing communications to our customers and potential customers, and we may also allow our affiliated companies to send marketing communications to our customers and potential customers; you may opt out of receiving marketing communications from us and from our affiliated companies by emailing us at customercare@icontact.com .
We may also receive personal data about individual Customer Message Recipients (defined above), from or on behalf of iContact’s customers. We process personal data about Customer Message Recipients only on behalf of and under the direction of our customers, and the collection, use and disclosure of such data is subject to the customer’s privacy policy, not this one.
What About Children Under 13?
Our Site and services are not intended to be used by children under 13 years old. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will remove it from our systems immediately.
How Will We Notify You of Privacy Policy Changes?

iContact LLC participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.
iContact LLC is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. iContact LLC complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, iContact LLC is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, iContact LLC may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
1. SCOPE OF POLICY
This Policy applies only to the processing of Personal Data (defined below) that iContact receives in the United States from its European Customers (defined below). Most iContact Customers are businesses, not individuals. However, iContact may also receive Personal Data about individual Message Recipients (defined below) on a Customer’s e-mail marketing or contact lists. We process the Personal Data of a Customer’s Message Recipients only on behalf of and under the direction of the Customer, and the collection, use and disclosure of such data is subject to the Customer’s privacy policy.
This Policy does not cover data through which individuals are no longer identifiable, or identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost or labor, or data combined with pseudonyms rather than actual names or other identifiable information.
Capitalized terms in this Policy are defined at the end of this Policy.
2. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA
iContact may collect Personal Data: (1) directly or indirectly from Customers; (2) from Third Parties; (3) from iContact affiliates in Europe, or (4) through other means. We also collect information in the course of conducting our business operations or in furtherance of our legitimate business interests that may lead to the incidental collection of Personal Data.
iContact uses Personal Data for legitimate business purposes, including: (1) to process orders and for billing purposes; (2) to provide our services to Customers, including facilitating the delivery of e-mails or other communications to a Customer’s Message Recipients; (3) to provide technical support or customer service; (4) to respond to Customer inquiries or to otherwise communicate with customers about their iContact accounts, orders or services; (5) to assess and improve the quality of our website, products, services and business operations; (6) to create reports and track the effectiveness of Customer campaigns and iContact services; (7) to analyze and improve our website and services; (8) to satisfy governmental reporting and tax requirements; (9) to satisfy security, health, and safety concerns; (10) to plan and implement potential acquisitions and mergers; (11) for other business-related purposes permitted or required under applicable local laws and regulations; and (12) for other purposes expressly consented to by Data Subjects.
Where permitted, iContact also may use the Personal Data we collect to contact our Customers about services and other information that we believe will be of interest or to send marketing information. Our Customers may opt-out of being contacted for such purposes by e-mailing customercare@icontact.com .
3. DISCLOSURES/ONWARD TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA
Except as otherwise provided herein, iContact discloses Personal Data only to Third Parties who reasonably need to know such data for a legitimate business purpose of iContact’s. Such recipients must agree to abide by confidentiality obligations.
The disclosure of a Customer’s Message Recipient Personal Data is subject to the Customer’s Privacy Policy. iContact will not use or disclose such Personal Data other than as directed by the Customer.
4. SENSITIVE DATA
iContact does not intentionally collect Sensitive Data from Customers. Except as stated otherwise herein, iContact will not disclose Sensitive Data to any Third Parties, other than its service providers as stated above, unless it receives a Data Subject’s express consent. Further, iContact will not use Sensitive Data for any purpose other than: (1) the purpose for which it was originally provided, (2) a purpose expressly consented to by the Data Subject; or (3) a purpose expressly described below.
Notwithstanding the above, should iContact receive Sensitive Data, it may disclose Sensitive Data (and Personal Data) without prior express consent, where such disclosure or use: (a) is in the vital interests of the Customer, or another person; (b) is necessary for the establishment of legal claims or defenses, to obtain legal advice, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending iContact’s legal rights; (c) is required to provide medical care or diagnosis; (d) is necessary to carry out iContact’s obligations under applicable employment or other laws; (e) is data manifestly made public by the Customer; or (f) as otherwise required by law.
5. DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY
iContact uses reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and integrity of Personal Data and to update it as appropriate. iContact also uses reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data that we collect or maintain. For example, all electronically stored Personal Data is stored on a secure network with monitored firewall protection, and access to iContact’s electronic information systems requires user authentication via password or similar means. Despite these precautions, no data security safeguards guarantee 100% security all of the time.
6. RIGHT TO ACCESS, CHANGE OR DELETE PERSONAL DATA
Upon reasonable request and to the extent the request does not compromise the protections set forth in this Policy, iContact allows Customers reasonable access to their own Personal Data. Data Subject’s may request that iContact correct, amend or delete such data where it is inaccurate. iContact will grant such requests, except where doing so would cause unreasonable burden or expense, or pose a risk to such individual’s privacy. If you wish to access, change, or delete your Personal Data held by iContact, please e-mail customercare@icontact.com . iContact will endeavor to respond in a timely manner to all reasonable requests.
7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
This Policy may be amended from time to time, consistent with applicable data protection and privacy laws and principles. We will notify you if we make changes that materially affect the way we handle your Personal Data previously collected, and allow you to opt-out of having your Personal Data used in any materially different manner.
