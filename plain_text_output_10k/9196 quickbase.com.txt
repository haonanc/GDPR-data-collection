Third Party Service Providers. We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in providing the Quick Base service to you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. The contracts outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit third parties from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they’ve been contracted. Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them.
Legal Disclosures. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, to enforce or apply our Terms of Service, available at http://www.QuickBase.com/terms... and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Quick Base, users of our service, or others. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or a law enforcement request.
Business Partners. We have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. Partner services and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. This Web site may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers.
