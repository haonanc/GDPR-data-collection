We may also acquire information about you from third parties with whom we have a relationship or otherwise contract with to obtain such information. Further, in the event we acquire a business, we may receive information from the seller of such business. Additionally, we may receive information from various consumer reporting agencies and related service providers. 
We also work with third-party service providers that provide us feedback about our Websites and analytics and general information about browsing patterns to improve our Websites and our Internet Marketing Channels. Analytics services such as Site Catalyst by Adobe Analytics provide services that analyze information regarding your visits to our Websites and may use cookies, web beacons and other tracking mechanisms (as described below) to collect this information.

When you visit our Websites or interact with us through your computer or mobile device, (including if you utilize or interact with our Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other technologies within our stores) we may collect "Automated Information" through Cookies, Web Beacons and other similar or related automated means (collectively, "Information Technologies"). "Cookies" are small text files sent to your device as you visit our Websites or utilize our Internet Marketing Channels and saved on your device via your browser or hard drive.

In addition, while Automated Information does not generally identify or relate to you as an individual, we may associate these types of information with you as an individual. In addition, others might seek to do so, and we cannot guarantee that parties with whom we may share such information might not succeed in re-identifying or associating non-personal information with particular individuals; we cannot be responsible for such parties’ use of such information.
Mobile Fitness Application Information. If you link your electronic fitness account which you have with a third party (such as Garmin, MapMyRun, Move, or Fitbit or any other third party that provides tracking services) to any DICK’S Family of Businesses’ account, you understand that such third party will share your information with us and our use of such information is governed by this Policy as well as the applicable privacy policy of the third-party tracking device company.
Social Media Access. Dick’s engages with its current and prospective customers on multiple Internet Marketing Channels/social media services (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter). If you contact us on one of our Internet Marketing Channels, request customer service via social media or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this Policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use. In addition, if you choose to access, link to, or log-in to our Websites or Internet Marketing Channels or otherwise communicate with us through a third-party social media service, you are granting us permission to access and use the information that you post or store on the applicable social media service in accordance with the privacy policy of that service and the privacy settings that are applicable to your account, and to store the user name and password you use to log-in to the applicable social media service.

We do not control, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices of such services. You should consult the privacy policy of such services for additional information.
In-Store Services.
In-Store Technology.   Many Dick’s store locations offer free Wi-Fi services to visitors. Wi-Fi routers capture certain data from your devices that interact with the router. We also may enable Bluetooth or other technologies in our stores which enable us to detect the presence of your device in our store or provide operational insights.  Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.
Video Cameras.   We use cameras in our stores for security, operational and marketing purposes. This technology may capture demographic and personal information about you.
Third Party Applications.   Some third party service providers (such as Google) are able to combine your search history or other activity with the location functions within your device, to know that the same device that was used for searching on-line has also been at our store.  These service providers provide us aggregate information as to how internet searches translate to customer store visits or other information.

If you choose to create an account on one of our team sports or event Websites we host on behalf of a national, state or local sports governing body, league, club, team, or other organization (each, an “Organization”), or participate in an Organization that maintains an account or uses any such Website, you are granting us permission to share your information with such Organization and its affiliates and acknowledge that such Organization may share your information, including Personal Information, and content with others including publicly.

Some of these networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) or participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program. To learn more about your choices relating to members of the NAI visit their website at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed .

In addition, the browser on your device may offer you preferences regarding a website's collection of your information or your online activities over time and/or across different websites or online services. At this time, our Websites do not respond to these preferences, and our Websites may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Policy.

If you have linked your electronic fitness account with a third party to a DICK’S mobile application, and you no longer want DICK’S to collect data from that electronic fitness account, you will need to disconnect that account from within the DICK’S application. Once that is done, you should uninstall the application from your mobile device.
