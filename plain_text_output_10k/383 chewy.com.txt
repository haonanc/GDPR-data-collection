COOKIES AND INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING
Tracking tools we use.  We and our service providers collect information about users over time and across different websites and devices through the    use of tracking tools including cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other online information-gathering tools (collectively, "cookies").    While the cookies that we use may change from time to time, we use cookies for the same purposes, including:
To authenticate your account and store your password if you are a registered account holder;
To monitor performance of our Services;
To learn more about the way you interact with our content;
To personalize your experience on our Sites, Apps and Social Media Services;
To optimize and tailor our Sites and Apps;
To make product recommendations and provide you with advertising content on our Services and elsewhere in which we think you will be interested;
To measure the effectiveness of personalized ads;
To pursue analytics and research to help us improve our Services and product offerings;
To better understand our Site visitors and App users and their respective interests, including by learning about your online activities across devices.
Interest based advertising. We and our service providers use cookies to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other    actions you take on our Sites, Apps and other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads on both Chewy-owned and operated    sites and unaffiliated sites. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information    from activities such as purchasing on our Sites or Apps, visiting sites that contain our content or ads, interacting with our tools or using our payment    services.  In providing interest-based ads, we follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital    Advertising Alliance (DAA) (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).  See "Advertising Preferences and    Opt-out" below to opt-out of such advertising.
Third party advertising management partners may help us display tailored content to our customers' interests and serve interest-based advertising on    our behalf.  We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers    and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may collect information through    cookies about your browsing activity on our website to display interest based ads.  Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you    (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more    relevant and useful advertising.
Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites directly to your browser. They    automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad    content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third- party sites may use, and the information    practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information    about their privacy practices.
ADVERTISING PREFERENCES AND OPT-OUT
Cookies: The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you    when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  If you set your browser to limit or remove cookies or otherwise block our use    of cookies, some Site features may be unavailable or unable to function properly. Your device may not give you the ability to control cookies.    If you wish to block cookies on our App, you will need to delete the application from your mobile device.
Email marketing opt-out: If you wish to opt-out of any marketing email communications you may contact our customer service representatives at the    phone number or email address below, under Questions.  You also may follow opt-out unsubscribe instructions included in our promotional e-mail.    Please note that removal of user information from our database or "opting-out" will not stop marketing or advertising content that is generated    for distribution or is otherwise queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can implement your request. Following receipt of a    request from you, we will take reasonable steps to delete your information.  If you opt-out of marketing communications, you will continue to    receive transactional communications, such as e-mail or text notifications about your order status, recall information and other administrative    information.  Your information will remain in our database, but will be marked as inactive so you do not receive marketing materials from us.
Interest-based advertising opt-out:  You may opt-out of our targeted advertising and the targeted advertising of certain providers by visiting the    DAA consumer opt-out page at https://www.aboutads.info/choices .  Also, you can generally opt-out of receiving    personalized ads from member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) by visiting the NAI consumer opt-out page at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/ . Opting out will not mean    that you will no longer receive our ads, rather, it just means that those ads will not be targeted to you based upon data collected from you on    our online Services.
Apps opt-out:  You may use the DAA's AppChoices program to opt-out of certain interest-based advertising in    apps (see: https://youradchoices.com/appchoices).  You may also select a system level advertising preference feature on your device to opt out your    device from interest-based advertising in apps.  On Apple iOS devices, system level advertising preference may be accessed via Settings – Privacy –    Advertising – Limit Ad Tracking.  On Android devices, open the Google Settings app from your app drawer or from your operating system's settings    menu, tap Ads, and select "Opt-out of Interest-based ads.
Facebook opt-out:  Facebook may provide you with the ability to opt-out of certain advertising practices.    See https://www.facebook.com/help/1075880512458213/?helpref=hc_fnav .    However, we are unable to control Facebook's practices or disclosures. To opt-out of data collection by other Social Media Services, you should review    that provider's privacy practices.
Mobile location settings:  If you access our Services through a mobile device, we may also be able to identify the location of your mobile device.    You may choose not to share your location details with us by adjusting your mobile device's location services settings. For instructions on changing    the relevant settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.
Do-Not-Track:  Some browsers have a "do not track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.    Our online Services do not support "do not track" preferences that may be available in your browser and are not capable of satisfying the preference    you set.
DATA SECURITY
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the information we collect. However, no information    system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
DATA RETENTION
We may retain your data for as long as we believe there is a business, legal or security reason for doing so, even if you are no longer an active    customer.

You may correct or update information collected about you through our Services by contacting us at the email address noted at the end of this Privacy    Policy below, or by editing your information and preferences on the "Your Account" and "Profile and Password" pages.
