When registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, or other information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.
Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites. Please refer to the "Do we use 'cookies'?" section below for information about cookies and how we use them.
How do we use your information?

To administer a survey or other site feature.
 
How do we protect visitor information?
 
 
Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

The term "outside parties" does not include Daniel Kern, Inc. It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.
However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

Subscribe & Save Terms & Conditions
Welcome to the terms and conditions ("Terms") for our Subscribe & Save subscription ordering program ("Subscribe & Save").
These Terms are between you and Acne.org and/or its affiliates ("Acne.org", "we" or "us"), and govern our respective rights and obligations. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Acne.org related to Subscribe & Save. Please note that your use of the Acne.org website is also governed by our Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on the Acne.org website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms.

Benefits
The Subscribe & Save benefits discussed on the Subscribe & Save details page and Frequently Asked Questions page are part of these Terms. Acne.org reserves the right to change the Subscribe & Save benefits, including the discount amounts and the eligibility used to determine discount amounts, at any time in its sole discretion. All changes will apply to future orders, regardless of whether you have a current subscription.
Your participation in the Subscribe & Save is personal to you, and you may not assign or transfer your Subscription or any of the benefits to any third party without our authorization.
If any problems arise with your Acne.org account, the shipping address or payment method associated with your Subscription order that we are unable to resolve, we will notify you via e-mail using the address associated with your Subscription asking that you resolve the problem and reactivate your Subscription. Your Subscription will be placed on hold and no additional orders will be processed or shipped until the problem has been resolved and the Subscription has been reactivated. Subscribe & Save discounts and any Subscribe & Save limited time special Subscription promotions in effect apply only to eligible items displaying the offer message on the Subscribe & Save item information pages and by selecting the Subscribe & Save delivery method.
All returns under the Subscribe & Save are subject to the Acne.org Returns policy. Subscriptions are good while supplies last or until the Subscribe & Save discount on a particular item is canceled. Subscribe & Save Subscriptions are void where prohibited.
Payment; Renewal
The total cost charged to your credit card for each Subscribe & Save order will be the cost of the item on the day the order is processed less the Subscribe & Save discount, plus any applicable sales tax. Any Acne.org gift certificates or eligible promotional code balances on your Acne.org customer account will be applied toward the balance of your order before charging any remaining balance to your credit card.
Valid credit cards are the only payment method accepted to create Subscribe & Save subscriptions. Do not sign up for a Subscribe & Save subscription with a debit card. Also known as a "check" or "ATM" card, a debit card typically has the word "debit" printed on the face of the card. MasterCard uses a unique debit hologram above the MasterCard logo. Visa identifies its debit cards as check cards and prints the word debit above the Visa logo.
Gift cards and promotional credits on your account will be applied to existing subscriptions before your credit card is charged.
The charge for each Subscribe & Save item shipment will be billed to the credit card used to create your subscription or as otherwise directed by you. If we are unable to complete your Subscribe & Save order with the credit card you used to create your subscription, you authorize us to update your subscription with another credit card in your account and to charge the credit card for your Subscribe & Save order.
Your Subscription will remain in effect until it is cancelled. If you cancel your Subscription and then reactivate it, the discount applied to any Subscribe & Save item may not be the same discount in effect at the time of cancellation. If the Subscribe & Save discount percentage for such Subscribe & Save item changes, the new discount will be applied to your future shipments of that item. Special limited time subscription promotions only apply during their effective dates.
Agreement Changes
We may, in our sole discretion, change these Terms and Conditions, Acne.org's general Conditions of Use, Privacy Notice, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on the Acne.org website, without notice to you. If any change to these terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions. YOUR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Termination by Us
We may, in our sole discretion, terminate your subscriptions at any time without notice. If we do so, you will only be charged for orders that have been shipped to you.
