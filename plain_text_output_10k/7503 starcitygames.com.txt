Collection of Personal Information
We may ask you for information that personally identifies you (“personal information”) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or carry out a transaction that you have requested.

This information is used, among other reasons, to help improve the Site, analyze use trends and administer the Site.
Use of Personal Information
Except as otherwise required by law, the personal information collected on the Site will be used solely to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) and/or product(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.
