The CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS® ("C.A.R.") has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and so that you, as a visitor to C.A.R. Online ("Web site"), will be aware of the uses made of information that may be generated as a result of you using our Web site.
What information is generated when you visit C.A.R. Online?
Depending on how you use our Web site, certain types of personal and nonpersonal information may be generated and collected.  For example, you may give us your name or e-mail address when you complete a registration screen, respond to a questionnaire or submit an e-mail to us.  Any personal information that you provide to us will be used by us primarily to fulfill the stated objective for which the information was requested or collected (e.g. if information is provided as a result of you e-mailing us, we will use the information provided, such as e-mail address, to respond to you).
Other types of information that may be generated and collected when you use our Web site is information that we consider nonpersonal in nature.  For example, we may collect the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account); the date and time you access our site or and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site.  We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our Web site and to help us make our Web site more useful to visitors.
Use of Cookies
What is a cookie?  A cookie is a data file that is created and stored on your computer's hard drive when you visit a Web site.  The typical purposes of a cookie is to make your use of the Web site easier and more convenient and to assist the Web site in tracking your use of the site.  For example, a cookie may save the registration information, passwords, purchases or preferences that you create when using a Web site so you don't have to reenter this information.  Cookies may also tell the Web site which areas of the site are popular and which aren't.  Cookie technology is used by most major Web sites and is considered an industry standard for the Internet.
Our Web site uses cookie technology to verify user information.  (Please see the section titled 'Advertisements' for more information concerning advertisers.).  Also, most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  If you prefer, you may set your browser so that it refuses cookies or alerts you when cookies are being created on your hard drive.  You should be aware though that by not accepting cookies, you may impair your ability to use certain shopping or password protected areas of web sites.
REALTOR® Directory
C.A.R. is a private trade association consisting of real estate professionals.   As one of the many benefits of membership with C.A.R., we make available on our Web site a searchable database of our members called the "REALTOR® Directory."  The directory can be used by the public to locate and contact our members by such characteristics as name, company or city location. 
The member information made available through the REALTOR® Directory is intended to contain only the business information of our members.   Under no circumstances will we intentionally display or make available on our Web site the personal home addresses or phone numbers of our members. 
If you are a member of C.A.R. and would like to be removed from the REALTOR® Directory, please see the section called "Choice/Opt Out."  If you have corrections or updates to the Directory, please see the section called "Corrections/Updates."
Directors and Committee Members
For use by the members of C.A.R., we make available on the Web site the names of members who are serving as directors or committee members of C.A.R.
"Contact Us" Feature
Like most sites on the Internet, our Web site contains a feature that allows you to contact us with your comments or questions.   Not surprisingly, we call this feature "Contact Us."  To use this feature, there is an icon at the top of each page on our Web site which you can click onto.  When you do click this icon, a screen will prompt you to provide us with certain information, such as your first and last name, email address, phone and fax number and your address, including your city and state. 
The information collected through the "Contact Us" feature is used to investigate and respond to your inquiries.  If you are a member, we may also use the information you provide to update our membership records.
C.A.R. Online Product Mall
The C.A.R. Online Product Mall is an area on our Web site where you can purchase various real estate related products.   In order to process and complete your orders though the Mall, we will need to ask you for certain information, such as your name, company name, address, state and zip code.  We also need to ask you for your credit card number and expiration date. 
The information collected through the C.A.R. Online Product Mall is used to process your order and may also be used to keep track of the amount and types of purchases being made through the C.A.R. Online Product Mall.  We may also use your email address or mailing address to send you information regarding updates to the products you purchased or new products which may be of interest to you.  When you click on the Product Mall icon, you may be taken to another Web site where you may purchase products, and if so, you agree to be taken to and bound by the terms of that Web site?s privacy policy.
With respect to your credit card information, this information is sent encrypted to a secure server.  The information is then used to complete your purchase order.  Please see the section called "Security" for more information about the security of our Web site.
Links to Other Sites
In many areas of our Web site, we have included links to other Internet sites which we feel add to or improve the quality of our Web site.   While we hope you find these links helpful, we cannot assume responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of any linked site.  Therefore, we encourage you to investigate and determine the privacy policy and practices of any linked site prior to providing information to the linked site. 
Consumer Newsletter Service
We currently offer as a free service to our members a "Consumer Newsletter Service."  Through this service, our members can send a customized electronic newsletter to clients and customers, which includes pertinent real estate related information as well as a photo of the member and his or her business contact information.  To provide this service, we have retained Inman News Features to provide the content and technical support.
To sign up for the Customer Newsletter Service, we ask you to provide certain information, such as your name, phone number, business postal and email addresses and your web site address (if you have one).   In addition, you can submit the names and email address of your clients and customers which you want to be subscribers of the service. 
Under no circumstances will the information provided you when signing up for the Customer Newsletter Service, including the names and email address of clients and customers, be used for any purpose other than to perform the Customer Newsletter Service. 
Surveys
We may from time to time create and use surveys on our Web site.  Most surveys are simple ?click box? surveys where you click a box on the screen to indicate your response.  However, we may from time to time ask you for your name, email address or demographic information.  If a survey does ask you this information, we will use the information to complete the survey, compile statistics and update member records.
Contests
We may from time to time run contests on our Web site.  If our contests require you to provide personal or demographic information, we will use this information primarily to complete the contest and update member records.
Advertisements
Like many other sites on the Internet, we sell advertising space on our Web site to other companies.  The advertising space we sell is usually in the form of an electronic "advertisement banner."  An advertisement banner is essentially a graphic link to the actual Internet site of the advertiser.
While we hope you find our advertiser's products helpful, we cannot assume any responsibility for the privacy practices of our advertisers.  Therefore, like any other Internet site you may visit, we encourage you to become knowledgeable of the privacy policies and practices of our advertisers prior to providing information on their sites. 
Public Chat Rooms or Forums
From time to time a discussion forum, bulletin board, blog, chat area, news group, community, or other feature designed so that Users may upload data and images or communicate with others ("Forum") may be made available to Users on this Site. C.A.R., in its sole discretion, reserves the right to review, control or edit any text, data, images, files, or other materials that may be uploaded, posted or submitted in any Forum ("Submissions") as well as the right to refuse to post any such Submission.  All Submissions are subject to the Terms of Use.  Please remember that any information you disclose on these types of features will be accessible to the public and you should exercise caution prior to disclosing any personal information on these features.
C.A.R. Toolbar
C.A.R. will not collect any information from you that could identify you personally when you download, install, and use the C.A.R. Toolbar. The C.A.R. Toolbar will not track your searches or browsing habits, and it will not install any other software programs on your computer without your consent.  We will not gather information from the C.A.R. Toolbar to send any marketing or promotional materials to you, or to communicate with you by phone, fax or e-mail without your consent.  C.A.R. may collect non-personal information concerning how many times the C.A.R. Toolbar download link was accessed and how many times the C.A.R. Toolbar was downloaded for internal business and statistical purposes.
Required by Law
We may disclose information provided by you if we are legally required to do so, such as by court order or subpoena.
Security
We have adopted what we consider to be reasonable security measures to protect against the loss, theft, misuse and alteration of information collected through our Web site.  However, if you are concerned about the security of the Internet or our Web site, we suggest that you not provide this information.
Other Products and Services
Although we generally collect and use information to fulfill the stated objective for which the information was requested or collected, we may also provide the information to our subsidiaries so that they may send you information regarding other products or services that may be valuable or interesting to you.
