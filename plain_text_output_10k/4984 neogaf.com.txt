Disclosure
We may provide your personal data and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you for their use solely to provide us with such assistance. For example, we may use a third party payment processor to process your payments. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personal data or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processors. Unless we give you the choice to opt-out and you do not exercise your opt-out right, Neo4j’s service providers do not have any right to use personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will not disclose your sensitive or other personal data to a third party unless you have provided us with affirmative or explicit (opt in) consent. If you use our Neo4j Browser Sync service, we use Auth0 to authenticate you and any information that you save in our Neo4j Browser Sync service will be hosted by our service provider Firebase. Firebase’s use of your information is subject to Firebase’s policies at https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html .
We will also disclose your personal data (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Neo4j Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services.

The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which Neo4j does not have control (“External Web Sites”).  For example, our pages at Slack, Google Groups, and Stackoverflow are External Web Sites. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Neo4j of those External Web Sites.

The third party social plugin may set a cookie when your browser creates a connection to the servers of such social networks and the plugin may transmit your data to the social networks. 
Additionally, there may be places where we offer the ability for Neo4j applications to connect with third party social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook.  We will collect certain data that the third party social networks provide to us and we will only use that data to provide the application for your use. Your use of these social plugins is subject to the privacy policies of the third party social networks.
Retaining your personal data
We keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purposes for which it was collected. Where we keep your data for purposes beyond those of our contractual fulfilment, we keep the data only as long as necessary and/or mandated by law for the respective purpose.
When we decide how long we will keep your information we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, why we need it, and any relevant legal requirements.
We may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely.
Security
We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personal data from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Neo4j may use secure socket layer and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personal data. The security of the Neo4j Browser Sync service is provided by our cloud hosting provider, Firebase and you can read more about Firebase’s security policies at https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html .
