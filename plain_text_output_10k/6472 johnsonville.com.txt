Collecting Information
Johnsonville only collects personal information that is willingly provided, and then, only to provide our customers with the best possible product and experience.

We never share your personal information or use it for purposes other than what it was originally given to us and with those third party providers that are required to complete your purchase. We do believe you have a right to know about information that we collect, and how we use it.
