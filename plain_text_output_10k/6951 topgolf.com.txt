Links to Other Sites
This Site provides links to websites not operated by Topgolf, including our suppliers or partners. Topgolf requires that its suppliers take steps to keep your personal information confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Topgolf assumes no responsibility for third party websites, including but not limited to the privacy practices of these third party sites.

Cross-Border Data Transfers
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personal information will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. Where permitted by applicable law, by submitting your personal information to this Site and Locations, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the United States. We take steps to securely maintain personal information transferred to the United States.
Other Issues
What is the legal basis of processing?
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of personal information. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process personal information, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use personal information for recordkeeping to substantiate tax liability); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for marketing or certain cookies); and (d) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally).  With respect to legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of you which require protection of personal information, such legitimate interests are the fulfilment of the processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy that are not necessary for the performance of a contract or for our compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
What are the consequences of not providing personal information?
You are not required to provide all personal information identified in this Privacy Policy to use the Site or services, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide personal information.  If you do not provide personal information, we may not be able to enter you into contests, respond to your requests, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable.
Do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?
We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
Does the Site honor do-not-track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?
Given the divergent practices of organizations that offer browsers and the lack of a standard in the marketplace, we generally do not respond to DNT signals at this time.
How long do we retain personal information?
We typically retain personal information related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law upon request.  For personal information that we collect and process for other purposes, we typically retain such personal information for no longer than the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations.
