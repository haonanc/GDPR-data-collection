COOKIES & PIXEL TAGS
Like most websites, the Museum’s uses cookies and pixel tags. These technologies do not capture or store any personal information. The Museum uses them to better understand its online visitors, to improve its marketing efforts, and to make improvements to website content, navigation, and structure.
A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a website and is stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer or device but not you personally. Cookies can store information about which webpages you’ve viewed, or what you’ve put in your online cart.
A pixel tag is a small graphical image, embedded on a webpage or in an email. When you access a page or email with a pixel tag, the tag generates a generic notice of that action. Pixel tags usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular device visits a particular page or opens an email.
If you are concerned about the use of cookies, the Museum suggests that you explore your browser's options to notify you whenever a cookie is set, or to disallow cookies altogether. Users should be aware, however, that prohibiting the use of cookies may restrict users' access to certain types of content or features.

This information is used for statistical purposes and to help the Museum monitor how visitors navigate our website. Examples of such information include IP address, browser type, and device type.
Additionally, the Museum may collect anonymized location data for WiFi-enabled devices visiting the Museum campus.
