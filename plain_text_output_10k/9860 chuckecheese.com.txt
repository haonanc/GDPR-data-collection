A SPECIAL NOTE FOR PARENTS CONCERNING PRIVACY
CEC Entertainment makes a special effort to encourage children to consult with their parents before furnishing data. However, CEC Entertainment believes that parents should supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their                                     name, address and other personal information without parental permission.
We do not seek to acquire information specifically from children under the age of 13 on the Chuck E. Cheese's website or its mobile applications.
