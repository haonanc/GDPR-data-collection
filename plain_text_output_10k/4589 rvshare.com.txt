We may disclose your personal data to enforce our policies, or where we are permitted to do so by applicable law, such as in response to a request by a law enforcement or governmental authority, or in connection with actual or proposed litigation, or to protect our property, people and other rights or interests.
We may also share your personal data with:
One of our partners if you've requested their services or if you’ve requested to be provided with information by them;
Another User if you have done business with them;
A third party performing services on our behalf;
Affiliated companies;
Other companies or business entities, for example if we are thinking of a sale, merger, or other strategic transaction with or sale to that company or business entity;
Other companies we work with to feature all or part of our Owner's RV Listings or otherwise provide promotional or other services related to our or business. This might include featuring your Listings and photographs on other websites; or

Similarly, your personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the unlikely event of a liquidation, bankruptcy, or administration.

Advertising Disclosure
We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated websites.
Newsletters
If you sign up as a Member on the website, you may receive our newsletter, which is an integral part of the Services we provide. Renters will be given the option to receive our Renter newsletter when they register with us. We may offer different newsletters from time to time intended to enhance the Services we offer. Users may cancel their subscription to these newsletters at any time, although it may take a short while for the changes in your preferences to become effective.
Surveys
We also use surveys to collect information about our users. From time to time, we request users' input in order to evaluate potential features and services. The decision to answer a survey is completely yours. We use information gathered from surveys to improve our services.
Games
From time to time we may run games on the website. These games may allow for connectivity with other users or third parties. If that is the case you consent to your personal data being transferred accordingly.
Telephone Calls
As well as collecting data online and from correspondence we may also speak with you face to face (for example at an Owner’s meeting) or by telephone. We frequently record telephone conversations. Those recordings are also governed by this Privacy Policy and we keep this data in the same way that we keep other data. Recordings of calls may also be transferred between locations or processed worldwide.
Inquiries
Renters may send inquiries to Owners via clickable links on the Listings on the website. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your email address and any other information you supply, will be visible to the Member in question so that they might reply directly to you.

Inquiries can be sent to the individual Member you selected and to our system. The resulting inquiry is available for review by the Member to whom it was initially addressed and to our customer service people, who may share past inquiry information, or information related to past stays including your contact details with Members. We may also from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of inquiry emails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by these third-party tracking systems.
How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the website reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains your responsibility:
To protect against unauthorized access to your website account;
To ensure no-one else uses the website while your machine is logged on to the website (including by logging on to your machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using);
To log off or exit from the website when not using it;
Where relevant, to keep your password or other access information secret. Your password and log-in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network; and
To maintain good internet security. For example if your email account or Facebook account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us. You should keep all of your account details secure. If you think that any of your accounts have been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. You should also tell us as soon as you can, so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.
If you have asked us to share data with third party websites, however (such as Facebook), their servers may not be secure. Credit card information is generally stored by our credit card processing partners and we ask them to keep that data secure. We also use third parties to help us optimize our website flow, content and advertising (see below).Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the internet is not secure. As a result others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data.

We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our Services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them here at our website.You may delete and block all cookies from this website, but parts of the website will not work.
Even if you are only browsing the website certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the website) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the website and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.

We gather and share information concerning the use of the website by users with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics.

Phishing or False emails
If you receive an unsolicited email that appears to be from us or one of our Members that requests personal information (such as your credit card, login, or password), or that asks you to verify or confirm your account or other personal information by clicking on a link, that email was likely to have been sent by someone trying to unlawfully obtain your information, sometimes referred to as a "phisher" or "spoofer." We do not ask for this type of information in an email. Do not provide the information or click on the link. Please contact us at support@rvshare.com if you get an email like this.
Job applicants, current and former employees
If you use the website to apply to work with us, we will use the information you supply to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics.

Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for twelve (12) months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it will then be destroyed or deleted. We retain de-personalized statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities, but individuals should not be identifiable from that data.
