Your Rights
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
As described in this notice, if you are using the Site through one of our partners (e.g. the organisation organising an action) then we are the processor of your Personal Information and our partner is the data controller. In such cases, if you want to exercise any data protection rights above or have questions or concerns about how your personal information is handled by Action Network as a processor on behalf of our partners, you should contact the relevant partner that has contracted with Action Network, and refer to their separate privacy notices.
Because Action Network has a limited ability to access Personal Information our partners submit to the Site or that you submit to the partner on the Site, if you wish to make your request directly to Action Network, please provide the name of the partner who submitted your Personal Information to the Site or who you submitted Personal Information to on the Site. We will refer your request to that partner, and will support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting the partner who you wish to delete your personal information, or by contacting us at support@actionnetwork.org with the name of the partner and we will forward your request to them, as described above.
In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.

Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.

Information Retention
We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested, to provide our partners with a service they have requested, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymise it at our partner’s request or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Legal Basis For Processing Personal Information (For Visitors From The EEA)
If you are a visitor from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
For all the data where Action Network is acting as processor, our partner makes that determination.
Where Action Network is acting as a controller, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.
If we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests, this interest will normally be to operate the Site and service, communicating with you as necessary to provide our services, improving our platform, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the "Contact Us" heading below .
