We may also share your personal information with:
Service providers under contract, who help with our business                   operations such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and                   rewards programs and co-branded credit cards.
Law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a                   verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged                   illegal activity. In such events, we will disclose information relevant                   to the investigation, such as name, city, state, zip code, telephone                   number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints,                   and transaction history.
Trusted third parties that are affiliated with Zibbet, but never without asking for your consent and                   authorization.
Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and                 our ability to keep the community free from undesirable conduct, we                 will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law                 enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without                 a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure,                 except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information                 is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to                 report suspected illegal activity.
When you post a message, your Zibbet ID or alias is visible to other                 users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to                 the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in                 return. Zibbet may be required to disclose personally identifiable                 information under special circumstances, such as to comply with                 subpoenas or when your actions violate the Zibbet Terms of Use. Zibbet                 may disclose personally identifiable information to parties in                 compliance with Zibbet’s Copyright Policy, as Zibbet in Zibbet’s sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an                 investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or                 other unlawful activity.
Zibbet will not rent, sell, or share personal information about you                 with nonaffiliated parties except as specified in this Privacy Policy                 to provide products or services you have requested or when Zibbet has                 your permission. It may be necessary to share information in order to                 investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,                 suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical                 safety of any person, violations of Zibbet’s Terms of Use, as specified                 in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by law. Zibbet will                 transfer information about you if Zibbet is acquired by or merged with                 another company. In this event, Zibbet will notify you by email or by                 putting a prominent notice on the Zibbet web site before information                 about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy                 policy.

You can                 configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or                 notify you when a cookie is set.

Third parties
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this                 document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we                 collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether                 they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites or other sites                 throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or                 disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Zibbet does not                 control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to                 the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We                 encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal                 information to others.
Security
We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and                 alteration of the information under our control. These security                 measures include a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our                 systems and maintenance of registration information in a separate                 database. Although we will exercise reasonable care in providing secure                 transmission of information between your computer and our servers, we                 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to                 us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional                 disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information                 through industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
IP recognition
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique string of numbers that                 is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web                 servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will                 use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to                 administer our Site. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad                 demographic information.
Links to other sites
Our Site contains hyperlinks and pointers to Internet sites                 maintained by third parties. These links are provided for your                 reference only. We do not control, operate or endorse in any respect                 information, products or services on such third-party sites and are not                 responsible for their content. Many third-party sites have their own                 privacy policies that differ from ours. This privacy policy only covers                 our Site and does not cover any other site. While we make every effort                 to keep your information secure, we do not control the policies of                 other sites.
Anti-spam, spoofing regulations
As part of the buying and selling process, you may obtain another                 Zibbet user's email address, shipping address and/or other information.                 Pursuant to Zibbet’s terms of use agreement, you have a limited license                 to use this information.

Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers,                 letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Zibbet                 password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal                 information with others, remember that you are responsible for all                 actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your                 password, you may lose substantial control over your personal                 information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your                 behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any                 reason, you should immediately notify Zibbet and change your password.
