Welcome to the Poetry Foundation. Please review carefully the Privacy Policy.
Last Updated: June 8, 2018
The Poetry Foundation (“TPF”, “us”, “our” or “we”) cares about your privacy and the security of your information. We want you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information, including personal information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding our use and disclosure of user information collected on the TPF website ( www.poetryfoundation.org and all sub-domains), mobile websites, applications and any other TPF products, services or tools that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Services”). The Services may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. TPF is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites.
Each time that you access or use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into by reference and subject to the Terms of Service .
As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Service Providers” means third-party companies that help us deliver or manage our Services (e.g., analytics, hosting, software maintenance, satisfaction surveys, database maintenance and magazine subscription management). For example, TPF uses third-party service providers to manage and process payments for Poetry magazine subscriptions. 
1. Information Collection
We may collect both personal information (such as, your name, address and email) and non-personal information related to you and your use of the Services in the following ways:
A. Information you provide to us directly.
Website Forms and Newsletters – You may be asked to provide personal information to us when you sign up for newsletters, fill out online forms, make a donation, or provide feedback on the Services.
Magazine Subscriptions – When you subscribe to Poetry magazine or other publications through the Services, you may be asked to create an account with us or with one of our Service Providers (e.g., Palm Coast Data). To create a seamless experience, the account setup with the Service Provider may occur through TPF’s website, where you may be asked to provide personal information and payment data, including credit card information. This information may be used and stored by the Service Provider and/or TPF to fulfill your subscription, process payments, and send you offers for other products or services that may be of interest to you.
Surveys – From time to time, we, along with our Service Providers may conduct online surveys, polls or other similar interactive activities on topics related to our programs or the Services. If you choose to participate in such a survey or a contest, you may be asked to provide personal information. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary.
Contests and Special Offers – TPF collects personal information, such as your name and email, from you when you participate in contests or special offers.

We may disclose your personal information to Service Providers who may use the information to perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting, information technology services, analytics, subscription fulfillment, and data management, and also in some cases, so they can provide, improve and communicate with you about their own products and services.

If we merge with or are acquired by another organization or entity, or assign all or part of our Services to another organization or entity, we may disclose and transfer your personal information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.
We also may share information in an aggregated manner with third parties and such third parties may further share such aggregated non-personally identifiable information further in connection with their own marketing, products, and services.

5. Blogs and Community Forums
Our Services may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums or other public areas where users may submit information and content. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

We do not have access or control of the information posted to such blogs.
