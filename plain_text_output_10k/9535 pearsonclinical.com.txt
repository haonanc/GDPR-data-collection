What is a User Level?
All materials supplied by Pearson Clinical Assessment are restricted. The level of restriction is displayed by the product User Level assigned to that product. When you register with Pearson Clinical Assessment, you will be assigned an individual User Level. Your User Level is based on your profession and qualifications and is assigned to you upon submission of your registration. This dictates which assessments you can purchase.
The following table outlines what each individual User Levels can access:
User Level

In addition to the above standard User Levels, there are also User Levels which indicate the individual has completed accredited training for a restricted product – B1, S1, T1, C1, HR1 or M1. After successful completion of training user levels will be updated as appropriate. For example: if a User Level T (Teacher) wants to administer the CELF-IV Screening test, accredited training must first be undertaken. After training is completed, the teacher’s user level will be reassigned to a T1.
