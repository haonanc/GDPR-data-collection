Below we describe how and for which purposes we may use the data provided to us by our partners and customers (including of their end users), where and how we store such data, with whom we may share it, and the choices we have available to them regarding access to, correction or deletion of their personal data that may be held with us.

AppsFlyer’s Services
AppsFlyer’s Services enable advertisers and developers (our “Customers”) to attribute and track the performance of their advertising campaigns and applications, including their effectiveness, usage, installations and downloads. Our Services also enable our Customers to analyze data regarding their campaigns, applications and their prospective and actual end-users (“End users”), including additional data received from AppsFlyer’s business partners (“Partners”), as further described below.
AppsFlyer has no direct relationship with its Customers’ End Users, or with any other individuals whose personal data we may process on our Customers’ behalf. Our Services may be used by our Customers to collect and analyze such personal data, and accordingly, we process such data under the direction of our Customers.
Customer and Partner Data
In order to receive the AppsFlyer Services, or to integrate and partner with AppsFlyer, Customers and Partners will be required to register and provide us with certain data, including personal data such as their email address, first and last name, and their company’s name and website, as well as technical data referring to their usage of our Services, their internet connection, device, systems and software used to access and use our Services.
It is each Customer’s and Partner’s voluntary decision whether to provide us with any such personal data, but refusal to provide any required data may result in us not being able to register the Customer or Partner and enable them to receive or integrate with our Services.
End Users Data received from our Customers
AppsFlyer’s Customers use our Services to track and analyze the characteristics and activities of the End Users, and for such purpose upload to AppsFlyer’s platform and servers certain data regarding their End Users. Such data is provided to AppsFlyer by the Customer, by the Customer’s integration and implementation of AppsFlyer’s SDK and APIs into the Customer’s own application or services (that are being used by the End Users). The data we receive from Customers refers to downloads, impressions, clicks and installations of their mobile applications, mobile device use and data regarding in-app events.
Our Customers may use our services to collect and analyze the data parameters, (i) unique identifiers and technical data, such as IP address, User agent, IDFA (Identifier For Advertisers) or Android ID (in Android devices); (ii) technical data regarding the End User’s operating system, device attributes and settings, applications, advertising opt-out signals, Google Advertiser ID, in-app events, device motion parameters and carrier.
Any other data should not be provided to AppsFlyer, unless specifically agreed in writing by us and in accordance with applicable law.
Once such data parameters are uploaded by our Customers to the Services, they enable us to provide the Services to our Customers and enable the Customers to analyze their campaigns and performance, as well as their End Users’ habits and characteristics.
End User Data received from our Partners
On certain instances, our Customers may choose to use our Services to integrate and connect with AppsFlyer’s third party Partners, or may, to the extent available, otherwise choose to customize or enable certain optional features on our Services, for the analysis of the data collected in connection with the Customers’ campaigns or applications (such as data segmentation, install attribution, audience-building, re-targeting, creating or supplementing End User or inventory profiles, creating, supplementing or amending interest categories, or syndication or other distribution to third parties).
In order to process such data via our Services, our Customers have to actively set parameters that allow for such customization, integration or measurement. Specifically, we permit our Customers and Partners to upload the data parameters, specified  here .
Similar to the provision of the services, AppsFlyer is acting as a third party processor on behalf of our Customers/ Partners and process such data only on their behalf.
Customers Opt Out Provision
In some cases, our customer might want to shut down all SDK tracking due to legal and privacy compliance (Such as: User didn’t provided the consent). This can be achieved with the isStopTracking API. Once this API is invoked, our SDK will no longer communicate with our servers.
End User Opt Out Self-Service Provision
If you are an End User, you can also opt-out of AppsFlyer Analytics tracking by yourself by emailing us at  privacy@appsflyer.com  or by completing the form  here . If you no longer wish to be contacted by one of our Customers that uses our Services, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly.
The opt-out is specific to AppsFlyer activities and does not affect other tools that your services provider may use. If you are an End User and choose to opt-out; we will stop tracking data for that device going forward. The services will stop across all applications.
How We Use Data
The personal data collected or processed through our Services (concerning either our Customers, their End Users, our Partners or visitors to the AppsFlyer platform or website) will be used for: (i) creating aggregate data and anonymous data (as specified below), (ii) providing the Services, and (iii) improving and maintaining our Services. For example, we use such data to help diagnose problems with our servers, to diagnose and prevent fraudulent activity, to consider and develop new services and features and to improve the Services and make them more useful.
By analyzing the data we receive, we may compile aggregate and anonymized data (“Aggregate Data”). Aggregate Data is anonymous and is not linked to any personal data. Aggregate Data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.
How We Protect Data
At AppsFlyer, we strive to implement the highest level of security processes and practices across all business units.
Our security practices are based on industry-leading standards, on which we are audited annually. Our security framework includes policies and procedures, asset management, access management, physical security, people security, product security, cloud and network infrastructure security, third-party security, vulnerability management, security monitoring, and incident response.
