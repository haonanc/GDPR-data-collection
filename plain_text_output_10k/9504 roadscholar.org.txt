Road Scholar may also collect and track digital information sent by your web browser, such as IP address, usage habits, unique device identifiers and other information. We may use and disclose such information for any number of reasons, such as working with business partners and improving our website and services. Road Scholar does not link IP addresses or cookies to any personally identifiable information.
How we use your information
Our primary goal in collecting your information is to provide you with a personalized, relevant, and positive experience with Road Scholar. Road Scholar does not sell or rent your Personal Information or purchase history to any other person or company.
We save the email addresses of those who send them to us but will only contact individuals directly with their permission, which can be changed in the My Account section of our website, or by calling or emailing us. We use the information that you voluntarily share with us to send you electronic marketing communications, catalogs, brochures or offers we believe may be of interest to you; customize our communications to you; and personalize your use of our website. We may also use the information you share with us to process your enrollment and send you enrollment confirmations; manage your account, respond to inquiries or requests by you; make travel arrangements for you; deliver program services; and collect feedback on programs you have attended.
How we protect your information
Road Scholar is committed to protecting the information we collect from you. We have put in place technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to safeguard your Personal Information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, disclosure and alteration. When you are conducting an account transaction or registering to receive electronic marketing communications, catalogs or brochures from us, we always use industry-standard encryption practices to protect your Personal Information. We limit the personally-identifying information we provide to business partners with whom we contract to only what they need to carry out their responsibilities.
Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of the information you provide to us, and any information provided to us is at your own risk. In addition, you must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
Access and disclosure of your information
Road Scholar does not share your Personal Information with any other organizations for their marketing or advertising purposes. Whenever your Personal Information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your Personal Information.
We may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers and as necessary so that they can perform requested services. Our third-party service providers are only authorized to use your Personal Information to perform services on our behalf, and they are required to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information.
We restrict access to non-public Personal Information about you to employees and third-party service providers who we reasonably believe need access to that information in order to provide necessary products or services. Those parties process information, make travel arrangements, fulfill and deliver programs, process credit card payments, and provide support services on our behalf. For example, we would share participant names and other information relevant and necessary to their enrollment with a program provider. These third parties are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purposes other than providing us with the requested products or services. 
Please note that once we share your Personal Information with another company, the information received by the other company becomes subject to the other company's privacy practices.
Certain user information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that you have uploaded to the services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the services. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use ( https://www.roadscholar.org/terms-of-use/ ) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Road Scholar, our employees, our users, or others.
