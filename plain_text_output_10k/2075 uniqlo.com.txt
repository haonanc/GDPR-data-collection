WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CUSTOMERS DOES THE SITE COLLECT?
Here are the types of information we gather:
Automatic Information
For each visitor to our Site, our server automatically recognizes information regarding the customer’s domain name (or that of the visitor’s access provider) but not the email address. In this section of the policy, what we define as “information“ means any information you can be contacted by, such as your name (first and last) and your address (city, state, zip). We may also automatically collect other non-personal information such as the type of browser you are using, the address of the website from which your visit originated, the operating system you are using, the domain name of your internet service provider, the pages you visit on the Site and the duration of your visit.
Information You Give Us
We also collect and aggregate information volunteered by customers such as when you communicate with us electronically.
Cookies
UNIQLO uses cookies and web beacons (also referred to as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) to manage and secure the Site and email programs. We do not use cookies or web beacons to collect or store personal information. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer when you visit a website. Its purpose is to manage your website experience, help prevent fraud, and allow for customization of the web pages presented to you when you return to the website. Web beacons are small bits of computer code that allow a website owner to track the actions of users on the site and recipients of email communications. Cookies and web beacons help us understand how consumers use the Site and email so we can guard against fraud and design better services in the future.

HOW DOES UNIQLO USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS ABOUT CUSTOMERS?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling or renting it to any third party. However, if we choose to do so in the future, we will notify you. We share customer information only on a limited basis and with our parent company and affiliates. We share it on a limited basis with agents we use from time to time to send postal mail and email, remove repetitive information from customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, and provide customer service. We use information about our customers for the specific purpose for which it was volunteered. In addition, if you supply us with your postal address online, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information regarding a new collection, new products, new store locations, or upcoming promotional offers or events. Sometimes we also send offers to selected groups of UNIQLO customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not wish to receive such mailings and email updates, or otherwise wish to remove your name from our list, please contact us at wecare@mail.uniqlo-usa.com . We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Site’s Terms + Conditions , and/or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. In case UNIQLO, or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of a merger, sale, consolidation or liquidation, customer information may be one of the transferred assets.
