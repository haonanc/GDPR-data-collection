What Personal Information About Customers Does Dickies.com Gather?
The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Dickies.com. Here are the types of information we gather.
Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you and communicating with you.
Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Dickies.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Dickies.com on other Web sites.
E-mail Communications: We compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please click the unsubscribe link available in your marketing emails.
What About Cookies?
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Dickies.com's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Does Dickies.com Share the Information It Receives?
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and processing credit card payments. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Dickies.com customers. If you do not want to receive such offers you can opt out of our permission based email service.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Dickies.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Protection of Dickies.com and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Dickies.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
How Secure Is Information About Me?
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
What Choices Do I Have?
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Email Updates by going to the site and selecting Email Updates from the footer navigation. (If you do not want to receive  Conditions of Use  and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Dickies.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
Are Children Allowed to Use Dickies.com?
Dickies.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Dickies.com only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.
Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions
If you choose to visit Dickies.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our  Conditions of Use , including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Texas. If you have any concern about privacy at Dickies.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the  Conditions of Use  will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
