For purposes of this policy statement, Customer Data means Personal Data and Technical Data.
 
Special categories of information or “sensitive personal data”
Certain categories of Customer Data, such as information about your race, ethnicity, religion or health, are considered special categories of information, or “sensitive personal data” under the GDPR.
Generally, we try to limit the circumstances where we collect your sensitive personal data. However, this can occasionally occur because you have made certain requests in connection with your travel arrangements that reveal or suggest something about you that could be considered “sensitive personal data”, or if you otherwise choose to provide such information to us (or a third party such as the travel agent through which you made your booking).
For example:
 
• if you request specific medical assistance from us and/or an airport operator, e.g. the provision of a wheelchair, this may reveal that you have a particular medical condition.
How we collect data from you
SIA collects Customer Data, either directly from you or from your authorised representatives (i.e. persons whom you have authorised and/or persons who have been validly identified as being your authorised representative (e.g. your organisation’s corporate travel manager) pursuant to our then-current security procedures).
SIA also collects Customer Data from third parties which are located in various countries. This includes, but is not limited to, travel agents, our KrisFlyer partners (including, amongst others, airlines and non-airlines such as Hilton, Avis, Hertz, American Express, the Economist and Esso), our service providers, other airlines including our subsidiaries to facilitate travel on code share or multi-airline flights, or through our Website, mobile services, any posts on our SIA-specific pages on social media websites and other channels including our ticketing counters and airport operations.
Where you make reservations on behalf of another person, you undertake and will ensure that the individual whose Customer Data is supplied to SIA has authorised the disclosure, is informed of and agrees to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
 
 
• Payment details, e.g. the name on the credit or debit card, the credit or debit card number, expiry date and card verification value on the credit or debit card, and billing address which will be transmitted to our payments processors.
Additional information may be mandatory if you are flying to a specific country, or if you are flying on behalf of a business registered in a specific country, e.g. your gender, nationality, passport number, the country of issue of your passport, the name, GST registration number and address of the business you are flying on behalf of, and your business email address and phone number. These mandatory fields will be clear when you make a booking.
The collection of the following types of Customer Data is mandatory to enable SIA to administer your membership with KrisFlyer: (i) title; (ii) last/family name; (iii) first/given name if you do not have a last/family name; (iv) date of birth; (v) email address; (vi) mobile phone number; (vii) mailing address; (viii) gender; (ix) nationality; and (x) whether you are an EU or Swiss resident.
