This Privacy Policy explains how OpenX Software Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“OpenX”) collect, use, and disclose information, and your choices for managing your information preferences.
What This Policy Covers
This Privacy Policy describes OpenX’s data practices associated with our corporate website (www.openx.com) and OpenX services (“Services”), and the choices that OpenX provides in connection with our collection and use of your information. This Privacy Policy is intended for both website publisher customers (“Publishers”) and individual users of websites and apps. For Publishers, this Policy explains how OpenX may collect, use and disclose information associated with your company and with your compa-ny’s websites and apps that use OpenX Services. For individual website and app users, this Privacy Policy explains how OpenX may collect, use, and disclose information when you visit our website or when you use any website or app that uses OpenX Services.
OpenX Services include our Ad Exchange, a Web-based marketplace that enables publishers, advertisers, and ad networks to efficiently market, buy and sell digital and mobile advertising and ad inventory. OpenX also offers services, such as our Ad Server, through which we act as a service provider to enable our Publishers, advertisers, ad networks, and other clients to manage their advertising inventory and to collect and use data to provide advertising on their digital and mobile properties and across the Internet. In this case, Publishers may use our services to process data, which they collect or source. Publishers and other clients may also have their own policies that govern how they collect, use, and share data. These policies may differ from OpenX’s policies described in this Privacy Policy. Please consult the privacy policies of the websites you visit and apps you use to become familiar with their privacy practices and to learn about any choices that these companies may offer with respect to their information practices.
Finally, the OpenX website may contain links to websites or content operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of a third-party website before disclosing any information to the website.
Information Collection and Use
OpenX collects contact information through our website when you choose to provide it, such as your name, username, or email address. For example, you may be asked to provide us with contact information when you register with the OpenX website and when you purchase the Services. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content, features, or services available on or through the OpenX website. In order to make payments owed to Publishers, OpenX may also request additional information from Publishers such as other contact information and billing account information.
OpenX uses this contact and billing information to operate and improve our website and Services, such as to provide notices about your Service, to fulfill your service requests, or to request your feedback or conduct research. OpenX also uses contact information to send you information about new products or Services; where OpenX needs your permission to do this, we only send such information in accordance with any permissions granted.
We may also collect additional information through our website and Services, such as the following:
 ‘Free form’ demographic information (e.g. age, gender, marital status)
 Browser information (e.g. URL, browser type, ‘click through’ data)
 Ad reporting or delivery data (e.g. size/type of ad, ad impressions, location/format of ad, data about interactions with the ad)
 Device-type information (e.g. screen dimensions, device brand and model)
 Unique identification numbers (e.g. IP address and mobile/cell phone device ID)
 Location data (as derived from IP address or GPS (for mobile))
 Interest segments (i.e. inferred information on the behavior or likely interests associated with a de-vice)
 Retargeting data (i.e. data revealing previous interest in a product or website)
 Information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices
 Information about your activities on our website and Services
With respect to data collected via the OpenX Ad Exchange, we may combine information that does not directly identify an individual with data collected from other sources and disclose the combined information to participating publishers, advertisers and ad networks so that they can determine whether to bid on ad inventory and in order to improve the relevance of the advertising presented to users. We also use the information we collect to host, operate, maintain, secure, and further develop and improve our Services, such as to keep track of advertising delivery and to measure the effectiveness of advertising delivered through our Services, and investigate compliance with OpenX’s policies and terms and conditions.
OpenX does not engage in activities that require parental notice or consent under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you believe that OpenX has inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 that is subject to parental notice and consent under COPPA, please contact OpenX using the contact information below to request deletion of the information.

Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information of European Economic Area (“EEA”)
Individuals On certain occasions, OpenX relies on the consent of the individual to process personal information (for example, when the user inputs personal information into the OpenX website). On other occasions, OpenX may process personal information when OpenX needs to do this to fulfill a contract or where OpenX is required to do so by law.
OpenX may also process data when it is in OpenX’s or its customer’s legitimate interests to do this and when these interests are not overridden by the individual’s data protection rights (which may vary based on an individual’s jurisdiction). Those legitimate interests include improving OpenX’s Services.
Interest-Based Advertising and Opting Out
OpenX adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles in the US and to the European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Principles in the European Union (“EU”) and the IAB Europe OBA Framework.
As discussed above , the OpenX Ad Exchange uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, etags, and similar technologies to give Publishers the possibility to offer, and Ad Exchange advertisers the ability to show, targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a different device. These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use data collected across non-affiliated apps over time. This is called “interest-based advertising.” In addition, certain third parties may collect data on the OpenX website and combine this data with information collected from other websites over time for purposes that include interest-based advertising.
Opting Out for Cookie-Based Services: If you would like to learn more about this type of advertising, or would prefer to opt out of website interest-based advertising enabled by OpenX’s Ad Exchange, EEA indi-viduals may opt-out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the EDAA at www.youronlinechoices.com and all other users may visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt out of this form of advertising by companies participating in the DAA self-regulatory program. Please note that in order for your opt-out choice to be effective using this tool, you must ensure that your browser is set to accept third-party cookies such as the OpenX opt-out cookie. Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, and you may need to change your browser settings to accept third-party cookies before opting out.
Opting Out for Certain Non-Cookie Services (in applicable countries): To help identify your browser and/or possible relationships between different browsers and devices, OpenX or our partners may use the local storage or cache in your browser. Using the browser cache or local storage helps OpenX or our partners deliver interest-based advertising to a browser without the use of third-party cookies. To opt out of OpenX’s use of local storage or the browser cache to provide its services, please (1) use any tools provided by your browser to clear local storage and the browser cache, and (2) turn on any “Do Not Track” header setting offered by your browser. As long as the two steps are completed and maintained on a browser, OpenX will not use local storage or the cache on that browser to identify and sync browsers and devices. If you also want to opt out of OpenX’s use of third-party cookies for interest-based advertising enabled by OpenX’s Ad Exchange, please see instructions above.
Opting Out for Mobile Application Data: To opt out of OpenX’s collection, use, and transfer of data for interest-based advertising on mobile apps, you may download the DAA’s AppChoices application from the Android or iOS app store on your mobile device. Users outside the United States may not have access to this application; instead, you can use “Limit Ad Tracking” in your iOS settings or “Opt out of interest-based ads” in your Android settings to limit OpenX’s collection of data for interest-based advertising.
Opting Out for Location Data: You may opt out of our collection, use, and transfer of precise location data by using the location services controls in your mobile device’s settings.
Effect of Opting Out: If you use a different device or browser, or erase cookies from your browser, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.
If you opt out of OpenX’s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies. Third-party advertisers and ad networks that participate in the OpenX Ad Exchange may also use their own cookies and other ad service technologies to display and track their ads. We do not control and are not responsible for such third-party advertisers’ and ad networks’ information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies. To learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.
Even if you opt-out, OpenX may continue to collect data for other purposes and you still will receive adver-tising from the OpenX Ad Exchange when you visit websites of a Publisher who uses our Services – but such advertising will not be targeted to you.
