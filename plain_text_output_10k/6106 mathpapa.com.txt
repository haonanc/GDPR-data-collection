In each case, MathPapa collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with MathPapa.

Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
