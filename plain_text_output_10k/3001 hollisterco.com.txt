Our Websites provide features, such as a store locator service and the ability to check-in at our stores, if you have enabled the location-based services on your mobile devices.  The features on our Websites that require determining your location may make use of the GPS information on your mobile device.  Sometimes we use other information, such as your IP address or nearby wireless access points or cell phone tower locations, to roughly estimate where you are to provide you the feature on our Websites that requires understanding where you are located.  If you use one of the features on our Websites that require locating you, we will collect and process your location data for this purpose.

We make the names and postal addresses in our postal mailing list, sometimes categorized by purchasing information, available to our affiliates (i.e., Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie kids, and Gilly Hicks) and other unaffiliated companies for their marketing purposes. See the “Opt-Out” section below for instructions on how to opt out of sharing with unaffiliated companies. 
Please be aware that we may use third parties to assist us with our Websites, our e-commerce business and our Social Media Pages. Some examples of the assistance that may be provided by third party service providers are: fulfilling orders (including, but not limited to, processing payments, providing fraud prevention services, and verifying addresses); providing advertising services, including on social media sites and internet search engines; monitoring and analyzing site activity, your actions in response to emails and the effectiveness of our advertising; conducting surveys; administering and maintaining employment application information; administering and sending text messages and Notifications via a mobile device; offering interactive features on our App; and administering emails, our Hollister Club Cali program, promotions, sweepstakes or contests.

Cookies and Advertising
What Are Cookies, Pixel Tags and URL Links, and How Are These Used on Our Websites or in Our Emails?
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may use, a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive or mobile device. The information collected when visiting our Websites may include the following: an IP address; the URL of the page from which you arrived; your browser type; other technical information about your device used to visit our Websites; the pages you view; the features you use; whether you create an account or become a member in the Club Cali program (collectively “Membership”), or sign in and where you go on our Websites once signed into your Membership; whether you complete a transaction; whether you have previously completed a survey; and the time of your visit. This information allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Websites are most visited or used, what products are browsed and/or purchased, the effectiveness of the Websites, your specific interaction with our Websites and difficulties you may experience in accessing our Websites. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on our Websites by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, personalize your experience, and resolve access difficulties. In addition, our Websites use cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart, whether you purchase any or all of those items, and to tell us whether you have visited one of our Websites in the past. This allows you to maintain shopping carts between visits, and allows us to inquire about your continued interest in items in your shopping cart or that you viewed on one of our Websites. Our Websites also use cookies to help keep track of checkout information, other than payment method information, while you remain on our site. In addition, the information collected by us or our service provider(s) may be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
Our Websites use, and our third party service providers may also use, Pixel Tags (also known as Web beacons, Web bugs, and Clear GIFs) on the Websites and in emails. A Pixel Tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a Webpage or email message. Pixel Tags may be used to collect the same information about your visit that is collected through cookies, as noted above. We may also collect information about a search engine used, and a search engine advertisement clicked to navigate to the Websites. Pixel Tags in emails also help us confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails (including your interaction with your Websites as a result of receiving the email) and the time our email is viewed. This information helps us to make similar evaluations about our Websites and emails as with cookies and to determine the most desired features and information so that we can provide those features and information to you and personalize our interactions with you. This information may also be linked to and combined with information that we collect about you from your visits to our Websites.
In addition, our email communications to you may include a "click-through URL" linked to a particular page on one of our Websites. By clicking on one of the URLs, you will automatically enter one of our Websites and we may collect information related to the "click-through". You may avoid having this information collected by not clicking on the URL links in our email communications.
How Do Third Parties Serve You Our Advertisements?
We contract with third party advertising companies to serve you advertisements.  Non-personally identifiable information may be shared with third parties for marketing purposes.  Some third parties may collect non-personally identifying information about you by placing cookies on your browser and/or using Pixel Tags when you visit our Websites. These advertising companies may use and share the information gathered about your visit to our Websites to deliver our ads on other websites that are a part of their online advertising networks and/or search engines.  We receive aggregate information from these third parties to gauge our advertising effectiveness. To stop receiving ads from a third party advertising company we use, click on the link included in the advertisement and follow the instructions on opting out.  We may use more than one third party company for advertising, which would require you to opt-out of each company through each of the advertisement links separately.  If you would like more information about how third party advertising works in general and more information on how to opt-out, go to: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (you will leave this site for a centrally managed online site where you can specify your preference).

We may share this information and media with the modeling agency that we engage to assist us in determining whether we are interested in you becoming a model.
If you electronically send us information about your interest in being a model for us (such as your name, size stats, work information, contact information, photographs, and video), we will only use that information to determine whether we are interested in you being a model and to contact you about prospective modeling. We may share also that information with our modeling agency. The modeling agency will use your information solely to assist us in determining whether we are interested in you being an Abercrombie & Fitch model.
