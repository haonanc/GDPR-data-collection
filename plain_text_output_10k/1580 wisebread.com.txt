What Information Do We Collect?
When you visit KA Websites you may provide us with two types of information:   personal information you actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”) and usage information collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and others browse KA Websites (“Passive Information”).
Active Information You Choose to Provide
We may receive and store any information you choose to enter on KA Websites or provide to us in any other way (such as email, regular mail, IM, or telephone contact).  KA Websites generally collect personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent.  For example, when you register for a user account, subscribe to our publication, make a purchase, create a user profile, enter a contest, complete a survey, sign up for a  newsletter, use our forums, leave a comment, or register for any of our services, you will be asked to provide information such as your name, email address, address, or phone number.  Other optional demographic information such as your age, gender, or educational level may also be requested.
If you provide personally identifiable information, it will be used to provide you with the service you have requested.  For example:
Register      for an account:  We require a user      name and a working email address.
Participate      in a contest:  We require your real      name, verification of information to satisfy legal requirements and the      conditions of the contest, and       information required to notify you and ship prizes to you if you      win (such  information may include      name, email, telephone number, and a shipping address).
Participating      in a survey:  We may ask you to      provide relevant data regarding your preferences and demographics information      to answer survey questions.
Creating a      user profile:  You can put as much      or as little biographical information in your profile.  You can add information such as a bio,      personal preferences, contact information, photograph, etc.
Passive Information Collected
KA Websites utilize standard technologies called “cookies” and "log files" to collect information about how KA Websites are used.  Passive Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at KA Websites, the websites visited just before and just after KA Websites, what type of web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Firefox, etc.) you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.  Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to your personal information so that you remain anonymous. If you do not wish to transmit “cookie” information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser; please consult the “Help” section of your browser to correctly do so.
What is a Cookie?
Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a website.  They are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s web browser on one website to simplify subsequent interactions with that website by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transaction on related web pages.  This makes it easier for a user to move from website to website and to complete transactions over the Internet.  Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
How Do We Use the Information Collected?
Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction use Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer services such as support, and making available other products or services we think may be of interest to our users.  If you provided personally identifiable information in order to receive a specific service or product, it will be used to provide you with the service or product you have requested.
We may use the Active Information or Passive Information you provide to us to contact you about changes to our Website, new services, forgotten passwords, contest winnings, changes to our agreements and policies, features or products we offer, or other information we think you shall find valuable.  If at any time you do not wish to receive such information, please send us an email at:
We use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance and design our Website to make it easier, faster, and friendlier to use.

However, Passive Information may result in your viewing of particular advertising based on your user habits for your viewing on KA Websites.
