This Tuft & Needle Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the Internet Site and any other digital properties (collectively, the “Site”) operated by Fosbrooke, Inc. dba Tuft & Needle (“T&N”, "our", “we”, or “us”). The Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into the Tuft & Needle Terms & Conditions of Service (the “Terms”).
I. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site. You may wish to review the Privacy Policy regularly to see whether it has changed, as your continued use of the Site following a posted update will signify your acceptance of the Privacy Policy, as posted.
II. Purpose of this Privacy Policy
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about how T&N may collect, use, and disclose personal information from you and other users of the Site.
III. Definitions
The following definitions apply when these terms are used in the Privacy Policy. If a term is not defined in Privacy Policy, it may be defined in the Terms.
“IP Address” refers to “Internet Protocol Address” and means the unique number that allows computers attached to the Internet to know where to send you data (such as the webpages you view) and where the data that you are sending is coming from.
“Personal Information” means information that, alone or when in combination with other information, may be used to identify, contact, or locate you personally. Your Personal Information includes your name, address, email address, and phone number. Your Personal Information does not include information that we obtain in or transform into an anonymous format from which a third party cannot easily identify you. However, if we collect your IP address (which is typically Non-personal Information) and link it to your full name or other type of Personal Information, the combination of this data would be "Personal Information."
“Non-Personal Information” means information that does not identify you as a specific individual, including without limitation IP type, ISP address, cookie IDs (and segment IDs associated with cookie IDs), pages viewed, and/or search terms entered, browser type, operating system, duration and frequency of visits, anonymous usage statistics including frequency of messaging and interaction with other users, clickstream data other log file data, or social analytics and tracking measurements. With respect to mobile devices, “Non-Personal Information” also may include device type, make and model, operating system, carrier, user ID, similar device IDs, and information about various apps that you use. We may link your Non-Personal Information link to your Personal Information which, in combination, may become Personal Information.
“Aggregate Data” means Non-Personal Information that we collect about a group or category of customers or Products. Aggregate data helps us to understand trends so that we can better consider new Products and services, analyze usage, facilitate payments, or otherwise improve or tailor our offerings. For example, we may collect data about the shopping habits of residents of a particular state (without linking this data to any specific personal information about those residents).
To "use" or to "process" information means to handle or utilize the information in any way, including without limitation by subjecting the information to statistical or other evaluation or analysis, or by collecting, storing, modifying, deleting, combining the information (including by using cookies on a computer), or by disclosing and/or transferring the information within our company or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
IV. Types of Information We Collect About You
We collect Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, and Aggregate Data as defined above. The categories of information we collect from you include:
Name and Contact Information: We may collect your name, email address, phone number, and other similar contact information.
Demographic Information: We may collect demographic information such as age, gender, city, state, and country.
Usage Information: We may collect data about how you and your devices interact with the Sites and our related services. This could include features you use, the web pages you visit, the products you view, and the search terms you enter. This could also include data about your devices and the network you use to connect to our services, including IP Address, device identifiers, and data about the performance of the services you use on the Sites and any problems you experience with them.
Content and Other Information You Provide to Us: We collect additional content and information that you voluntarily provide us, such as transaction information (e.g. purchase date, purchase amount) when you purchase something from us or inquire about one of our products, or content you submit when you contact us via the Sites or by e-mail.
Location Information. We may also collect your location if you choose to allow us to track your location through our Sites or through other means, or if your Personal or Non-Personal Information indicates a certain geographic location. This information may help us provide recommendations to you based on your location, serve you with advertisements, or direct you to offerings that may be of interest to you and/or are marketed to persons near your location.
V. How We Collect Your Information
1. Personal Information
We do not collect Personal Information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we will ask you to provide us with certain Personal Information when you purchase a Product from the Site or when you communicate with us about a Product that you have purchased from us. When you make a payment for a Product that you purchase via the Site, you will likely need to provide Personal Information to our third party service providers (i.e., payment processors), such as your credit card number. We may also collect Personal Information from you if you send us Personal Information in an email, via the chat functionality on the Sites, or when you type information into certain fields (e.g., an email address field) on the Sites.
We also collect any information that you may choose to post on or via the Site, such as Postings or Feedback . If you choose to submit any such information, it will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein because it will be considered public information. We are not responsible for use by others of information that you post publicly.
We may ask you to participate in surveys or polls from time to time. If you decide to participate voluntarily, we may ask you to provide certain information, which may include Personal Information. We may use such information in any manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
We may also collect your location if you choose to allow us to track your location through our Site or through other means, or if your Personal or Non-Personal Information indicates a certain geographic location. This information may help us provide recommendations to you based on your location, serve you with advertisements, or direct you to offerings that may be of interest to you and/or are marketed to persons near your location.
2. Non-Personal Information
We use your IP Address to deliver our Site to you upon request, to tailor the Site and our Products and advertising to the interests of our customers, and to measure traffic within the Site.
Like many other organizations, we also collect Non-Personal Information via our Site through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels or pixel tags, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Site. The use of these technologies enables us to improve our Site and the services that we offer by providing insight into, among other things, which Products and features are most popular, the number of computers accessing our Site at particular times, ways in which we might personalize and improve your experience with our Site, and the preferences of you and other visitors to our Site.
Here are general definitions and descriptions of the types of technologies that we may use to collect Non-Personal Information via our Site.
Cookies. A cookie is a small text or data file that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and is stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting but allow you to block, delete, or pre-approve cookies. However, if you do that, certain websites, including our Site may not work fully or properly (e.g., you may not be able to access or use certain pages, features, or functionality). Some of the cookies that we use may be flash cookies/Adobe cookies, which are more persistent in nature. These cookies may not be deleted when your cookies are deleted. If you are interested in learning more about this, you should check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted. If you wish to block, delete, or pre-approve the use of cookies, you generally must do so on each computer and browser on which you wish to block, prevent, or pre-approve such cookies.
Web Beacons. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be in the form of a "png" image, as well as iframe, script, input link, embed, object, and other tags that are used to track usage. We may use these web beacons on our Site to deliver cookies, to attribute sales to any advertising media or affiliate partners with whom we may have a relationship, to count visits, to compile statistics about usage, to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns, and/or in emails that we may send you in order to tell if you have opened or acted on email that we have sent you.
Pixels. A pixel is a piece of code or an electronic image embedded on the Site (but ordinarily not visible to users) that collects information about users’ engagement on that web page. The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page within the Site or clicked on a particular advertisement, to deliver branded services, and/or to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
Server Log Data. When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This data may include information such as your IP Address, browser type, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, the pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information for which you may search on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and for general technical administration of the Site, to improve the Site’s functionality and convenience, and to better serve our customers’ needs and preferences. We also may use Server Log Data to verify that Site visitors meet criteria that we have established as necessary before processing their purchases.
3. Third Parties
Please note that we may use third party service providers or vendors to help us operate and improve the Site and/or transact business (including, without limitation, maintenance services, database management providers, payment processors, or web analytics consultants, etc.). These third party service providers may also collect or have access to Non-Personal Information from our Site. Such third party service providers and vendors are not authorized to use the Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Please let us know via [email protected] if you want a list of such third parties.
In addition, the feature of our purchase process that auto-populates addresses when you begin typing them into our order form implements functionalities that are enabled by Google Maps APIs. By using those features of functionalities, you are bound by Google’s Privacy Policy with respect to those features or functionalities. Google’s Privacy Policy can be found here .
4. Fraud
T&N is aware of and concerned about identity theft and unlawful practices known as "phishing.” We do not and will not solicit or request your credit card information or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. If you receive such solicitations or requests that appear to be from T&N, please contact us at [email protected] before responding. More information is available on the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
5. Opting Out
As noted above, you may block, delete, or pre-approve use of cookies on your computer by adjusting your web browser settings. Such limitations are not effective on mobile applications, but many applications allow users to “opt out” of certain advertisements and other features by adjusting their mobile device settings. There also exist websites on which you may “opt out” of receiving targeted advertisements from third parties who may obtain your Non-Personal Information but who also participate and comply with advertising industry self-regulatory programs. Here are examples:
We may use advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies to serve advertisements on the Sites. Please be advised that such parties may gather information about your visit to the Sites or other sites (such as through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies) to enable such advertising companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were delivered. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices please visit optout.networkadvertising.org/  and  www.aboutads.info/choices/ . PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING COMPANIES.
To facilitate the delivery of relevant content, some cookies we use are for ‘Google Analytics’. Those are used to identify how users engage with our Site and to provide us with interest and demographic information regarding Site visitors. We may also use this information to optimize marketing and refine advertising and/or programming strategies. For a complete privacy policy and instructions to ““opt out” of Google Analytics’ data aggregation and usage, please see here .
Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” (a/k/a/ DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
If you receive a marketing email from us that you would prefer not to have received, you can use the “unsubscribe” link found at the bottom of the email to “opt out” of receiving future emails, or you can contact us at [email protected] to request the same. We will comply with your request, but we are not responsible for removing your Personal Information from the possession of any third party who previously obtained the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you consent to our providing your e-mail address to a third party to receive their separate marketing communications, you will be responsible for opting out of such communications as well.
VI. How We Use Your Information
