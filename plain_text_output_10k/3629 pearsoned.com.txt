Pearson receives authorization and consent to collect, process and otherwise handle Personal Information of a Secondary Student User or a Youth User under this Privacy Policy and the EULA when a parent, Institution or Educator of such User (a) purchases                     the Services for such User; (b) establishes an User Account for such User; (c) registers such User to use the Services; (d) instructs such User to establish an account or register to use the Services; or (e) directs such User to complete                     schoolwork or assignments using the Services.

Global Nature of the Services
For some of Pearson’s Services, Personal Information may be transmitted, stored and processed in a country other than the one in which the User resides or the Educator or Institution is located. The authorization and consent for Pearson to collect, process and otherwise handle Personal Information under this Privacy Policy includes consent and authorization for the User’s Personal Information to be transferred and stored in countries outside of their residence, which may include the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as any country where the Educator or Institution may be located or the User may visit.
Protection and Security
To protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure, Pearson maintains a comprehensive information security program and employs reasonable and appropriate physical, administrative and technical safeguards. Pearson                 performs periodic risk assessments of its information security program and prioritizes remediation of identified security vulnerabilities.
Collection and Processing
Pearson collects and processes data in order to provide the Services for educational purposes. This data may include Personal Information.
Payment Data
If a Customer purchases the Services online directly from Pearson, payment data submitted by that Customer will be used and disclosed to the Customer’s financial institution and Pearson’s payment processing vendor for the purpose of processing                     payment for the Services ordered.
Account Data
Pearson collects and processes Account Data to set up, maintain and enable a User account to use the Services. Account Data includes a User’s name (unless an alias is used with Educator or Institution approval/coordination), email address,                     user name and password, as well as the Institution and course identifier for any courses for which User uses the Services. With coordination/approval by the Educator, a User may be registered for a User account using an alias* instead                     of actual first and last name. Account Data does not include student coursework or responses, scores, grades or instructor feedback on interactive exercises, assignments or assessments.
*Alias Registration Option
With Educator approval/coordination, a User account may be established by using an alias name (pseudonym) and email address that is not otherwise associated with Personal Information provided to Pearson. Alias Registration may not                         be available if the User account is established through integration with a third party service or if the Institution or Educator establishes the User Account or otherwise prohibits the use of this option. If a User establishes                         a User account through Alias Registration, the User must notify each Educator of the alias information used to establish the User account so that the Educator can recognize the User account as belonging to that User.
Course Data
Course Data means educational data collected, generated or processed through use of the Services in connection with educational coursework. Course Data includes assignments, student coursework, responses to interactive exercises, assignments                     and assignments, scores, grades and instructor comments. Pearson collects and processes Course Data in order to provide the Services to Users, Educators and Institutions for educational purposes.
Community/Forum Postings; Other Communications
Information posted by a User in a community or forum or communicated with a communication tool provided through the Services may constitute Personal Information. Postings and communications will be visible to and shared with all members                     of the community or forum. Pearson is not responsible for further use or disclosures by others who are members of the community or forum or recipients of any communications.
Google Drive
Some Services may have the capability to connect to your Google Drive so that you can upload or download documents directly from or into your Google Drive.  Before they do so, you will receive a prompt asking you to click "Allow" to enable the Services to connect to your Google Drive.   You may remove this connection in the My Account settings for your Google account at any time.  Pearson will use this connection to access your Google Drive only for the purpose of uploading or downloading documents that you specifically select with limited metadata to allow identification and retrieval, so that you can access and use the documents within the Services or download them to Google Drive.  Pearson will use, process and store these documents and associated personal data in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
Cookies and Related Technologies
The Services use cookies to enable Users to sign-in to the Services and access stored preferences and settings. Users, Educators and Institutions have a variety of tools to control the use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies,                     including browser controls to block and delete cookies. Disabling or blocking these technologies, however, may prevent or impair required functionality and use of the Services.
Application and System Logs
Application and system logs are critical to ensuring the delivery, availability and security of the Services.  Pearson automatically collects log data related to User interaction with the Services.  This data may include browser type, type of computer/device                     and technical information about the User’s means of connection to the Services, such as operating system, internet service provider and IP address.  This data is collected and used for support purposes and to monitor the health of the Services, identify problems, improve service, detect unauthorized access                     and fraudulent activity, prevent and respond to security incidents and appropriately scale the computing resources for the Services.
Feedback, De-Identified and Aggregate Data
Pearson may provide Users with the opportunity to evaluate and provide feedback on the Services on a voluntary basis.  Pearson may use and disclose such data in de-identified form, as well as other  de-identified data and de-identified aggregate                     data collected and processed through the Services, to deliver, maintain, support, evaluate and improve the Services, conduct educational research, develop new products and services and for other purposes.  De-identified data is not considered                     Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
Web Analytics
Pearson may use third party web trend analytical services, including Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics, to collect visitor information, such as IP addresses, browser types, referring pages, pages visited and time                     spent on a particular site. While these analytical services collect and report information on an anonymous basis, they may use cookies to gather web trend information. The information gathered may enable Pearson (but not the third party web trend services) to link information with application and system log data. Pearson uses this information for                     system administration and to identify problems, improve service, detect unauthorized access and fraudulent activity, prevent and respond to security incidents, appropriately scale computing resources and otherwise support and deliver the Services.

Do Not Track
Do Not Track (DNT) is a proposed mechanism for allowing website visitors to control the collection of certain usage data. Although there has been research into the development of a standard to support the use of DNT signals, there is no                     adopted standard to follow. The Services do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.
