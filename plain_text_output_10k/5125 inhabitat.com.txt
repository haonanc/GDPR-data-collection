Your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018
Under the General Data Protection Regulation 2018, you have various         rights in relation to your information. Detailed below are your rights         and a description of each one.
You have the right to:
Be informed – this means you have the right to be informed about the collection and             use of your personally identifiable data – this is detailed above in             more detail.
Have access to your information – you have the right to access your personally identifiable data and             supplementary information. This will be provided free of charge.             However, when a request is manifestly unfounded, excessive or             repetitive we reserve the right to charge a fee. We may also charge             a reasonable fee to comply with requests for further copies of the             same information. You can request access to your information by             emailing us at subjectaccessrequest@habito.com .
Have personally identifiable information rectified – you have a right to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or             completed if it is incomplete. We will inform you when any inaccurate             information is corrected.
Erase your personally identifiable information – the right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’.             You can make a request for erasure of information verbally or in             writing. We will respond to your request within one month. The right             is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances. For             example it does not apply when we have statutory or regulatory             obligations to keep your data.
Restrict processing of personally identifiable data – you have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your            personal data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in            certain circumstances. When processing is restricted, we are permitted            to store the data, but not use it.
Port your personally identifiable data – this right allows you to obtain and reuse your personally identifiable             data for your own purposes across different services. It allows you             to move, copy or transfer personally identifiable data easily from             one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without             hindrance to usability.
Object to the processing of your data – you have a right to object to the processing of your data for purposes             of scientific or historical research and statistics, as well as for             the purposes of direct marketing (including profiling).
Challenge any decision made by automated decision making – we will inform you when we are performing automated decisioning and           when we do we will give you information about the processing activity.           We will introduce simple ways for you to request human intervention or           challenge a decision made by automated decision making.

Credit decisions, the prevention of fraud and money laundering
Your lender may use credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to         help them make decisions. A short guide to what the lender does and how         the lender, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will use your         information is detailed below. If you would like to read the full details         of how your data may be used, please contact your lender.
A condensed guide to the use of your personally identifiable           information by the lender and at credit reference and fraud prevention           agencies
If you apply for a mortgage through Habito, we will provide the         information we hold about you to your lender. The lender will use this         information to help make its decision about whether or not to lend to         you. This will involve checking the following records about you and         others:
Its own records;
Those at fraud prevention agencies (FPAs).
When CRAs receive a search request from the lender they will place a         search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other lenders.         They supply to lenders both public (including the electoral register)         and shared credit and fraud prevention information. Having multiple         search footprints on your credit file may affect your ability to borrow         in the future.
The lender will make checks such as assessing your application for         credit and verifying the applicants’ identities to prevent and detect         crime and money laundering. The lender may also make periodic searches         at CRAs and FPAs to manage your account with them.
If you are making a joint application or tell us or the lender that you         have a spouse or financial associate, the lender will link your records         together, so you must be sure that you have your partner’s agreement to         disclose their information. CRAs also link your records together and         these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you         or your partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to         break that link.
Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded by        them. Where you borrow from the lender, the lender will give details of        your accounts and how you manage it/them to CRAs. If you borrow and do        not repay in full and on time, CRAs will record the outstanding debt.        This information may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs        to perform similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts        that you owe.
Records remain on file for 6 years after they are closed, whether         settled by you or defaulted.
If you give false or inaccurate information and the lender suspects or         identifies fraud, the lender will record this and may also pass this         information to FPAs and other organisations involved in crime and fraud         prevention.
If you have borrowed from the lender and do not make payments that you         owe them, the lender will trace your whereabouts and recover debts.
The lender and other organisations may access and use the information         recorded by fraud prevention agencies based in other countries.
Automated credit decisions
Your mortgage application may be assessed by the lender by the means of         automated decision making and if it is declined we will endeavour to         request from the lender the actual reason why the application has been         declined. Once we know this reason we will contact you as soon as we         are able to convey this to you.
