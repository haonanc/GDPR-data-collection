Brayola’s Commitment to Privacy
Brayola respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains Brayola’s policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you.
What is Personal Information?
“Personal Information” is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a person’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases (through affiliate programs or directly from us). Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us. We also collect Personal Information which you provide us, including your photos, size and garment choices. When you register we collect your e-mail address. If you login by means of social media, we will receive such Personal Information about you as is provided by your social media account. Please check the relevant social media account policies in order to understand what information we receive. You are not required by law to provide us with any such information, but by using the Site and Services and agreeing to the Terms of Service you agree to provide us with such information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires. We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about the use of the Site and/or Services. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use located at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html and the Google Privacy Policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ .

Other Disclosures
In providing the Site and Services, we may use subcontractors that are located in countries other than your own, and send them information we receive. For example, we may send your information to the United States. All our subcontractors will be subject to non-disclosure and non-use obligations. Nevertheless, some countries may have levels of protection of personal and other information which are not as high as in your country of residence or business.
In addition, we may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Brayola, our customers, or the public.

Protection of Personal Information
Brayola has put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access. Further, when you enter personal information online, that information is encrypted using a security software called SHA1. SHA1 encrypts all information before it is sent over the Internet, including passwords to Brayola accounts. Account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. If other people have access to your email, they may be able to obtain access to your password and obtain personal information about you, or change information about your user profile. You may not want to use an email account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such email accounts.
