Welcome to the Massachusetts State Lottery web site. Your privacy, and the                             security of your personal information, is important to us. When you visit                             this web site, we may collect the following information about your visit:

Personal information that you knowingly give to us.
This privacy policy applies only to the use of the Massachusetts State                             Lottery web site. Other web sites operated by state agencies have individual                             privacy polcies tailored to the interactions available through each site. On                             the Lottery’s web site, you may also see links to external web sites. We                             strongly suggest that you read the privacy policies for each web site that                             you visit.
A Privacy Partnership
Your privacy with respect to the use of this web site results from a                             partnership between the Commonwealth and you, the user. At this web site, we                             attempt to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However,                             because some of the information that we receive through this web site is                             subject to the Public                             Records Law, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66, Section 10 , we                             cannot ensure absolute privacy. Information that you provide to us through                             this site may be made available to members of the public under that law.                             This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at this                             site, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can                             access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed choice about                             your use of this site and whether to share personally identifiable                             information with us through this site.
Personally Identifiable Information
We use the term “personally identifiable information” to mean                             any information that could reasonably be used to identify you, including,                             but not limited to, your name, address, e-mail address, Social Security                             number, birth date, bank account information, credit card information, or                             any combination of other identifying information.

Information Automatically Collected and Stored by this Site
The Lottery may place a “ cookie ”, a small                             text file, on a visitorâ€™s hard drive. This cookie contains a randomly                             generated user ID in order to track unique site visits. The Lottery does not                             uses cookies to store any personal information. This cookie can only be read                             by Lottery servers and assists us with the statistical analysis necessary to                             assure site functionality and responsiveness.
This site does collect and store indefinitely your Internet                             Protocol (“IP”) address (which does not identify you as an                             individual), as well as information about the date and time of your visit,                             whether a file you have requested exists, and how many “bytes” of                             information were transmitted to you over the Web from this site. We use your                             IP address to assess the frequency of visits to this site and the popularity                             of its various pages and functions. We will not attempt to match any                             personally identifiable information that you provide to us with your IP                             address, unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that doing so would                             provide information that is relevant and material to a criminal                             investigation.
Dissemination of Your Personally Identifiable Information
We do not sell any personally identifiable information collected through                             this web site or submitted to the Lottery in conjunction with using                             functions on the web site, and there is no direct or online public access to                             the information. However, once you voluntarily submit personally                             identifiable information to us, its dissemination is governed by the Public Records Law ,                             the Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66A (Fair Information Practices Act), Executive Order 412 , and other applicable laws and regulations. In addition,                             dissemination of information collected through this web site may be made in                             the course of a law enforcement investigation, or through compulsory legal                             process. For these reasons, part or all of the information you send us may                             be disseminated.
In addition, the information that you voluntarily submit will be disclosed                             only to Commonwealth employees or officials, or those under contract with                             the Commonwealth, with a “need to know” for purposes of                             fulfilling their job responsibilities. They will only use the information to                             answer your questions, respond to any requests for assistance, and fulfill                             the Commonwealth’s legal obligations. Where appropriate, we may                             provide the information submitted by you to the person or company that is                             the subject of your inquiry, or to a government agency responsible for the                             matters referred to in your communication.
Your Access and Opportunity to Correct
The Public Records Law and the Fair Information Practices Act provide you                             certain rights to get information about you that is in our records. To learn                             more about the circumstances under which you can get and correct this                             information, please click on the above references to these laws.
Security
Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send                             information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use                             standard security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable                             information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We                             also use software programs to monitor network traffic to identify                             unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause                             damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts                             are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.
Special Protections Against Misuse Of Personally Identifiable Information Within Commonwealth Offices
In 1999 Executive Order 412 was issued, which enhanced the privacy                             protection given to any information about you as a named individual held by                             the Executive Department of state government. Executive Order 412 limits the                             collection and dissemination of personally identifiable information within                             the Executive Department. This site complies with Executive Order 412 , so                             all of the personally identifiable information that you submit to this site                             is given the privacy protections set forth in Executive Order 412 .
Policy Changes
We will post substantive changes to this policy at least 7 days before they                             take effect. Any information we collect under the current privacy policy                             will remain subject to the terms of this policy. After any changes take                             effect, all new information we collect, if any, will be subject to the new                             policy.

Definitions
Cookies are files that a Web site can place on your                             computer. A cookie file contains unique information that a Web site can use                             to track such things as your password, lists of Web pages you have visited,                             and the date when you last looked at a specific Web page, or to identify                             your session at a particular Web site. A cookie file allows the Web site to                             recognize you as you click through pages on the site and when you later                             revisit the site. A Web site can use cookies to “remember” your                             preferences, and to record your browsing behavior on the Web. Although you                             can prevent Web sites from placing cookies on your computer by using your                             browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability to view                             or interact with some Web                             sites.
An “Internet Protocol Address” or “IP Address” is a series of numbers that identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. An IP                             address enables a server on a computer network to send you the file that you                             have requested on the Internet. The IP address disclosed to us may identify                             the computer from which you are accessing the Internet, or a server owned by                             your Internet Service Provider. Because it is machine-specific, rather than                             person-specific, an IP address is not, in and of itself, personally                             identifiable information.
