However, under the law, we are not required to provide this information as long as we: (1) notify you of that you have the right to prevent disclosure of personal information, and (2) provide you with a cost-free means to exercise that right. As noted in this Privacy Statement, we require California residents to opt-in to activities where we would share their personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and you would like to prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to participate in these activities. If you are a California resident, and you have opted in to one of these activities, but you later decide that you would like to prevent our disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, please contact us by sending a message to privacy@coxinc.com .
As of the Effective Date listed above, there is no commonly accepted response for Do Not Track signals initiated by browsers.

TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Overview. The information we gather generally falls into one of two categories: (1) information that you voluntarily supply when you are on the site, which may include, but not be limited to your name, email and mailing address) or when you participate in the features we offer on the site (such as comments posted on a blog, discussion group, or other social networking features on the site), and (2) information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors navigate on the site. In some cases, one of our agents or Affiliates may collect the information on our behalf. Third party Service Providers (as defined below) that provide all or some of the services available through this site also may be gathering the same kinds of information.
Registration Information.  To make use of certain features available on the site (such as to receive email newsletters, to post a classified ad, or to participate in some social networking features) you may need to register and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. If permitted by the site, you may be able to bypass some of the steps within the registration process by using your user name and password associated with your account on certain specified social networking sites when you register for our site, but you will still have to complete the registration process after entering that information. We or our Service Providers may also ask for information from you if you buy products or services or conduct other transactions via this site. We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age or zip code, and we might request information on your interest in sports, your favorite college or professional sports teams, personal finance, the performing arts, and the like. The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, to tailor the site to your interests and make them more useful to you, and also may be used in the processing of e-commerce transactions. In addition, our Service Providers may provide us with additional personal information about you that you provide to them through your separate accounts with them as described in their own privacy statements.
The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don’t supply the information we request, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to the site. For instance, we can’t send you email alerting you to a new service we’re offering, or content that may interest you (for example, breaking news or sports headlines) if you don’t tell us what you’re interested in and give us your email address.
Contests and Other Promotions. From time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions via the site. If you enter one of these contests, sweepstakes or promotions, you’ll have to provide information about yourself (such as your name, address, telephone number and email address) so that we can administer and operate the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion (including contacting you if you win, fulfilling a prize, and publishing a winners’ list). If you don’t want us to collect the information requested in the registration form or to provide it to any of our Affiliates, Service Providers and co-sponsor(s) as described below, please do not enter the contest, sweepstakes or promotion.
Payment Information. We may offer you premium content or merchandise via the site. When you elect to purchase such content or merchandise through the site, we or our Service Providers may ask for additional information from you, such as payment card information.
Email Newsletters. We may also offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters that we make available through this site. If you have opted in to receive a particular newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if you decide not to receive further mailings of the newsletter from us. See “Opting In/Opting Out” below.
Cookies. To help make our sites more responsive to the needs and interests of our visitors, we keep track of the pages visited by our users by placing a cookie, a small entry in a text file, on your hard drive. Our advertisers and Service Providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, which is a process that we don’t control.
We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs and enhance your experience with the site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize the ads you see on our site or to avoid showing you the same ad repeatedly during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our site, the CMG Network of Sites, or other sites visited by our users. We may also use cookies to measure site performance and/or advertising performance. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. You can manage your browser’s cookie setting through the “options” menu on most commercially available web browsers, including options to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely. Of course, if you set your browser not to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our site.
Web Beacons. Our site may contain electronic images (called “single-pixel GIFs” or “web beacons”) or other tools that allow us and our Affiliates, Service Providers, vendors and, where necessary, our advertisers to count users who have visited particular pages of this site, the CMG Network of Sites, or other sites or applications, or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other technologies to recognize which links the visitors click and to track how users respond to ads we place on third-party sites or applications. These features may also be included in our email newsletters so that we can learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. In combination with cookies, these web beacons allow us (and/or our Affiliates, Service Providers, vendors, or advertisers) to track the number of users who view particular pages and to fine tune the advertising messages delivered to users of this site and other websites and applications. We may use “clickstream” data collected using web beacons and cookies to help us tailor promotional content, including such content in email messages and on landing pages, to the perceived interests of our users. Advertising networks with which we are affiliated and third-party advertising services that we use may also use web beacons on our site to gather similar anonymous “clickstream” information, which is used to fine tune advertising messages delivered to our visitors and visitors to other websites.
Browser Level Information and IP Addresses. Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer configuration or your mobile device when you visit our site, including the device ID (if applicable), type of browser software you use, the operating system you’re running, the resolution of your computer monitor or mobile device, the website that referred you, the type of device you’re using, and your IP address. (Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers and mobile devices connected to the Internet to identify your computer or mobile device so that data (such as the web pages you want to view) can be transmitted to you. We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. Your IP address alone does not tell us who you are.)

The social network’s use of that information will be subject to its own privacy policy, which may be different from ours.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Why We Collect Information From You. Like any business, it’s important for us to know our customers — their needs, their likes, what they want and expect from us. Unlike most businesses, however, we deliver a valuable product to our customers without asking for anything in return. Since we make most of this site available without charge to you, we rely heavily on advertisers to produce the income necessary to operate the site. Advertisers are like most people: They expect something in return for the money they spend. They want to know how many people will see their ad and how often our users are looking at their ads on our site — in other words, how effective their ad is likely to be. So it’s important that we be able to tell advertisers who our audience is. Except as expressly set forth in this privacy statement, we will not provide, sell or rent to any third party any personally identifying information that we collect from you through your use of this site.
Advertisers. Without your permission, we will not share the personally-identifying information you provide when registering on our site with advertisers. We may, however, take the information you provide and aggregate it with data from all the other people that use this site and associated services. Then we will use that pool of information to inform our advertisers about our audience without identifying you personally.
Service Providers. All or portions of the site may be provided or supported by our third-party service providers (“Service Providers”), and we may share any of the information that we collect from you through our site (e.g., anonymous information collected through cookies on your browser, information you submit to us to enter a contest, sweepstakes or promotion offered through the site, etc.) with such Service Providers. In the event we offer services through this site such as chat, email newsletters, email services, online classifieds and/or similar services, such services may be made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. In some instances, our Service Providers will have the same access to your information as we do. Their use of the information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies.
Contest Co-Sponsors. If you enter any contest, sweepstakes or other promotion that we make available through this site, we may share the information you submit to us with the co-sponsor(s) of the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We will identify any co-sponsor(s) in the official rules for the promotion.
Our Affiliates.  We may share any of the information that we collect from you (including anonymous information and personally identifying information that you may provide) with the other CMG Affiliate Sites within the CMG Network of Sites so that we and they can provide you with products and services that may be of interest to you.
Sites to Which We Link. Our site include may include links to plenty of other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don’t control. When you access another site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through their sites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy statement of the operator of the site you’re visiting or the provider of such products or services.
Other Disclosures. We reserve the right to release information about users of our site when release is necessary or appropriate to comply with law, to enforce this privacy statement or our visitor agreement , or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of our site, the public, our customers, or our company and its employees, agents, partners and Affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we merge with another entity or otherwise transfer substantially all of our assets to another entity (including, without limitation, to one of our Affiliates as part of an internal reorganization), information collected from this site would be among the transferred assets.
