From time to time, we may also make your contact information and other information about you available to other organizations we believe to be reputable, such as companies whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you register on ADA.org to attend an event, the ADA may provide an attendee list to other attendees and to entities that collaborate with the ADA on the event.
With respect to email addresses: We generally do not knowingly disclose individual's e-mail address without the individual's express or implied consent outside the ADA, its service providers, subsidiaries and affiliated entities, ADA members, and state and local dental societies. However, we may disclose your e-mail address in certain situations; for example, if you serve in a leadership capacity or if you provide your e-mail address in connection with an event or an attendee list.
The ADA maintains directories of dentists that may include information you submit via our website. These directories are shared with ADA members and state and local dental societies. A directory containing information about ADA members is publicly accessible on MouthHealthy.org; members may elect to provide additional information, such as email address and photo, through the expanded profile option.

ADA Communities is a digital platform where ADA member dentists, staff members of ADA and state and local dental societies, and others can connect and converse on professional, clinical and personal interests, through a social media interface.  
The following information applies to personal information that ADA collects from users of ADA Communities. In this section, a “user” includes any individual who creates an ADA Communities account, as well as others who have access to ADA Communities, such as employees and independent contractors of ADA and its affiliates, state and local dental associations, and certain service providers and other third parties. For purposes of this section, “affiliate” means an ADA subsidiary or charity, such as ADA Business Enterprises, Inc. (“ADABEI”) and the ADA Foundation.
This ADA Communities section of the Privacy Notice provides information about the personal information that American Dental Association (“ADA”) collects from users of ADA Communities, and how that information is used and shared.
The ADA websites and platform are directed towards users who reside in the United States of America only.  It is not our intent or purpose to gather personally identifiable information from individuals residing outside the U.S. You consent and acknowledge that anything you post or provide on or via ADA Communities, including but not limited to your personal information, may be transferred to, maintained, and processed in the United States in accordance with the applicable Terms of Use and Privacy Notice.

I. What personal information does ADA collect on ADA Communities?
ADA collects information, such as text, posts, links, images, video, messages and other communications, and other data that users create, post, share and provide on ADA Communities, and information about things that users do on ADA Communities. Such information may be combined with other information that ADA has about users. For example, ADA collects:
Information users provide. ADA collects the content and other information, such as the information listed above, that users create, post, share and provide on ADA Communities.
Information about, or incorporated in, other information. ADA collects information that may be incorporated in other information; for example, if a user posts a photo, ADA may collect where and when the photo was taken. ADA collects information about other information, such as the date a file is created. ADA also collects information about users that is created or generated by other users.
Information about what users do. ADA also collects information about things users do on ADA Communities. For example, ADA collects information such as the date a user signs up for ADA Communities, the kinds of content a user views or engages with, how long and often a user is active in ADA Communities, and things a user does on ADA Communities, such as sending messages to other users, or posting information about other users.
Information about groups and connections. ADA collects information about users’ groups and connections, such as the groups a user creates or joins, which other users a user is connected to and how they interact with each other, the groups a user is most likely to share with, and the other users a user communicates with. ADA may also collect contact information from users through ADA Communities.
Information from other websites you visit. For example, ADA may have access to information about websites that users visited prior to coming to ADA Communities. If a user uses the same email address to sign up for ADA Communities and another social media platform powered by the same service provider, ADA may collect and aggregate information based on the information the user provides and things the user does on both platforms. The service provider may also collect and aggregate information based on the information the user provides and things the user does on both websites, and make the information available to the controller of the other platform.
Information about users’ devices. ADA may collect information about the devices used to access ADA Communities, such as computers and phones, and may associate such information to provide consistent service across a user’s devices. Here are some examples of such information:
Attributes such as the operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.
Device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.
Connection information such as the name of users’ mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address.
Information from third parties. ADA receives information about users and their activities on and off ADA Communities from third-parties, such as information from a third party when ADA and the third party jointly offer services, or from an advertiser about a user’s experiences or interactions with the third party or advertiser.
ADA affiliates and state and local dental associations. ADA receives information about users from ADA affiliates, from state and local dental associations, and from other sources.
II. How does ADA use the information it collects on ADA Communities?
ADA uses information that it collects on ADA Communities to help provide and support ADA Communities and other ADA services, to help achieve ADA’s mission, and to help ADA conduct and provide other products, projects, messages, events, initiatives, and for any other lawful purpose. ADA also provides such information to ADA affiliates and state and local dental associations to help them achieve their missions, and to help them conduct and provide their products, projects and initiatives. ADA may combine information that it collects on ADA Communities with information that ADA and others collect elsewhere, such as information ADA collects on ADA.org.
For example, ADA and its affiliates may use information collected on ADA Communities to:
Develop, provide and improve ADA Communities and other products, services, projects and initiatives, both on and off ADA Communities.
Deliver ADA Communities, personalize content, and make suggestions for users by using information about users and others to understand how users use and interact with ADA Communities and the people, groups, ideas and things users are connected to and interested in on and off ADA Communities.
Provide shortcuts and suggestions to users. For example, ADA may be able to suggest that a user connect with another user by comparing information a user provides to information ADA has about another user.
If users provide location information about themselves or others, either directly or indirectly (e.g. such as location information provided as part of a photo), ADA and its affiliates may use such information (e.g., for tailoring ADA Communities for a user and others, helping a user find local events or offers in the area or to tell other users that a user is nearby).
Conduct surveys and research, test features in development, analyze the information to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new products or features, and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.
Send information such as marketing communications, communicate with users about ADA Communities and other products, services and initiatives
Let users know about ADA’s policies and terms, such as changes to Privacy Notices and Terms of Use. ADA also uses users’ information to respond when users contact ADA.
Show and measure ads and services. For example, ADA uses the information that ADA has to improve advertising and measurement systems so ADA can show individuals relevant ads on and off ADA Communities and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads and services.
Promote safety and security; for example, by using information to help verify accounts and activity, and to promote safety and security on and off of ADA Communities, such as by investigating suspicious activity or violations of ADA’s terms or policies.
State and local dental associations may also use information collected on ADA Communities. For example, they may use it to:
Develop, provide and improve their products, services, projects and initiatives.
Personalize content, and make suggestions for users.
Provide shortcuts and suggestions to users.
If users provide location information about themselves or others, use such information for purposes such as helping a user find local events or offers in the area or tell connections that a user is nearby.
Send information such as marketing communications, communicate with users about ADA Communities and other products, services and initiatives.
ADA uses cookies and similar technologies to provide and support ADA Communities and other ADA services, and uses outlined and described in the Privacy Notice.
III. How is this information shared?
ADA member dentists may use ADA Communities to connect and share with others, such as other member dentists and the staff of ADA, affiliates, and state and local dental associations. ADA makes this possible by sharing users’ information in various ways, such as the following:
When users share and communicate using ADA Communities they may choose which group to post to, such as an open or closed group. Likewise, when a user sends a message to another user or users, the sender chooses the recipient(s). Although ADA does not monitor all activity on ADA Communities, ADA may be able to access information on ADA Communities, including but not limited to text, posts, links, images, video, content,  messages and communications (including those that have been deleted), as well as information about things user do on ADA Communities, including those in open groups and in closed groups.  
“Public ADA engagement data” is any information a user shares with all users of ADA Communities such as text based forum posts, images, links to articles and other information users choose to share in the groups, as well as information in users’ Profiles, and content users share on certain other public forums in ADA Communities. Public ADA Communities information is available to all users of ADA Communities and on certain other ADA services and databases.
Other users of ADA Communities may download or re-share content on and off ADA Communities, such as by copying content and making the content public on the Internet. When a user comments on another user’s post or “Upvotes” their content on ADA Communities, if their audience is public, the comment or “Upvote” will also be public to members of ADA Communities. Various people will see content others share about a user. Other users may share information about users on ADA Communities with the audience they choose, on or off ADA Communities. For example, a user may share a photo of a user, mention a user at a location in a post, or share information about a user that the user shared with them.
Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using ADA Communities. When a user uses a third-party app, website or other service that uses, or is integrated with, ADA Communities, the app, website or other service may receive information the user provides, or information about what the user does. For example, when a user engages in discussion with another user or users on ADA Communities, or uses the “Comment,” “Upvote,” or “Share” buttons, the website, app, or service (e.g., the program platform) may get information about the user’s activities or receive a comment or link that the user shares from the website on ADA Communities. In addition, when a user downloads or uses such third-party services, the third-party service can access the user’s Public Profile, which includes the user’s username or user ID, age range and country/language, list of connections, as well as any information that the user shares with them.
New owner or service provider. If the ownership or control of all or part of ADA Communities or its assets changes, ADA may transfer users’ information to the new owner. ADA may also transfer users’ information to new service providers.
Sharing With Third Parties
ADA works with third parties who help ADA provide and improve ADA Communities and other services, or who use or offer advertising or related products, which helps makes it possible to operate ADA Communities and other ADA services and initiatives.
Here are examples of the types of third parties with whom ADA and its affiliates may share information about users. State and local dental societies may also use such data to inform programs with third parties, such as advertisers or sponsors.
Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services. To help make advertising and other messaging relevant and interesting, ADA, its affiliates, and state and local dental associations may use, and provide to advertising, measurement and analytics services entities for their use, information about users; for example, to make decisions concerning ads and messaging. Advertising, measurement and analytics services may provide or be provided information about the reach and effectiveness of advertising and messaging. In some cases the information may be de-identified or aggregated so it does not personally identify a user. For example, ADA may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide personally identifying or non-personally identifying demographic information to help the advertiser understand its audience or customers.
Vendors, service providers and other entities. ADA, its affiliates and state and local dental associations may transfer user information to vendors, service providers, and others who support their missions, products, services and initiatives, such as providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how products and services are used, measuring the effectiveness of ads and services, providing member services, facilitating payments, or conducting research and surveys.
IV. How can users manage or delete information about themselves?
ADA stores data and makes it available as provided in the applicable Privacy Notice for as long as it is necessary (for example, to be able to provide products and services to users and others, including those described herein). Information associated with a user’s account may be kept until the account is deleted, unless the data is no longer needed (for example, to provide products and services).
A user may delete his or her account any time. When a user deletes his or her account, the things the user posted, such as comments and photos, will no longer be visible on ADA Communities. If a user does not want to delete his or her account, but wants to temporarily stop using ADA Communities, the user may deactivate the account instead. If a user deletes his or her account, keep in mind that information that others have shared about the user is not part of the account and will not be deleted.
If a user deletes information, such as a post, or deletes his or her account, ADA may continue to maintain the post, account, or other information even if it is no longer visible on ADA Communities.
V. How does ADA respond to legal requests or prevent harm?
ADA may access, preserve and share a user’s information in response to a legal request (such as a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if ADA has a good faith belief doing so is required by law or would help protect ADA or an individual or entity from legal, reputational, financial, physical, or any other harm. ADA may also access, preserve and share information when ADA has a good faith belief it is necessary or appropriate to do so; for example, in order to:
detect, prevent and address potential fraud and other illegal activity
protect the Association, its affiliates, state and local dental societies, users and others, including as part of investigations
help prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
For example, ADA may provide information to third parties about a user’s account to prevent potential fraud and abuse or a potential antitrust violation on and off of ADA Communities. Information ADA has and receives about users, including financial transaction data related to purchases made, may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of ADA’s terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. ADA also may retain information from posts and content or accounts disabled or deleted for any reason, such as violations of ADA terms, to prevent repeat abuse or other violations of ADA’s terms or to prevent other harms, or to comply with laws and legal requests.
VI. How will ADA notify users of changes to this ADA Communities Privacy Notice?
ADA will notify users before making changes to this ADA Communities section of the Privacy Notice and give users the opportunity to review the revised Privacy Notice before continuing to use ADA Communities.
