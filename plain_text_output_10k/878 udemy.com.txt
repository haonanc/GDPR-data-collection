Do you currently run a website or looking to start a website? 
Do you want to protect your website? 
Do you want to write a Terms and Condition or Privacy Policy for your website without costly lawyer fees?
Over 90% of websites and blogs are in violation of a state, federal, or global privacy laws because of inadequate Terms and Condition or Privacy Policy on their website.
Terms and Conditions is a set of rules between you, the website owner, and the visitors of your website.
Having a Terms and Conditions protects your website by preventing abuses, it sets a notice to your readers that you own the content on your website, it allows you to terminate user accounts, sets governing laws, and most importantly, limits your liability.
Having a Terms and Conditions makes sure you’ll have some kind of disclaimer aimed at limiting your liability in case there are errors in your online content.
According to most countries’ privacy laws, including United State’s, you are required to have a written Privacy Policy on your website. 
Privacy Policy discloses some or all of the ways the website owner gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a user’s data. A privacy policy fulfills the legal requirement to protect a website visitor’s privacy.
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy are a must for every website or online business.

I'll also cover a second page you will need for your website, called the Privacy Policy. I’ll cover what a Privacy Policy is, when you need a privacy policy, 3 important reasons why you need a privacy policy, and I’ll even provide a sample privacy policy you can use for your website.

Simply put, a Terms and Conditions agreement is the rules that one must agree to in order to use websites, mobile applications, and other online platforms.
Consider your Terms and Conditions agreement a legally-binding contract between you and your users (those can be visitors to your website or registered accounts users) and include all the disclosures you need to keep your website or mobile app away from abuses or misuse (including spam or other fraudulent activities.) These agreements include guidelines for acceptable behavior, rules against users abusing your website or mobile app and many more useful sections.
There are several names for this kind of agreement and all names refer to the same agreement: Terms and Conditions, Terms of Use, and Terms of Service.
Because of the importance of a Terms and Condition, here are 5 reasons why you should have a Terms and Conditions for your website if you own a website or if you’re a blogger...
Reason #1: This is the agreement that sets the rules and guidelines that users must agree to and follow in order to use and access your website or mobile app. In this agreement, you can include the necessary sections to inform users of the guidelines of using your website or mobile app, what happens if users are abusing your website or mobile app, and so on.

They may be used to satisfy legal disclosure obligations, to grant users rights to use website materials, to impose acceptable use obligations, to limit (or attempt to limit) warranties and disclaim (or attempt to disclaim) liabilities, and more generally to structure the legal relationships between the website operator and users.

As website users become increasingly aware of the importance of protecting their personal information online, the need for websites to include comprehensive privacy policies is more important than ever.
Even if you have a simple blog, and only collect subscriber email addresses for a monthly newsletter, it’s important to let users know what information you gather, how that information will be used, and who will have access to it, in a privacy policy.
A privacy policy is a legal document that discloses some or all of the ways the website owner gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a user’s data.
So why would you need a Privacy Policy?
First and foremost, for most countries, including United States, it’s required by law!
Second, one of the biggest concerns among visitors to Web sites is how their personal information is going to be used. In today's world of trying to be anonymous and expecting privacy from outsiders, the privacy policy is that much more important to many website users and online customers.
And third, because having a Privacy Policy acts as another effective way of being transparent and building trust with your customers and clients.

So, how do you create a privacy policy that properly reflects your business or blog?

Readers and customers won’t find a policy helpful if they can’t decipher the meaning behind the legal jargon.
So there’s 3 ways you can create your privacy policy...
