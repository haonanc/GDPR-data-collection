LDS LINKUP PRIVACY POLICY
LDS LinkUp values your  privacy.  The following Privacy Statement describes our privacy  practices.
LDS LINKUP  PRIVACY STATEMENT
WHO NEW LLC (“Who New LLC”) owns  and operates online networking web sites, including www.ldslinkup.com ("LDS LinkUp").  Because we value our users' privacy and want to demonstrate our commitment to  protecting it, we are disclosing our information and privacy practices. This privacy statement  discloses and describes the privacy practices of the website www.ldslinkup.com .   
About LDS LinkUp and its  Use of Information
LDS LinkUp is an online  community that allows its members to post personal profiles and to  browse or search personal profiles posted by others in order to identify and  contact new people they might want to meet.  The profiles can contain personal  information about, among other things, a member's appearance, ethnicity,  profession, religion, and interests.  The profiles may also contain  photographs.  Collecting this information from members and providing  services that enable members to search or browse through such profiles is  fundamental to LDS LinkUp's business. 
At the same time, LDS LinkUp is dedicated to  protecting its  members' privacy.  LDS LinkUp is designed to give its members more control  over their personal information, including their LDS LinkUp profiles, than  traditional online dating services.  Through its " Visibility  Preference " setting, LDS LinkUp allows each member choice as to who can see his or  her personal profile.  In particular, LDS LinkUp allows each member to restrict viewership  of his or her profile to  LDS LinkUp  members only, or, if he or she wishes, to  all website visitors.
Who New LLC is the sole owner of  the information collected on www.ldslinkup.com .
Links
The LDS LinkUp web site may  contain links  to other sites. Please be aware that LDS LinkUp is not responsible for the  privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when  they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web  site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement  applies solely to information collected by this Web site.  
Third Party Advertising
Advertisements  appearing on www.ldslinkup.com may be  delivered to users by external advertising partners or networks.  In that event, information about users’ visits to  the site,  such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not the user's name,  email address, or other Personally Identifying Information), may be used to serve appropriate advertisements.  In most cases, third-party advertising networks will use cookie technology to  deliver relevant ads.  Some or all of our third-party advertising networks  may belong to the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), which provides users the  opportunity to opt out of their cookie program.  For more information  please visit the NAI's opt-out page .
Please note that this privacy statement covers the  practices of LDS LinkUp and does not cover the practices any  advertisers or other business partners.  Also note that this privacy  statement covers information collected by LDS LinkUp; it does not cover information  users give directly to advertisers or other business partners. 
What Information  LDS LinkUp Collects
LDS LinkUp collects six types of information about  its users:
ID and contact information - Includes    Members' names and email addresses.
Profile Information (excluding photographs) - Includes information supplied by each Member for his or her personal LDS LinkUp    profile. Profiles may include information on member's appearance,    ethnicity, profession, religion, interests, and other descriptive information    provided by the Member.  It    may also include information about what the Member is looking for in a    potential match.  LDS LinkUp may supplement this information in a Member's    profile with limited activity information, for example, when a Member    joined LDS LinkUp or how recently the Member has logged in to LDS LinkUp.  Note    that LDS LinkUp prohibits inclusion of Personally Identifying Information (see    below) other than photographs in its profiles.
Photographs -    Includes photographs uploaded or otherwise transmitted by Members as part of    their LDS LinkUp profiles.
Messaging Information - Includes the    text, sender, addressee, and time sent of email messages sent through the LDS LinkUp email system.  These messages include invitations to join LDS LinkUp and messages to other Who    New members who may be potential matches.
Discussion Information - Includes the    text, poster, and time sent of discussion board messages posted to the LDS LinkUp    discussion board system. 
Billing Information - Includes credit    card and billing address information necessary to complete credit card transactions to    pay for LDS LinkUp services.
Activity Information - Includes    information about how a user uses the LDS LinkUp website and service, for    example, which pages are visited, which services are used, when a user joined    LDS LinkUp, when a user last logged in to LDS LinkUp, etc.  Activity    information may also include how a user came to LDS LinkUp, including promotion    codes, etc.
Where LDS LinkUp Collects Information
LDS LinkUp collects this  information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
Sign-Up
To become a member, a user must provide ID and  contact information to enable LDS LinkUp to create a unique member ID for him  or her.  During sign-up, new members are also encouraged to begin creating  their personal profiles and to invite friends to join LDS LinkUp. 
Because of LDS LinkUp's model,  non-members cannot view LDS LinkUp's member profiles, unless members have  explicitly chosen to make their profiles visible to non-members.
Edit Your  Profile/Preferences
Once a member has joined LDS LinkUp, he can edit his  personal profile, post or unpost his profile, or change his account preferences  at any time. 
Subscription
If a member decides to subscribe to paid LDS LinkUp services, we will request billing information from the member via our  subscription  form.  At that point, the member must provide billing name and address information  and  payment information (such as credit card number, expiration date, etc.) needed  to complete the transaction.  Because LDS LinkUp subscriptions typically renew  automatically, LDS LinkUp typically stores billing information to allow renewal  transactions.
Invitation/Messaging
When a member invites a friend to join LDS LinkUp or  sends a message through the LDS LinkUp system to another LDS LinkUp member, LDS LinkUp  collects the text and the addressee of the message.  When a member invites  a friend, LDS LinkUp also collects the friend’s name and email address and sends an email inviting  the friend to visit the site.  LDS LinkUp stores the friend's information for  the sole purpose of sending this  email and one or more follow up emails and tracking the success of our  referral program.  The friend may contact LDS LinkUp at removeme@ldslinkup.com to request the removal of  his name and email address from our database.
Discussion Boards
When a member posts a message to an LDS LinkUp  discussion board, LDS LinkUp collects the text and the posting time of the  message, for the purpose of displaying the message on the indicated discussion  board.  Except where explicitly stated on the site, LDS LinkUp does not  allow members to remove posts once they have been posted.
Other  Activities
When a member or other visitor visits the LDS LinkUp web site, LDS LinkUp  may collect activity information about the member's activities, such as  how often he visits, which pages he visits, and which LDS LinkUp services he uses.  This information is used for improving the  LDS LinkUp web site and service offering and for refining our marketing programs.
How LDS LinkUp Collects Information
Besides asking  its users to provide information for their profile or for billing purposes, LDS  LinkUp uses, or may in the future use, several different technologies (including  cookies, log files, and clear gifs) to collect and track activity information.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of data  stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.  There  are two types of cookies, temporary cookies, which disappear when the user is  inactive for a period of time (typically 10-20 minutes) or when he closes  his browser, and persistent cookies, which are stored for a longer period.  A persistent cookie is a small text file  stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent  cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help directions.
LDS LinkUp uses  temporary  cookies to manage user sessions and to prevent unauthorized users from viewing  member profiles.  LDS LinkUp uses persistent cookies to remember a user's  login information so that, if a user wishes, he can return to site after a  period of time without having to retype his login email and password.  Because controlling access to  member profiles is central to LDS LinkUp's offering, users who reject all cookies  will not be able to use the member areas of our site.   
In the future, LDS LinkUp  business partners (for example, advertisers) may use cookies on our site.  Although LDS LinkUp will review each partner's privacy policy prior to agreeing to allow cookies,  LDS LinkUp will have no access to or control over these cookies once we have  given a partner permission to set them. 
Log Files
Like most standard Web site servers we use log  files.  These files collect user internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser  types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types,  date/time stamps, and click counters, among other date.  This data is used  to analyze trends, administer the site, identify technical problems, track users'  movements in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for  aggregate use.    
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We, or our business partners, may also employ a software technology called clear  gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the content of  our site our our communications with our members. Clear gifs are tiny  graphics with a unique identifier that let us know when particular pages or  emails are accessed by users.  
Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from  the same Web site or advertising company.  That means, for example, that if a  person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company's clear  gif, the Web site  or advertising company could match the clear gif's  identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past  online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be  given to the advertising company  or Web site.  At present, LDS LinkUp does not  use clear gifs in this way.
In addition, we may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which  emails have been opened by the recipients.  This allows us to gauge the  effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing  campaigns.
Supplemental Information
In order for LDS LinkUp to deliver the highest  quality services to its users, we may decide to supplement the information we  gather via our web site with information from 3rd party sources.  At this  time, LDS LinkUp does not use information from such external sources.
Personally Identifying Information
In the course of its business,  LDS LinkUp collects information that identifies particular Members (Personally  Identifying Information).  Of the seven types of information LDS LinkUp  collects, five are Personally Identifying Information:  ID and Contact  Information, Photographs, Messaging Information, Discussion Information, and Billing Information.  See below for LDS LinkUp's policy on sharing Personally Identifying Information.
How LDS LinkUp  Uses Information
LDS LinkUp's uses of information  depend on the category of information: ID/contact information, profile  information, messaging information, discussion information, billing information, or activity  information.  In addition to the primary uses described below, LDS LinkUp may  use information for other purposes including, but not restricted to,  investigating user complaints, enforcing our Online Conduct standards (see our Terms of Service ), or  communicating with law enforcement.
Identification and Contact Information
We use Members' ID and contact information to
create a unique Member ID that we use to  allow Members to log in to Members-only areas of the site and to ensure that  each Member can view appropriate profiles from other Members and control who  views his or her own profile
facilitate (or block)  anonymous email communication between Members so that Members can exchange  messages with potential matches without divulging their contact information
communicate with our  Members regarding the status of their LDS LinkUp Membership and LDS LinkUp services.  Note that Members can opt out of receiving promotional communications.
Profile Information (excluding photos)
We use profile information users provide  about themselves and what they are seeking in a match
in Members' personal profiles.  Each Member can view or edit his profile at any time
to match specific profiles  with searches done by other Members looking for potential matches with  particular characteristics
to match specific new  profiles with LDS LinkUp Agent criteria set by Members who want to be notified when  new Members with particular characteristics join LDS LinkUp
Please note that which Who  New users can view a Member's profile is determined by a) whether the Member and  the user  are "connected," i.e., part of the same LDS LinkUp group, b) whether the  user is a LDS LinkUp Member, and c) the " Visibility Preference " setting of the profile Member.  Members can change their Visibility  Preference at any time to exercise a measure of control over who views their  profile.
Photographs
We use Members' photographs as part of their personal profiles.
Messaging Information
We use the text and addressee information  of invitation emails sent a) to invite people to join LDS LinkUp and b) between LDS LinkUp members to
allow members to review  messages they have sent and received
analyze which invitation  email text is most effective in getting invitees to join
Discussion Information
We use discussion  information collected to provide discussion board services to our members.
Billing Information
We use billing information collected from our members  to execute payments for LDS LinkUp subscription  services.
Activity Information
We use activity information to improve LDS LinkUp's web site, service offerings, and marketing programs by, among other  things,
tracking how users move  through the site
measuring which functions are  more or less popular
determining which marketing  messages are most effective in communicating LDS LinkUp's value proposition to  potential members
Communications from LDS  LinkUp
Special  Offers and Updates
We send all new members a  welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will  occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a  newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to  not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out  sections.
Service  Announcements
On rare occasions it is  necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For  instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send  users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications,  though they can deactivate their account.  However, these communications  are not promotional in nature.
Customer  Service
We communicate by email with users on a regular basis to  provide requested services and regarding account issues.
With Whom  LDS LinkUp Shares Information

We provide the information to trusted    partners who work on behalf of or with LDS LinkUp under confidentiality    agreements. These companies may use your information to help LDS LinkUp    communicate with you about offers from LDS LinkUp and our marketing partners.    However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this    information.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or    legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against    legal claims;
We believe it is necessary to share    information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal    activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the    physical safety of any person, violations of LDS LinkUp's Terms of Service, or as    otherwise required by law
We transfer information about you if LDS LinkUp    is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, LDS LinkUp will    notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to    a different privacy policy.

Aggregate Information
LDS LinkUp from time to time shares  aggregated information (not Personally Identifying) about our users with  business partners and advertisers. 
User Choices Regarding  Collection, Use and  Distribution of the Information
LDS LinkUp  gathers Activity Information on users  who visit LDS LinkUp's web site but do not join.  Invitees who choose not to  join LDS LinkUp can request the removal of their ID and Contact Information from  LDS LinkUp's database (see below).  With the exception of ID and Contact  Information, which they are required to provide, and Activity Information, which  is collected automatically, users who join LDS LinkUp and become Members can provide  as much or as little information as they wish when solicited at LDS LinkUp's web  site.  Members can also choose not to post a LDS LinkUp profile or to take  down their profile at any time after it is  posted.
In addition, LDS LinkUp gives its members the  following options for controlling their personal information.  Members can  edit these preferences at www.ldslinkup.com/members/edit_account_preferences.asp .
Visibility Preference
LDS LinkUp members can exercise  a measure of control over who can view their LDS LinkUp profile by adjusting their " Visibility Preference ."  This allows members to make their profile visible just to LDS LinkUp members or to  all LDS LinkUp visitors, including non-Members.
Opt-out from LDS LinkUp Promotional Messages
Members who do not wish to  receive update and promotional messages may opt-out of receiving these  communications by changing their Promotional Email Preference at the address given above.
Make Membership Inactive
LDS LinkUp members can at any  time make their membership inactive.  This takes down their LDS LinkUp profile  and opts the member out of receiving update messages.  The member also can  no longer use most of LDS LinkUp' functionality.  Note that personal  information of inactive members may be retained in LDS LinkUp's database
Request Removal of Information
Members who decide to leave  LDS LinkUp or invitees who choose not to join can request that their name and  email address  actually be removed from LDS LinkUp's database by sending an email from their email  address of record to CustomerService@ldslinkup.com  Subject: Remove Me .
Security Procedures in Place to Protect the  Loss, Misuse or Alteration of Information Under LDS LinkUp Control
LDS LinkUp is committed to keeping  our Members' information secure and we've taken steps to protect sensitive  information both online and offline.
ID/Contact and Profile  Information
Users who are not LDS LinkUp  Members do not have access to LDS LinkUp Member profiles, except for those profiles  where a Member has specifically chosen to have his or her profile visible to all  LDS LinkUp visitors/users.  Otherwise, LDS LinkUp requires to become Members and to  log in to use LDS LinkUp's Service, including viewing other Members' profiles or  viewing/editing their own personal  information.  Each Members-only page  checks that the Member is logged in and that the Member has permission to view the  page in question.  LDS LinkUp uses a combination of cookies and other  technologies to enforce that only permitted viewers can view sensitive LDS LinkUp  content.
Billing Information
When our subscription/order form asks  Members  to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number or billing  address), that information is encrypted and protected with industry-standard,  128-bit SSL technology.  While on a secure page,  the lock icon on the bottom of  web browsers such as Netscape  Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer is locked, as opposed to un-locked, or  open, when users are on a normal page. Credit card numbers that are stored  in our database are encrypted using sophisticated encryption algorithms.
Offline Security
While we use SSL encryption to protect  sensitive information online, we also work to protect  user-information offline.  All of our Members’ information, not just the  sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only  employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a  billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to  Personally Identifying Information. 
If users have any questions about the  security at our Web site, users can send an email to CustomerService@ldslinkup.com Subject: Security .
How Users Can Correct  Any Inaccuracies in the  Information
If a member’s personally  identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal  address), the member can update the information at any time at www.ldslinkup.com/members/edit.asp .  If a member no longer wants to use our service, he can render his membership  inactive at the Member Preferences page ( www.ldslinkup.com/members/edit_account_preferences.asp ).  If a member wants to delete all his name and email address from our system, he can  send an email request to CustomerService@ldslinkup.com  Subject: Remove Me . This email must me sent from his  currently active LDS LinkUp email  address.
How LDS  LinkUp Will Notify Users of Changes to its Privacy Statement
If LDS LinkUp decides to change our privacy policy, we  will notify our Members by posting the changes to this Privacy Statement.  We may also post notice of the changes to our homepage and/or other places we  believe are appropriate. 
Unless we have Members' explicit consent, we will  use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the  information was collected.  If, however, we plan to use Members’ Personally  Identifying Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of  collection, Members will be offered a choice (via email to their currently  active LDS LinkUp email address) as to  whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  Members  who have resigned their membership or otherwise been removed from our system  will not be contacted, and their Personally Identifying Information will not be  used in this new manner.
