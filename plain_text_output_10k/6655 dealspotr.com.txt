(All of the foregoing personally identifiable information shall be referred to hereafter as "Personal Information.")
We may combine the Personal Information you submit under your account with information from other ZipfWorks Services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services.

Depending on the Outside Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Outside Accounts and on your account with ZipfWorks, the information you make accessible via your Outside Accounts (including Personal Information) will be available to ZipfWorks and on and through your ZipfWorks account.
In addition to using your Personal Information to provide the Services, we may also use this information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including the website's Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. In addition, we reserve the right to audit your eligibility or to audit user accounts for possible fraudulent activity.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to the Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, occupation, language, unique device identifier, approximate geographic location, and the time zone.

Personal information that you provide to those sites may be sent to ZipfWorks in order to deliver Services.

As such, we strongly recommend that you review their privacy policies before undertaking such interactions.

Other Sharing of User Information
ZipfWorks only process Personal Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information about Users (collectively referred to hereafter as "User Information") for the purposes described in the applicable Privacy Policy and/or privacy notice for specific services. In addition to the circumstances described above, ZipfWorks may also share, release and/or disclose User Information to outside parties in the following circumstances:
We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers. We provide certain Services through third party service providers. These "Third Party Service Providers" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share User Information with such Third Party Service Providers to remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies ("Affiliates") with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Third Party Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. However, we do not grant these entities any rights to use and contractually restrict them from using any information for any purpose other than providing service to us and you.
We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. Please note that this is not Personal Information as defined above, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.
We may share your information in a Business Transfer. As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by, another company, or we may file for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws in the future. In such event, User Information obtained and maintained by ZipfWorks websites, including Personal Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information, will transfer to a successor entity in connection with the corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change. User Information submitted prior to any such transfer would remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy (as it existed on the date of the submission). However, User Information submitted after a transfer to a successor entity may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.
We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others. We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use or other agreements; or investigate, prevent, or take action suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or to prevent financial loss to any person or entity; or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of our websites, its Users or others.
Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management or use of personal data.
User Choices on Collection and Use of Information
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide User Information, although it may be required to use all or parts of the Services offered by ZipfWorks websites.
If you register for an account or otherwise submit User Information to the website or through the Services, we will send you administrative email messages. We will send you information regarding your account activity and transactions with us, as well as updates about our Services and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of these Administrative Emails. "Administrative Emails" relate to a User's activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User's account, requests or inquiries. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails solely function to advertise our Services, including sales and other offers by Third Party Websites, Third Party Service Providers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at contact@zipfworks.com , by writing to us at the address contained herein, or by hitting the "unsubscribe" button at the bottom of any of our e-mails.
User Information Security
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
We restrict access to personal information to ZipfWorks employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with service providers which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the ZipfWorks websites, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.
Account Information and other password-protected areas of our websites can be accessed only with a valid user name and password. Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password confidential and safe, as ZipfWorks has no control or responsibility for this type of User Information. If the password may have been stolen or might otherwise be misused, it is the responsibility of the subject User to notify ZipfWorks immediately for further action.
Public Areas of Our Websites
We may provide areas on the website where you can publicly post information about yourself, can communicate with others such as discussion boards or blogs, or can review products, and submit media content. By engaging in such conduct, you acknowledge your understanding that any such information you supply may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and therefore this information could be read, collected, and used by others throughout the world. For example, if you post your email address along with a product or service review, you may receive unsolicited messages from other registered users. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information. We do obtain consent from our users to post their name along with their reviews.
Children
Minors (those under the age of 18) may not use the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18, and no part of the website is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18. Because we do not intentionally collect any information from children under the age of 18, we also do not knowingly share or disclose such information to third parties. If you have reason to believe that a child under 18 years of age has provided us with information, please contact us at contact@zipfworks.com and we will take appropriate action under applicable law.
Data Integrity
ZipfWorks processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
Accessing and Updating Account Information
When you use ZipfWorks Services (including create an account through one of our websites), we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.
Enforcement
ZipfWorks regularly reviews its compliance with this Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or ZipfWorks' treatment of User Information by contacting us at contact@ZipfWorks.com. When we receive formal written complaints at this address, it is ZipfWorks' policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between ZipfWorks and an individual.

If you are a User accessing our websites from the European Union, Australia, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, you are transferring your personal data to the United States which may not have the same data protection laws as such other regions.
