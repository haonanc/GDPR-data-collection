Privacy Policy
GIANT® Food Stores, (GIANT) believes in protecting the confidentiality of customer information in accordance with our customers' wishes and applicable laws. Our reason for collecting customer information is to help us deliver greater value and improve the shopping experience of our customers. The GIANT BonusCard is our primary means of collecting such information which helps us to target benefits and services to our customers. This may include advising our customers about products, services and other opportunities.

What is Customer Information?
Customer Information is information about you that is obtained by GIANT in connection with providing a product or service for personal, family or household purposes. Some Customer Information is general and not specifically about you. For example, we may collect and use aggregate sales information or purchase data to determine purchasing trends. Because this aggregated information cannot be linked to any individual, it is not protected by this policy.

If you elect to have check cashing privileges at our stores, it may also include your social security number, checking account number and/or driver's license number.
This privacy policy does not include GIANT pharmacy records. Pharmacy records are kept separate from other Customer Information and maintained in accordance with the privacy and other requirements of Federal and state law. Please speak to your pharmacist for additional information.
