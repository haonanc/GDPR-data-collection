Except where section 3.6 may apply, we don't store or use your personal information or use it after you receive your result.
Section 8 below explains what to do if you change your mind and decide you don't want to hear from us anymore about these things we think you'd be interested in.
All personal information that we hold to enable your use of the MSE Personalised Tools can be deleted by you when you use the relevant MSE Personalised Tool.  Alternatively, you can email us to request we delete your personal information for you at DataRequest@moneysavingexpert.com .
3.5. Forum
We collect and use your email and IP address to enable you to post on our Forum. We use your email address to send you your password to enable you to log in to our Forum and to send you email notices if you have elected to receive them.  We also use your email and IP addresses for admin, troubleshooting and investigatory purposes.
3.6. Internal reporting, insight and analysis
We may also use the personal information  referred to in this section 3 to generate aggregated, anonymised data for the  purposes of internal reporting, insight and analysis, enabling us to improve  and personalise our Site, the products we offer and search results for our  Site. Where necessary this exercise may be carried out on our behalf by a third  party  please see section 7 below.
3.7. Site personalisation

Any feedback you provide will only be used to improve our Site and will  not be published. However, if we contact you about this, you do not have to  take part in the activities;
3.8.3 award you  a prize if you have won a competition we're running.
If you're providing us with another person's personal information you  should first ask them to read this Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions . By giving us personal information about another person  you are confirming that they have given you consent to provide the personal  information to us and that they understand how their details will be used.
We will periodically review your personal information to ensure that we  do not keep it for longer than is permitted by law (see section 12 below).
4. Why do we process your personal information?
We will only collect  and use your personal information (as described in sections 2 and 3) in  accordance with data protection laws.   Our grounds for processing your personal information are as follows:
Consent   Where necessary we will only collect and process your personal information if  you have consented for us to do so. For example, when you register to use Cheap  Energy Club, we will use your personal information to provide the services  detailed at section 3.4.1.
Legitimate  Interests  We may use and process some of your personal information where we have  sensible and legitimate business grounds for doing so.  Under European privacy laws there is a  concept of "legitimate interests" as a justification  for processing your personal information. Our legitimate interests for  processing your personal information are:
to enable you to access and use the Site;
to communicate with you about your use of the MSE Personalised Tools.  For example, sending you a confirmation email of  your search results after you have used the MSE Personalised Tools.  Unless you have agreed, this won't include  communications about consumer news, other MSE Personalised Tools, other  MoneySaving tips, products and exclusives which we think you may be interested  in; and
to improve our Site. We may use your personal information to undertake  demographic segmentation and generate profiling information to help us  understand what you might be interested in and for market research.  We are always working to make a better Site  for you and using your personal information in this way helps us to do this.
From May 2018, you will  have a right to object to our use of your personal information for these  legitimate interests, including a right to object to profiling by us (see  section 8 below).
5. Use of children's personal information
We do not knowingly collect or store any  personal information about children under the age of 16.  If you are aged under 16 please get your  parent or guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to  us.
6. Sharing your personal information with MoneySupermarket Group
We are part of the MoneySupermarket Group  comprising the following brands:  MoneySupermarket.com, TravelSupermarket.com and MoneySupermarket Go, and all operate in the UK.  MoneySavingExpert.com's specific way of operating is governed by the legally  binding Editorial Code . This includes that:
6.1. Any personal  information about you, including contact details (as opposed to aggregated or  anonymised user behaviour data), we gather while operating our Site shall not  be tracked or otherwise used by MoneySupermarket Group without your informed  consent and the express permission of MoneySavingExpert.com's Executive  Chairman (except for internal reporting, accounting or compliance purposes);
6.2. If you give separate informed consent for your  personal information to be shared across the MoneySupermarket Group it may then  be used to speed up form filling, or to personalise or improve your experience  if you then go to those websites;
6.3. If we send you directly to MoneySupermarket  Group's websites or you visit them independently, your personal information  shall be subject to those websites' privacy policies; and
6.4. Any of your personal information, including  contact details, gathered while operating our Site shall not be sold to third  parties or used for the purposes of unsolicited communications from other parts  of the MoneySupermarket Group.
7. Disclosure of your personal information to other organisations
The personal information that we collect when  you use our Site is confidential.  We may  disclose your personal information to a third party in the following  circumstances:
7.1. Our service providers  as described in sections 3.5 to 3.7 and 6 above, and for the  purposes of providing certain services and enabling your interaction with the Site, such as your use of MSE Personalised Tools. These include:
7.1.1. Experian Ltd ("Experian")   we operate Credit Club in conjunction with UK credit reference agency  Experian. By submitting your details to Credit Club, you are consenting to them  being passed to Experian and to us letting you know every time your Experian  Credit Score or Experian Credit Report has been updated. For further  information about how your details will be used,  please see the rest of our Privacy Policy and  Experian's terms and conditions ;
7.1.2. Capital One Plc ("Capital  One") and HD Decisions, an Experian business ("HD")   we operate the eligibility tools in  conjunction with Capital One and HD which partners with the following UK credit  reference agencies: Callcredit Limited ("Callcredit"), Equifax  Limited ("Equifax") and Experian from time to time.   We will use the personal information you  submit to enable your interaction with our eligibility tools. If you use our eligibility  tools a credit report will be generated by carrying out a 'soft' credit check.  'Soft' credit checks allow you to get quotes without affecting your creditworthiness. The 'soft' credit checks will be used by Capital One to match  against their lending criteria and HD to match against other providers'   lending criteria. Capital One and HD's information is then used to let you know  your percentage chances of successfully obtaining a credit card or loan. Note  that your credit report will not be provided to you directly and we will not  receive it either. By submitting your details, you are consenting to Capital  One and HD passing them to Callcredit, Equifax and/or Experian. For further  information about how your details will be used, please see the rest of our  Privacy Policy and Capital One's terms and conditions and HD's terms and  conditions .
Our technical partners will not be permitted to  use your personal information for their own marketing purposes unless you have  consented to receive marketing from them on another site, as we won't ask for  your permission to do this on our Site.
7.2. If required or permitted to do so by law;
7.3. If required to do so by any court, the  Financial Conduct Authority or any other applicable regulatory, compliance,  governmental or law enforcement agency;
7.4. If necessary in connection with legal  proceedings or potential legal proceedings;
7.5. If ownership of all or part of our Site is  transferred, in which case any purchaser would only be entitled to use that  information in a way consistent with this Privacy Policy; and
7.6. In line with our own Terms and Conditions (in particular section 8 regarding reporting offending Forum users to  their ISP or to the authorities if their actions appear to amount to a crime).
8. How  you can change permissions
Your privacy is of huge importance to us. All  emails or other forms of communication directly from us to you will include  clear instructions on how to unsubscribe. Plus, if you don't want to be  contacted by us anymore you can email DataRequest@moneysavingexpert.com . Section 9 below  also sets out your other information rights.
9. Your information rights and responsibilities

10. Cookies
10.1. We use cookies (files which are sent by us to  your computer or other access device) and tracking technology to help to  improve the functionality and performance of our Site.
10.2. The information derived from our use of cookies  will be aggregated to provide statistical information about the usage of our  Site. However, we do not use any information derived from cookies, nor any IP  addresses we collect, to identify any individual user of our Site.

11. Keeping your personal information secure
11.1. Keeping information about you secure is very  important to us so we store and process your personal information in accordance  with the high standards required under data protection legislation. From time  to time and for operational reasons the personal information we collect from  you may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the European  Economic Area ("EEA").  Your information may also be processed by some of our service providers which  operate outside the EEA. Different countries have different data protection and  security laws and some of these do not offer the same level of protection as  you enjoy under UK data protection legislation.  However, when we appoint our service providers  to help us provide products and services to you (which may include some based  in the USA), we take care to ensure that they have appropriate security  measures in place.
11.2. We do our best to keep the information you  disclose to us secure. However, we can't guarantee its security. By using our  Site you accept the inherent risks of providing information online and will not  hold us responsible for any breach of security.
12. How long do we keep your personal information?
Unless a longer retention period is required or  permitted by law, we will only hold your personal information on our systems  for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy  or until you request it is deleted. If, having registered for any of our  services, you do not use them for a reasonable time  (which may vary depending on the service(s)  you've registered for) we may contact you to ensure you're still happy to  receive communications from us.  Even if we delete your personal information it may persist on back-up  or archival media for legal, tax or regulatory purposes.
13. How to contact us
Our Data Protection  Officer is MoneySupermarket Group's Chief Risk Officer.
If you have any queries relating to our use of  your personal information or any other related data protection questions,  please contact us at  DataRequest@moneysavingexpert.com or write to us at MoneySavingExpert.com  Limited, at MoneySupermarket House, St. David's Park, Ewloe, Flintshire, CH5 3UZ.

How this site works
We think it's important you understand the strengths and limitations of the site. We're a journalistic website and aim to provide the best MoneySaving guides, tips, tools and techniques, but can't guarantee to be perfect, so do note you use the information at your own risk and we can't accept liability if things go wrong.
This info does not constitute financial advice, always do your own research on top to ensure it's right for your specific circumstances and remember we focus on rates not service.
Do note, while we always aim to give you accurate product info at the point of publication, unfortunately price and terms of products and deals can always be changed by the provider afterwards, so double check first.
We don't as a general policy investigate the solvency of companies mentioned (how likely they are to go bust), but there is a risk any company can struggle and it's rarely made public until it's too late (see the Section 75 guide for protection tips).
We often link to other websites, but we can't be responsible for their content.
Always remember anyone can post on the MSE forums, so it can be very different from our opinion.
MoneySavingExpert.com is part of the MoneySupermarket Group, but is entirely editorially independent. Its stance of putting consumers first is protected and enshrined in the legally-binding MSE Editorial Code .
