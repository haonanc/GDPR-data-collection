How We Use Information
For Internet-based Advertising and Improvement of our End-Users Experience
We use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “Information”) for purposes of analyzing trends, administering our Offering, improving our services, and to gather demographic information about our End User base as a whole. We also compile and store data and information and generate reports related to our End Users’ access to and use of our Offering. To the extent required under applicable data processing laws and regulations, any PII that we collect will be stored in our database and will be used in accordance with such applicable laws and regulations.
We typically analyze this information and organize it into user groups and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions. We then use these user groups and audiences, along with information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content. This is often referred to as Interest-Based Advertising. To enable the foregoing, the DY Solutions use technology including browser cookies, device identifiers, and other similar technologies to recognize a particular browser or device over time, to predict possible relationships among different browsers and devices and to then relay this information to our servers.
DY retains the End User data described above which is collected through our DY Solutions for purposes of Interest-Based Advertising for up to twenty-four (24) months from the date of its collection.
