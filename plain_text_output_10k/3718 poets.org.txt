Third-Party Platforms
All donations made to the Academy of American Poets are processed by a secure third-party software called Blackbaud. Credit card information is not retained by the Academy of American Poets except for recurring donations, which are encrypted by the software. Email addresses for all donors and members whose gifts are processed online are automatically enrolled in the Academy of American Poets’ bimonthly e-newsletter; donors may unsubscribe at any time (see Opting Out).
The Academy of American Poets’ email campaigns and newsletters are sent using Campaign Monitor. Refer to  Campaign Monitor’s Privacy Policy for more information about how it handles subscriber data.
The Academy of American Poets does not store credit card information on our website or servers. All payments through our online store are processed by the secure third-party platform Shopify. The Shopify Privacy Policy describes the information it collects during a transaction. 
The Academy of American Poets uses Submittable to manage submissions to some of our awards, such as the Walt Whitman Award. View Submittable’s Privacy Policy for more information about how it handles data.
The Academy of American Poets uses numerous social media platforms to inform and interact with followers. The Academy of American Poets does not share any user data with any of these platforms.

The Academy of American Poets runs advertisements on Poets.org through DoubleClick for Publishers and (via Litbreaker, a third-party ad network) NUI Media. We run nonpersonalized ads, which are ads that are not based on a user’s past behavior. The ads are sometimes targeted using contextual information, including coarse geo-targeting based on current location (at the city-level, but not at the ZIP/postal code-level). We do not run ads that rely on interest-based audience targeting, i.e., demographic targeting or user list targeting. Although nonpersonalized ads don’t use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for ad targeting, they do still use cookies or mobile ad identifiers for frequency capping, aggregated ad reporting, and to combat fraud and abuse.
