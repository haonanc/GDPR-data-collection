Fulfilling Requests for Products & Services
All users must register to use our site to take advantage of our             products and services. During registration, students and guests             are required to give certain contact information (such as name and             email address) and certain demographic information (such as school             year or guest type). Students and guests may also choose to submit             additional contact and demographic information.
We request additional information on our annual subscription signup             form from property managers and other individuals who wish to list             properties on our site. These users must provide additional contact             information (such as billing address and phone number) and financial             information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We             use this information for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.             If we have trouble processing an order, we use this information             to get in touch with the individual.
Research & Reporting
In addition to the personal information you choose to submit, our             systems gather certain anonymous data to help us better understand             how our site is being used and how we can improve it. Like most             standard Web site servers, we use log files to conduct this analysis.             This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet             service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time             stamp, and number of clicks. With this information, we can analyze             trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate,             and gather broad demographic information. IP addresses, etc. are             not linked to personally identifiable information.

Opting In/Out
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of             having their information used for purposes not directly related             to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example,             our registration form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so             users who register for our service but do not want to receive marketing             material can keep their email addresses off of our lists.
Users who no longer wish to receive our update emails or promotional             materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications             by logging onto the site to edit their user profiles or replying             to any e-mail and typing “unsubscribe” in the subject             line.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply             with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.
