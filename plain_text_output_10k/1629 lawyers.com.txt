We provide the details for these procedures in the specific Privacy Policy or FAQs for these services.
For EU residents: please refer to Article 6 below for information on your rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”).

In addition to the above, please find below information which applies to European Union residents only under applicable Data Protection Law, notably the General Data Protection                 Regulation (“GDPR”).
6.1 What are your rights?
Under applicable European Data Protection Law, notably the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), you have a number of rights with regard to your personal data. Those rights are as follows:
Right to Access — You can ask to see the personal information Best Lawyers holds about you. In connection with a request, we may request specific information about you to                     enable us to confirm your identity and right access, as well as search for and provide you with the personal information Best Lawyers holds about you. In the event we cannot provide you                     with access to your personal information (for instance, personal information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous), we will inform you of the reasons why.
Correction or Deletion of Personal Information — Best Lawyers works to ensure that personal information in its possession is accurate, current and complete. If you think that                     the personal information Best Lawyers holds on you is incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete or outdated, you may request the revision or correction of that information. If it is determined that                     personal information is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated, we will revise it.
Withdrawal of Consent — If you have provided consent for the processing of your data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time which will not affect the                     lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn.
Objection to Processing — You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data including profiling, on grounds relating to your particular situation as                     provided by Data Protection law. When profiling is related to direct marketing you always have a right to object to the profiling.
Limitation to Processing — You have the right to obtain from us restriction of processing in certain instances as provided by data protection law.
Right to Data Portability — You have the right to receive the personal data, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format                     when the processing is based on your consent or on a contract. You also have the right to ask us to transmit it to another data controller of your choice.
Complaints — You have the right to lodge a complaint to the Data Protection Authority in the country where you live or work, if you believe that Best Lawyers has not                     complied with the requirements of the GDPR with regard to your personal data.
If you wish to exercise one of your rights, please send a request in this regard via email to info@bestlawyers.com .
6.2 How long will your personal data be retained?
We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as doing so serves the purposes for which the information was initially collected as stated in this privacy                 policy, or as subsequently authorized. We may continue processing your personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the                 purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research and statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of this Privacy Policy. When we                 have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information                 has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be                 resolved between Best Lawyers and an individual.

If applicable, this                 information would include the categories of personal information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior                 calendar year. To obtain this information please write to us at: Privacy Matters, c/o Best Lawyers, 237 Park Avenue SW, Suite 101, Aiken, SC 29801, USA.
