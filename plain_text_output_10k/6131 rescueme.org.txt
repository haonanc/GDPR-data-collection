We may change this privacy policy periodically by updating this page. Please check this web page from time to time for changes. Your use of this site following the posting of changes to this policy will mean you accept those changes.
WO does not collect any personal information about users, except that which is knowingly and specifically supplied to us by the user.
WO is committed to ensuring the privacy of your personal information.
WO will not sell or pass on your information to any other organization outside of WO unless you specifically and expressly give us permission to do so.
If you are under 18 years old, WO suggests that you ask your parents or guardian before signing up on this site.
What information do we collect?
a) Personal information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and date of birth (where appropriate). We collect this information only in connection with specific activities, such as membership, campaigns, feedback, surveys, email newsletter subscriptions, etc. You don't have to disclose any of this information if you do not wish to.
b) Non-personal information such as IP address (the location of the computer on the internet), pages accessed and files downloaded. This helps us to determine how many individuals use our site, how many people visit on a regular basis, which pages are most popular, and which pages are least popular. This information doesn't tell us anything about who you are, it simply allows us to monitor and improve our service.
Personal information submitted through the forms on this site is held only in a WO database. We promise that WO will not share the information you give to us on this website with any other organization outside of WO unless you have specifically given us permission to do so.
If you are under 18, be sure to obtain your parent's or guardian's permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the internet. We encourage parents to get involved with their children's use of the internet and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating.
