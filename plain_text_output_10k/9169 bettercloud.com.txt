Effective Date: May 24, 2018 This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of BetterCloud, Inc. (“BetterCloud”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and explains how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information in connection with our websites and mobile apps (collectively, the “Sites”), and the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information. Please see the Product Privacy Statement to understand how customer personal data is collected, used and protected by the BetterCloud platform, applications and services separately from the Sites. Individuals located in the European Union should be sure to read the important information provided here.
We collect personal information about you in the following ways:
Information you give us. Personal information you may provide through the Site or otherwise communicate to us when you:
register for an account on the Sites, such as a username and preferences;
complete forms or request information through the Sites, such as your name, employer, postal address, and email address;
contact us to report a problem with our Sites, contact customer support or otherwise correspond with us by phone, email, or other means.
Information from Social Networking Sites. Our Sites include interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each a “SNS”). If you connect to a SNS through our Sites you authorise us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.
Information we get from others. We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, we may get your name and email address through the “tell a friend” referral section of our website. We may add this to information we get from our Sites.
Information automatically collected. We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Sites. For example, we may log your computer or mobile device IP address, geographic location (should you choose to provide it), operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing to our Sites, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Sites. We collect this information about you using cookies. Please refer to the Cookies and Similar Technologies section for more details.
Changes to Your Personal Information
It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please let us know if your personal information changes during your relationship with us by updating your registration profile or emailing us at privacy@bettercloud.com .
Cookies and Similar Technologies
What are cookies?
We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Sites; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
Cookies we use
Our Sites use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:
Type of cookie
Essential Cookies
These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Sites and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
Functionality Cookies
These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make when you use our Sites. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Sites.
Analytics and Performance Cookies
These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use our Sites. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Sites, the websites that referred them to our Sites, the pages they visited on our Sites, what time of day they visited our Sites, whether they have visited our Sites before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Sites.
Social Media Cookies
These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Sites or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter. The social network will record that you have done this.
Targeted and advertising cookies
These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show advertisements which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites. You can disable certain cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting this site or, in the EU, this site . If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioural advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.
Disabling cookies
You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org .
If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Sites. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.
Local Storage Objects
We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store Your user information and settings. Third parties with whom We partner to provide certain features on Our site or to display advertising based upon Your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
Pixel tags
We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users on our Sites. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users’ personal data.
Framing
Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Sites. Please be aware that you are providing your information to these third parties and not to us.
