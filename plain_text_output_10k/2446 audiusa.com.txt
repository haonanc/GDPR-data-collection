Audi vehicles may be equipped with Audi connect CARE, which does not require any action from you to activate and is automatically enabled and active before purchase or lease. Audi connect CARE cannot be disabled in equipped vehicles, without significantly impacting the impacting the user experience and function of the infotainment system. This plan includes some or all of the following services:
Automatic and manual Audi emergency call (in the event of an airbag deployment or if you contact us directly through the ‘SOS’ button to notify us of an emergency, an emergency service center, contracted by AoA, will respond);
Stolen vehicle locator (at your request, we will attempt to locate your stolen vehicle in coordination with law enforcement authorities); and
Online roadside assistance (non-emergency roadside assistance when requested, including through use of the “wrench” button).

The Connect CARE plan requires the collection and use of information from you (which may include a phone call to discuss the situation and assistance needed, which is recorded and monitored) and your vehicle (including your vehicle’s GPS location and other vehicle data that will help us get emergency responders to you or help us dispatch appropriate service providers). GPS location data that is collected for the purpose of providing Connect CARE services is only available and used by us upon our receipt of an automatic notification from your vehicle, when the SOS button is pushed or when you request other online roadside services through the “wrench” button.
Although Connect CARE is automatically activated in equipped vehicles, to utilize the Audi Service Request and Remote Lock/Unlock functions of Connect CARE, you must register a “key user.”  The data collection practices around key user registration and Audi Service Request functionality are discussed in separate sections below.
We may use your information in a number of ways, including:

In an anonymous or aggregated format.  We may also use or share your information in an anonymized or aggregate manner for any purpose.
We also share your information with emergency responders and service providers (such as police, ambulance providers, and towing providers) and law enforcement for purposes of offering Connect CARE.
We also share information with your vehicle’s satellite radio and/or wireless service provider, if applicable, to enable those service providers to contact you with important information about your vehicle’s satellite or wireless services and for their own marketing purposes.
With your express permission, we also will share your information with selected third parties you choose, to enable services that use your information but are not provided directly by AoA. These services could include, but are not limited to, remote package and fuel delivery, or usage-based insurance or tolling pricing, or other mobility-based services.
In addition, we may share your information with third parties, law enforcement or other government agencies to comply with law or legal requirements; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; and to protect our rights and the property or safety of our users or third-parties. We also may disclose information about you and your vehicle when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the websites or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

We also share your information with other carefully selected companies with whom we may partner to provide you with information about products or services we think may be of interest to you. 
We may also use or share your information in an anonymized or aggregate manner.
Most Audi vehicles are equipped with technology that tracks, and shares with AoA, information about the vehicle as described above, including numerous data points about the vehicle’s usage, performance, safety, status, and GPS location.  AoA uses and shares this information for the purposes described above.
Your vehicle may be equipped with a “Privacy Mode” that allows you to control what information is collected from the vehicle, including the ability to discontinue any sharing of vehicle data except for emergency call purposes. Please see the “Audi Connect” or “Data Privacy” sections of the owner’s manual for your vehicle to determine if your vehicle has Privacy Mode. You may also find a list of vehicle models equipped with privacy mode here .  Please note that disabling the data sharing capabilities will inhibit AoA’s ability to provide you with Audi connect services and other functionalities. Please see your owner’s manual for a description of what services will be disrupted and what will still be available when privacy mode is enabled. Vehicle models that offer limited connected services from third parties only (such as online traffic and infotainment), but not any remote services from Audi (TT, R8, A3, and Q3 models) are not equipped with Privacy Mode because Audi does not collect data from such vehicles.

In addition to information we obtain from Audi Dealers and connected services that you may choose to use, we also may obtain information about you and your vehicle from AoA-authorized sellers of consumer merchandise, Audi Financial Services (“AFS”), an operating unit of Volkswagen Credit, Inc., (if you finance your AoA vehicle purchase or purchase products from AFS) and other sources such as companies that provide or sell lists of potential vehicle purchasers and current owners.  We may combine information that we receive from the various sources described in this Privacy Statement, including third-party sources, with personal information and use it for the purposes identified below.

vehicle purchase or lease information (such as VIN, make, model, year, dealer, date of purchase or lease, purchase/lease price, vehicle equipment, and service history)
vehicle data (such as general status data--warning lights, upcoming service schedule, fuel level, battery level, tire pressure, service history and fault or trouble codes; ambient data -- outside temperature and brightness; vehicle performance data; and other data about your vehicle including its identification, condition, equipment status, or collision information)

If your vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Recorder (“EDR”) crash or near-crash information about the vehicle or driver’s behavior will be recorded in the vehicle.  EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs, not under normal driving conditions.
For information about your vehicle’s EDR data or other crash or near crash information collected and how we might receive and use it, please see your owner’s manual.
Audi vehicles may be equipped with Audi Connect CARE which does not require any action from you to activate and is automatically enabled and active before purchase or lease. Audi connect CARE cannot be disabled in equipped vehicles. This plan includes:
automatic and manual Audi emergency call (in the event of an airbag deployment or if you contact us directly through the ‘SOS’ button to notify us of an emergency, an emergency service center, contracted by AoA, will respond);
stolen vehicle locator (at your request, we will attempt to locate your stolen vehicle in coordination with law enforcement authorities); and
online roadside assistance (non-emergency roadside assistance when requested, including through use of the “wrench” button).
The Connect CARE plan requires the collection and use of information from you (which may include a phone call to discuss the situation and assistance needed, which is recorded and monitored) and your vehicle (including your vehicle’s GPS location and other vehicle data that will help us get emergency responders to you or help us dispatch appropriate service providers). GPS location data collected for the purpose of providing Connect CARE services is only available and used by us upon our receipt of an automatic notification from your vehicle, when the SOS button is pushed or when you request other online roadside services through the “wrench” button.
Although Connect CARE is automatically activated in equipped vehicles, to utilize the Audi Service Request function of Connect CARE, you must register a “key user.”  The data collection practices around key user registration and Audi Service Request functionality are discussed in separate sections below.
