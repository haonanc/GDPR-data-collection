Payment information is encrypted, transferred and stored as a token at a third-party processor to ensure the security of data. Payment tokens may be provided to a Partner Course in the event that the Partner Course is required to charge you in accordance with their no-show policy. By providing payment information and completing the transaction, you consent to the use of this payment information by EZLinks and third-parties for the sole purpose of facilitating transactions (eg: purchases, refunds) and to support the facilitation of EZLinks Terms and Conditions and Sales Policies including applicable Partner Course policies including but not limited to the facilitation of No Show charges.
Records of your contact with us: In addition to Account and Payment information, we also maintain certain information about your usage of the EZLinks Platforms, your contact with us, and your ordering history. This information is maintained to better serve your individual needs, to facilitate a smoother search and transaction process, to audit and investigate site use, and to help us better deliver an experience catered to your needs.

Information You Provide: The EZLinks Platforms may provide features through which you can publicly post content (comments, reviews, golf scores, messages, images, videos, text or other material). Note that anything you post publicly or submit directly may be viewed by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose personal information or other information publicly, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply. Additionally, we will maintain information that you voluntarily provide to us, whether as part of publicly posted content or not. Some of this information may have to do with your golfing behavior and preferences and will be maintained by us to provide you with a better experience and more pertinent offers. Such information could include: reviews of golf courses you have played; scoring; courses played; preferred brands of clubs and golf balls, etc.
Information from other Users: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, someone may provide information about you in order to reserve a golf tee time on your behalf or to send you information or a gift card through the EZLinks Platforms. We may combine this information in our database and we may use it to contact you about a reserved tee time or other product purchased for you, or to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. Third parties also may forward your information to us; for example, if you are using a service that uses the EZLinks Platforms or an EZLinks application program interface (API) to present available golf tee times. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the EZLinks Platforms, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

Information may also be shared with third-party marketing partners and services to support EZLinks and third-party marketing efforts and analysis.
Fulfillment of Transaction (Partner Course)
In the event you conduct a transaction through the EZLinks Platforms, we will share your information with the facility or third party that will fulfill your purchase (usually, a golf course). The primary piece of information used to identify you when you purchase a round of golf will be your email address, which will be shared with the golf course. Your use of the EZLinks Platforms confirms your consent for EZLinks and the Partner Course to use your email address for future golf marketing initiatives.

Similarly, if you interact with us through a third-party site, we may have access to information about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third-party site).

We may share the personal information we collect through the EZLinks Platforms with our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our vendors and partners, including marketing alliance partners and the golf courses at which you - or a friend on your behalf - reserve tee times using the EZLinks Platforms. In addition, we also may share the information described above in connection with a business transfer, such as to another company that may purchase all or substantially all of the assets we use to provide the EZLinks Platforms to you (this includes disclosure during the due diligence process). We may share both personal and non-personal Information for legal reasons, such as in response to a subpoena or when required by law, to defend our rights or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual, or in response to a written request from law enforcement regarding an investigation into criminal activity that may have occurred through or in any way using the EZLinks Platforms.
