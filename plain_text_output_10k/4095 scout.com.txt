What Information does SiteScout collect, and how does it use it?
Registration
In order to use the Services, you must first complete the registration form, and choose a password. During registration, you must provide contact information, such as your name, phone number, company name and website. We use this information to create your account, and to contact you in regards to the Services.
Orders
If you wish to fund your account, you must provide your address and financial information (e.g. credit card number; expiry date; etc). We use this information for billing purposes, and to process your order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use the information we collected to contact you.
Surveys or Contests
From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and to process and analyze survey results.
We use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; that company is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
Other Sources
We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our Services. This may include which of our pages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses.
We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
If you arrive at our website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.
We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as web beacons ) to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics, but not personally identifiable information.
Uses of Information
In addition to the above-noted reasons, we use the information we collect to provide you with the Services. This includes providing you with customer support, which requires us to access your information to assist you (such as with campaign creation or technical troubleshooting).
We also use your information for the following purposes:
To monitor and improve our services and features. We internally perform statistical and other analysis on information we collect (including usage data, device data, referral data, and information from page tags) to analyze and measure user behavior and trends, to understand how people use our services, and to monitor, troubleshoot and improve our Services.
To assist the enforcement of our Terms of Service.
To prevent potentially illegal activities.
To screen for undesirable or abusive activity.
To create new services, features or content. We may use any information you provide us (e.g. via email or through our ticketing system) to create and provide new services, features or content. For example, we may publish interesting observations from the surveys for informational or marketing purposes. When we do this, we will not personally identify you, unless we first receive your permission.
To contact you about your service or account. We occasionally send you communications of a transactional nature (e.g. service-related announcements, billing-related matters, changes to our services or policies, welcome emails when you first register, etc). You can’t opt out of these communications, since they are necessary in order for us to effectively provide our services to you.
To contact you for marketing purposes (if you opt-in on our registration page). We will only do this if you have given us your express permission to contact you for this purpose.
To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password, as well as a number of on-boarding emails intended to familiarize you with SiteScout.
