HOW DOES UCHEALTH USE YOUR INFORMATION?
UCHealth may use your Personal Information to help facilitate transactions into which you enter, including answering your questions, which may be shared with UCHealth staff who are most able to address your concerns. UCHealth will archive your messages once we have made our best effort to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response. UCHealth uses a third-party vendor to help it manage some authorized email and text communications with you. While UCHealth does supply these vendors with email addresses of those individuals we wish to have them contact, they are not permitted to use your email address for any purpose other than to communicate with you on our behalf.
When you click on a link in an email, you may temporarily be redirected through one of the vendor’s servers (although this process will be invisible to you) which will register that you’ve clicked on that link, and have visited our website or utilized our mobile application.
When you provide your email address to UCHealth by registering for the Site or App, you agree to receive email communications directly from UCHealth about UCHealth products and services. Even if you have given UCHealth permission to send emails to you, you may revoke that permission at any time by following the “unsubscribe” information at the bottom of the email.
UCHealth may use Usage Information to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any), including by sending email or text messages to your wireless phone, tablet, or other mobile device (each a “Device”). You also grant UCHealth an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free right and license to use your Usage Information to enhance our products and services and to develop new products and services.
HOW DO WE USE PRECISE LOCATION INFORMATION?
UCHealth may use your precise geographical location information in order to provide you with information and otherwise provide services and functionality that you have requested. You may choose not to have your location disclosed when prompted upon accessing the UCHealth website or mobile application.
HOW DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?
UCHealth may disclose some of your registration information, such as your contact information, in order to complete a transaction initiated by you or without your authorization when necessary to provide for treatment, or in connection with payment or healthcare operations issues, as well as in emergency circumstances or when required to do so by law.
UCHealth does not disclose any of your information with third parties other than as follows: (i) to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law and our legal obligations, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process; (ii) when UCHealth believes in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect its rights, your safety or the safety of others, including persons with whom you have arranged meetings via the App; (iii) with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who work for us and need access to your information to do that work; (iv) to investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; (v) in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company. UCHealth does not access your contact information or address book within your Device. Nor does UCHealth have any access to any of the personal information or credit card information that you have provided to UCHealth in order to register for their services. You should be familiar with the privacy practices of UCHealth before providing such information.
UCHealth may also share aggregated or de-identified information for any reason and at any time.

WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY TRACKING OR ADVERTISING?
Sending email directly to an email address found on a UCHealth website is not secure. Unsecured information transferred over the Internet is similar to a postcard being sent through the mail. It is recommended that you do not send sensitive personal health information to UCHealth or anyone else using unsecured means. Should you choose to supply confidential information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.
UCHealth is not responsible for the content or privacy statements of those links or the content of any third-party websites or third party mobile applications. If you are asked to supply personal information to those websites or mobile applications, we suggest you read carefully through the privacy statements of those websites or mobile applications.
UCHealth may include information on the Site or App including social media features. These social media features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the social media feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the UCHealth website or mobile application. Your interactions with these social media features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing them.
UCHealth may use your information to re-target or re-market to you via advertisements on the Site or App. UCHealth partners with a third party ad network to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on the Site or App and to then provide you with UCHealth advertising on other websites. We may also place a persistent third-party cookie (provided by Google) on your hard drive if you sign on to uchealth.org. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by utilizing the Google opt-out tool. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic non-targeted ads featuring UCHealth.
WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN?
UCHealth’s websites and mobile application are intended for adults and young adults age 13 and over, and they are not intended for persons under the age of 13. Any child under the age of 13 should not register to use any portion of the UCHealth website and/or mobile application, or provide any personally identifiable information. It is not UCHealth’s desire or intent through its website and/or mobile application to collect and store any personally identifiable information from any person UCHealth actually knows to be under the age of 13. If UCHealth is made aware of collecting information of a child under the age of 13, UCHealth will delete this information.
WHAT ARE YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS?
