Notice to California Customers – Your California Privacy Rights
California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As discussed above above, if You wish to opt-out of our sharing of Your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes or to find out more about Your opt-out rights, please contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below.
