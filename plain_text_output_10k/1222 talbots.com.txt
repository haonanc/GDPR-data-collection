What are My Choices About Behavioral Advertising?
Like many retailers, Talbots contracts with third-parties to serve or send advertisements on our behalf. Advertising companies will typically collect anonymous information about a user's browsing activity, including the websites visited and the products viewed, and will then use that information to serve or send targeted advertisements. These targeted advertisements such as campaigns through Google AdWords including remarketing, interesting category marketing, similar audience campaigns, interest-based advertising, and demographic and location targeting. Some customers prefer not to receive this type of advertising.
Some websites have "do not track" features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals. However, many of Talbots marketing partners are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, or the Digital Advertising Alliance, and have agreed to honor consumers' opt-out preferences submitted through those organizations' websites.
