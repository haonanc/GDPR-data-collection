You may, however, disallow receiving cookies at any time through your web browser. Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookie, certain of the functions and conveniences of our Site may not work properly but you do not have to accept our cookie in order to productively use our Site. We may also collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server and to otherwise administer our Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. This information does not contain any Personally Identifiable Information about you. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.   An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically when you use the Internet. SMG logs your IP address when you use the Site or other Service. SMG uses your IP address to track your use of the Site or other Service. Pixels. Pixels, also called clear GIFs, are invisible files on Web pages that you visit.

However, Aggregate Information does not include any of your Personally Identifiable Information.  Selling and Renting Information.

SMG may also share with those same third parties certain limited personal information that, without other information, does not specifically identify you. Sharing with Social Networks or Other Sites You May Authorize. If you are a member of a social network service (such as Facebook, MySpace, etc.) or you use other Internet sites where you have authorized them to gather information about your online behavior on SMG (for instance, to notify your friends that you have viewed a video or bought movie tickets), including participation in any behavioral reporting program that they may operate on or off of their own site (i.e., Facebook Beacon, etc.), SMG may share information regarding your activities on our Site or other Service with those third parties pursuant to your authorization, and they may associate that information with Personally Identifiable Information they already have about you (such as your Facebook Profile) and use it to improve their site or services or for other purposes. SMG does not control the privacy policies of such third parties, and their privacy policies will govern their use of your information once it has been transmitted by SMG. SMG assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third parties that you authorize to gather information from SMG. Other Sharing.  SMG may also share cookies and pixels with trusted service providers or other third parties to customize your experience on the Site or other service or to provide you with more relevant information or otherwise improve your experience on other web sites, but those third parties will not contact you directly. SMG may transfer the Personally Identifiable Information it collects to successors in interest to SMG, such as a company that acquires SMG.
