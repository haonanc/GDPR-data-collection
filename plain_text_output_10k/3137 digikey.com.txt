Cookies – The Web Site may use "cookies" to provide information on your computer. Cookies are pieces of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer or device. Digi-Key may use both session and persistent cookies on our own or through our third-party service providers as described below. Cookies may save your preferences while you are at the Web Site, such as allowing for persistent login on pages that require logging in, and Digi-Key may use them to provide you with tailored information and tracking as you use the Web Site services.

By modifying your browser preferences, you may have the choice to accept cookies, to be notified when a cookie is sent, or to reject cookies. The rejection or limitation of cookies by your browser may limit your ability to use the Web Site.
Cookies we use fall into the categories below and usually have specific purposes of use:
Cookie Category
Strictly Necessary
These are general purpose platform session cookies, used to maintain an anonymous user session by the server.
Performance Based
These cookies are used for web analytics to identify repeat visits by unique users, sometimes by assigning a randomly generated number as a client identifier. These cookies can also identify session and campaign data for analytics reports. By default, these cookies are set to expire after 2 years, although this is customizable by website owners.
Functionality
These cookies are used to stored the visitor's geolocation, to record location and update a page share count, and track how often a user interacts with a web widget. These cookies can also identify unique identifiers for each page and test whether or not a browser is set to accept first party cookies.
Targeting
These cookies are used for advertising, audience targeting, and provide a data management platform which enables cookies to capture real time profiling of visitor interests.
Unknown
These cookies help manage availability and performance of software applications and the impact on user experience in the form of deep transaction tracing, synthetic monitoring, real user monitoring, and network monitoring. These cookies are also associated with managing sessions on load balanced servers, to ensure user requests are routed consistently to the correct server, usually the one that it is hosted on, but not always. These unknown cookies do not always have names or descriptions. They can change for each page on the site and different users will have different cookies. Different countries have different tags as well.
Third-Party Service Providers – Digi-Key may use a variety of third-party services to help provide our services, to help us understand the use of our services, provide information and provide advertising regarding the Web Site and our products and services.

Google Analytics and Facebook –
Digi-Key may use services through companies such as Google and Facebook to target ads to you related to your usage of the Web Site, such as to display advertising for the Web Site, products, and services on other websites you visit based on your activities on the Web Site in the past. Google may use the data collected to track and examine the use of the Web Site, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may also use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
Google Analytics uses "cookies" - text files that are saved on your computer and that enable the analysis of your use of the Web Site. The information generated by the cookie about your usage of this Web Site is generally transmitted to a Google server in the United States and saved there. Due to the activation of IP anonymization on these Web pages, however, your IP address will be truncated by Google beforehand within the member states of the European Union and other signatory states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be passed to a Google server in the United States and truncated there. On behalf of the operator of this Website, Google will use this information to evaluate your usage of the Website, to compile reports about Website activities, and to render further services for the Website operator in relation to Website and Internet usage. The IP address transmitted by your browser for the purposes of Google Analytics will not be associated with other Google data.
Digi-Key utilizes the User-ID feature of Google Analytics, which allows us to track individual users across multiple devices and sessions using the Web Site. You may view Google’s privacy policy here: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en ,with more information located here: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ (including information regarding how to control how information is shared through your Ads Settings) and here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en .
The Web Site may use Google conversion tracking. If you reach our Web Site via an ad controlled by Google, Google AdWords places a cookie on your computer. The cookie is used for conversion tracking if a user clicks on an ad controlled by Google. If the user visits certain pages on our Web Site and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google are able to detect that the user in question clicked the ad and was forwarded to the relevant page. The information collected using the conversion cookie enables the creation of conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have chosen to use conversion tracking. The customers are told the total number of users who clicked their ad and were forwarded to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information using this system that can be used to personally identify users.
If you do not wish to take part in tracking, you can decline the setting of the relevant cookie by means of a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. Please note that you must not delete the corresponding opt-out cookies if you wish to continue preventing measurement data from being recorded. If you delete all of the cookies in your browser, you must set any required opt-out cookies again.
You can prevent the collection of the data generated by Google Analytics in relation to your use of the Web site (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in, with more information regarding how you can opt out of Google Analytics data collection as instructed here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout . This link provides instructions for installing an opt-out cookie on your device. As a result, the collection of data by Google Analytics is prevented in future for this Web Site and for this browser as long as the opt-out cookie remains installed in your browser.
Facebook similarly provides more information regarding the information it collects and how it is used in relation to advertising along with methods to opt out of collecting and sharing of information here: https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads ; and https://www.facebook.com/policy.php .
Additional general information regarding opt-out from interest-based advertising from companies belonging to the Network Advertising Initiative can be found here: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ , information regarding opting out through the Digital Advertising Alliance can be found here: http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/ , and information regarding opting out through the European Digital Advertising Alliance (“EDAA”) may also be found here: http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and here: https://www.edaa.eu/ .
Web Beacons - We may employ Web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs), which are customized links or similar technologies, on the Web Site and when sending you messages, newsletters, or promotional emails or in using third-party service providers. Web beacons allow us to (a) determine whether you have opened, or acted upon, a promotional email and which links you have clicked on to deliver to you more focused communications and other content, (b) allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain webpages and effectively deliver services, and (c) enable us to compile aggregated statistics and determine the efficacy of promotions by using Web beacons from third parties.

Digi-Key has access to LivePerson's recorded and stored chat information and may monitor or review such information for quality assurance. Digi-Key may also use that information in accordance with Digi-Key's Privacy Statement and Web Site Terms & Conditions.
