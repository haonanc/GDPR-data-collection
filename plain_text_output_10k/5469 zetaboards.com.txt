What information does ZetaBoards gather:
When you register as a member on a board hosted by ZetaBoards you need  to provide an email address, select a username, and enter a password. The  username you choose does not have to be your real name. Your chosen password  is protected by an un-reversible hash. The email address you provide can be used to allow members  to contact you, for ZetaBoards to send important notices to you, or for certain feature of the board you visit to work.  You may choose to disable features that can send you emails. ZetaBoards  also collects other information such as IP addresses and the  date and time of your visit. Administrators of each board do have the  ability to view your IP address if you post messages, visit, or register on their board.
How we use gathered information:
The email address you provide is used by us to validate your board/account  registration. We may also send important notices or warnings via email.  ZetaBoards will never sell or spam your email address. Any survey you  fill out is used to provide better ads or improve our services. No information  provided through a survey is linked to you as an individual. All other  information you provide is either optional or will enhance a board's features.  ZetaBoards reserves the right to disclose any information if we believe  that a law has been violated. ZetaBoards may transfer the information  in our possession if ZetaBoards is sold or merges. We may disclose general  statistics to our sponsors and advertisers. No personal information will  be given to third parties. Your email address will never be given to an  advertiser.
How we protect your information:
We have strict policies against spam mail being sent to you from an ZetaBoards  free board. Many features are in place to prevent spam from being  sent. In addition if any member or board is caught sending spam their  account will be deleted. All passwords stored are encrypted and can never  be seen. We have taken many steps towards securing your information.
