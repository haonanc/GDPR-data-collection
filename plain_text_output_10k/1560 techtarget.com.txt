2. Analytical, Behavioral, Log, and Clickstream Data. We may gather certain information about your use of the Websites, such as your browser type and information about your visit and interaction with our Content.
One of the ways in which we collect this information is through Tracking Technologies such as cookies and web beacons. A cookie is a small file downloaded on to a device when a user accesses certain websites. Cookies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and provide you with a high level of service and relevant offers. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. For more information about our use of cookies and other Tracking Technologies, please visit our Cookie Policy .
We partner with certain Service Providers to collect analytical, behavioral, log, and clickstream data and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting. We, our Service Providers, and our Sponsors may use Tracking Technologies to identify you when you are online, and to collect information about your online activities, such as the type of browser you use, the websites you visit, your IP address, geographic location, browser type and version, and the content and advertising that you find interesting.

Although Our Websites currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed in the section entitled “Opting Out and Your Personal Rights.” If you do not wish to have Tracking Technologies be used when interacting with the Websites, many web browsers allow you to stop accepting cookies and/or to warn you when a third party is trying to transfer a cookie to you. Please note that some TechTarget features and services may not be available to you if Tracking Technologies are disabled.
