Current Online Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how Current may collect, use and disclose information we obtain through the Current Service.
The “Current Service” means any websites, mobile applications, and other services under the control of Current, in connection with providing an online or digital platform for Current's services, including the provision of a digital platform on which customers can convert personal funds into digital vouchers redeemable at third party providers of goods and services.
“Personal Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.
