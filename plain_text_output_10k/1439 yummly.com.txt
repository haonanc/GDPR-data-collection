Yummly Privacy Policy (as available online 081717)
Yummly provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Yummly services, including the Yummly website (the Site) and Yummly mobile application (the App) (collectively, the Services). This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site or in the App. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our  Terms of Service .
As used in this policy, the terms using and processing information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.
Information Collection and Use
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Services. To provide you with a consistent user experience and to recognize you as a user across the Services, we may collect and combine data as described below across the Services; for example, data collected when you visit the Site or the App from one browser or device may be combined or linked with data collected through your use of the App, or with data collected when you visit the Site or App from a different browser or device.
Personally Identifiable Information In the course of using the Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you (Personal Information). If you create an Account using your login from a Social Network, we will access and collect the information about you that your privacy settings on that Social Network permits us to access so that we can create an Account for you. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide our Services and administer your inquiries. For example, when you create an account through the Services and become a Registered User or when you choose to create your own profile webpage, we may ask you for Personal Information.
We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Yummly newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your user preferences information.
Registered Users Once you become a Registered User, you will be able to create a profile page by submitting certain Personal Information. The profile page will display your screen name as well as your profile picture, if you choose to upload one. You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile. Providing such information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with other Yummly users. We will also collect the contact information of your friends, if you choose to connect your contacts and address book information with your Account, so that you can connect with your friends when you use our Services.
Non-Identifying Information. We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile page (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences based on your activity on the Site and in the App, such as viewing and/or food preferences) (Non-Identifying Information). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non- Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).
We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver information to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
Application Usage Information When you use the App, our servers will automatically record information that your mobile device sends or transmits, including, but not limited to, the model and device ID number of your mobile device, user settings, location (if you enable this feature) and information about your use of the App (App Usage Information). We use this information to provide and improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you.
Log Data When you visit or use the Services, use a Yummly web-based application or a site that has Yummly features (like the Yum button), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (Log Data). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site or the App that you visit (or of the site you visited that had the Yummly feature), the time spent on those pages, information you search for, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for technical administration, to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our visitors' needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Site or the App again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding Non-Identifying Information.
Cookies Like many websites, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons and similar technologies to collect Log Data and other information. Pixels and web beacons are small pieces of code placed on web pages and content that communicate when the page or content has been viewed. A cookie is a small data file that your browser places on your computer that helps us understand how you interact with the Site and use our Services. We use two types of cookies. We use persistent cookies to save information like your search preferences, your Account settings and login information, so that we can remember you and your settings when you return to the Site or App, and personalize your experience. We use session cookies to enable certain features of or our Services, but unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you leave or log off and/or when you close your browser. Third-party advertisers on the Site or in the App may also place or read cookies on your browser. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies but you can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of or all functionality of the Services.
We may also use third parties to collect usage analytics for our Services. These third parties will place their own cookies to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver us relevant metrics and information. We do not share any personal information of our users with these parties, but we may share anonymized or aggregated information with them to help improve our Services. The collection of this data by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policy. For more information visit:  Google Analytics  and  Mixpanel .
Interest-Based Advertising / Your Choices
As described above, we and other parties we do business with (including advertisers on the Site), may place or recognize unique cookies or other technologies on your browser or device when you visit the Site or use the App. In addition to the uses above, these technologies enable the collection of information about online activities over time and across different websites and apps, which can be used to customize advertisements to you as you browse the Internet. We follow the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, which enable consumers to opt-out of having online behavior collected and used for advertising purposes. To learn more about interest-based advertising, or to opt out for your web browser, please visit optout.aboutads.info or optout.networkadvertising.org ; to opt out for mobile apps, please visit aboutads.info/appchoices . You may also be able to configure your mobile device privacy or advertising settings to limit the collection or use of data for advertising.
Do Not Track Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "do not track" setting. Because these features are not yet uniform, our systems are not configured to take action in response to these signals.

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Yummly transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
