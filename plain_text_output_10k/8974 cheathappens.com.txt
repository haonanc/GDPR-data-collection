CHEAT HAPPENS APPLICATIONS:
Cheat Happens Personalized Trainers
In an effort to maintain the integrity of the files downloaded from our site and to prevent illegal file sharing, our personalized trainers will perform an authenticity check while in use. This check requires an internet connection and the trainer will not run if a connection is absent or if the trainer is blocked by a security application. The only information sent to Cheat Happens during this process is a uniquely generated string that can only be used to identify the member for which the trainer was personalized. This information is useless outside of the Cheat Happens website as it does not correlate to any personally identifiable information. As a part of routine website logging, the originating IP address may also be collected. This check is only performed on trainers that have been personalized for individual use, not our PROMO or FREE trainers. If you want/need to use the trainer offline, please go to our trainer troubleshooting page for instructions on how to obtain an offline key to avoid online checks. Some trainers may collect and show debug information which may contain some personally identifiable information in plain text. This information is not automatically sent to the Cheat Happens website. It is up to the end user to submit this information in order to help with troubleshooting trainer functionality. Some trainers may also feature a report function allowing users to send feedback to Cheat Happens. This feature may contain email address or other personally identifiable information but is optional.
Cheat Happens Offline Key Tool
This tool may be downloaded from our trainer troubleshooting page in order to generate an offline key that can be used to authenticate personalized trainers in an offline situation. This tool collects hardware specific information about the user's computer which is then used to generate a unique string of characters that correlates to a Cheat Happens user account. No personally identifiable information is included in the data obtain or sent back to Cheat Happens by this tool.
Cheat Happens Trainer Manager
This tool consists of two parts. One is a built-in web browser in which everything listed above under "CHEAT HAPPENS WEBSITE" applies. The second part is a compilation of personalized trainers located on the user's computer. If selected by the user, the application can check for new versions of trainers as well as the trainer manager application by making a simple request to the Cheat Happens website containing only information about the trainer and/or application, not the user. As a part of routine website logging, the originating IP address may be collected.
Cheat Happens CoSMOS
This tool performs a routine check to see if a new version is available. No personal information is sent during this process. As a part of routine website logging, the originating IP address may be collected. A feedback as well as crash log routine is included in which users may choose to send this data to Cheat Happens. This may contain email address or other personally identifiable information but is optional.
