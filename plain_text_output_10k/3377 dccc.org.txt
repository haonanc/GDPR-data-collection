What Information Do We Collect?
Active Collection: We collect certain information you directly provide to us, such as when you request information, make a donation, sign a petition, make a purchase, send us an email or sign up to receive updates, fill out a form, connect through a social feed, sign up to be a volunteer or host an event, submit a resume, or create an account or profile.  We also collect any information you provide when you post comments or other content or participate in interactive features, surveys, contests, games, or promotions. The types of information we collect may include your name, password, email address, address, phone numbers, credit card number and other information you choose to provide.  We may supplement the information you provide with information we obtain from other sources. For example, we may obtain publicly-available information from voter rolls or partner with other companies to obtain demographic or other data about people who may be interested in our organization.
In addition, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) may require us to collect personal information from donors.  For example, the FEC requires us to collect (and disclose) the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of all individuals whose donations exceed $200 per calendar year.

Such information includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system and browser type, the unique ID number associated with your mobile device, the address of a referring web site, and your activity on our Services.

We may use third-party analytics services to help us analyze how users use our Services.  These analytics services may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies when you use our Services.  The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use, links clicked, the time spent on Web pages or applications, and advertisements viewed.
We also work with third-party advertising companies that may use cookies or other technologies to serve ads on other websites based on your visits to our websites and other websites.
