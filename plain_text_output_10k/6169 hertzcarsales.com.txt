Many of Our Cars are Still Under Factory Warranty
Every Hertz vehicle comes with a limited powertrain warranty for 12 months/12,000 miles, whichever comes first. That’s because most of them are still 25,000 to 40,000 miles young, with their best years ahead of them. Warranties vary from car to car, but we think you’ll be impressed. And of course, optional protection plans are also available.
Extend Your Warranty with a Protection Plan
For many, a car is the second largest purchase and the comfort in knowing that you won’t be stuck with debilitating repairs is important. Many of our vehicles are still under factory warranty, but it’s always smart to make sure you have a level of coverage that you’re comfortable with. For our customers who want the extra protection, we offer a variety of protection plans for every budget.

Find Used Cars
Welcome to Hertz Car Sales - Your Best Bet for Used Rental Cars at a Price You Can Afford
When it comes to finding an incredible deal on a used vehicle, Hertz Car Sales is your best option in your community. Bringing a local feel to your hometown or the metro center nearby, Hertz carries the same united philosophy all over the place: providing high-quality used vehicles for shoppers with all kinds of unique budget situations at prices that far better suit you for saving more. With a range of handy online resources, personalized customer service at our conveniently located stores and a set of benefits you won't find with other used car dealerships, Hertz is the place to be for your next vehicle purchase.
See What Makes the Hertz Used Rental Car Lineup so Special
Only the best vehicles make it to our inventory at Hertz so when you buy from us you know you're getting a high quality car, SUV or truck. We go through a rigorous process to make sure these used models are clean and in shape, ready to be driven back home. As you search through our lineup, you'll notice many are like-new pre-owned cars, coming from recent model years and featuring low mileage for a used vehicle. Even these lightly used vehicles that would normally command a premium price are often more affordable, which makes for smart buying when combined with the Hertz flexible financing options we offer.
You probably have your specific tastes, even when it comes to finding an affordable used car, and you'll find that Hertz has you covered. Featuring popular models from well-known brands like Chevy, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai and other automakers, our Hertz locations regularly have plenty of options. These well-known brands tend to make cars that are perfect for the used market a few years after their release, as they carry long-lasting durability and reliability, building trust for any pre-owned vehicle shopper. Sort through the selection that's available nearest to you, then find your way to the local Hertz store for a test drive.
Welcome to the Unique Shopping Experience Offered by Hertz
Of course our selection of affordable and high-quality used cars is the most compelling reason to shop with Hertz. You are, after all, looking for the best possible deal, and it all starts with the pricing and the kind of vehicle you're hoping to buy. But there's so much more Hertz does that our competitors - whether it's similar rental agencies that sell pre-owned models or brand-specific dealerships - can't offer. Sticking with the price of our used vehicles, you'll love the No-Haggle Pricing from Hertz. What you see is what you'll pay, and you'll shop confidently knowing we often price our used cars, trucks and SUVs considerably lower than what's estimated by leading industry sources like Kelley Blue Book (KBB).
If the price being set in stone seems odd for a used car purchase, you'll find the Hertz Flexible Financing gives you more options. We work with drivers of all different credit and financial situations to ensure the perfect used vehicle works for individual budgets. You'll do well to apply for financing with an online credit application, and from there we'll know what kind of used car loans you'll qualify for.
Peace of mind is crucial when it comes to shopping for a used car, and of course Hertz has you covered with the 12-month / 12,000-mile warranty that comes with your purchase. That will have you covered for a year - or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first - in case something unexpected occurs with your recently purchased used car.
Beyond the standard warranty offered with our Hertz used vehicles, you can add additional protection plans with your purchase. If that baseline warranty doesn't offer the coverage you want to be comfortable with your next used car purchase, these added protection plans can be included for affordable rates, granting you extra peace of mind.
