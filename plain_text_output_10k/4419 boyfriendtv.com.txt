Special category of data
Cams Boyfriendtv is an adult entertainment site and, due to the nature of our site and your          activity, we may have data about you, which could reflect your sexual interests.
When you create an account and freely indicate certain sexual preferences in order to          give yourself more visibility and presence on our site, you provide us with certain          information about your sexual life.
When you visit pages of Models on our site or when you watch live cam shows, we collect          the category of the Models you watched or whose page you visited in order to provide you          with the services you requested for and enhance your experience on the site. If you agreed          to receive promotional emails from us, we will also send you special offers and news about          our features based on your interests on our site.
Due to the explicit meaning of each category name, as well as the types of Models          (e.g. Asian girls, White Ladies, Latin Women, etc… from whom you request services),          it is possible that the chosen categories reflect your sexual orientation and give us          indications about your sexual life.
We understand that this may not explicitly reflect information about your life outside          of the site. It may only be a role you choose to play in the virtual environment.          However, in order to provide you with the highest level of data protection, we treat          this data as a special data category, which is highly protected.
What are your choices regarding the collection and use of this special category of data?
Because your sexual preferences and other data relating to your sexual life are essential          aspects of privacy, we are maintaining very high IT security standards. We are periodically          proceeding with controls and assessments of our security measures, in order to guarantee a trustworthy environment.
We will always ask you to agree to the use of this special category of data.
Please be aware that you can change your opinion regarding the global processing of          your sensitive data in your consent settings at any time.
However, please note that refusing to provide or revoking your consent to have this data          collected means that you will not be able to log into your account and use the services,          as we will not be able to provide you with the services without such information.
In case you freely indicated your sexual preferences in your account settings,          and you just want to delete this data, you can easily remove it from your profile in your account.          This will not affect your use of the site.
Why do we process your personal data?

With the Models
Your contract with us secures your ability to benefit from and purchase services relating to        adult entertainment from Models.
Regarding your profile information, by default, the only data element visible to the Model is your username. However, you may choose to share with a Model other information about you that you added to "My Profile" in your account settings, like your gender, age, location, interests, etc…; you may also connect your camera in private chat in order to visually communicate with the Model or just turn on your microphone. The Model is not allowed to record the visuals you provide. In any case, please keep in mind that you can manage the visibility of the information you added in "My Profile" by selecting the appropriate option in your privacy settings and therefore decide who can see the information you put on your profile.
What else do we show about you to the Models?
As the Models are appearing on several sites at the same time (all our sites and           affiliated sites), we show them from which site you are visiting from;
We show them a special icon, if you subscribed to their fan club;
We show them a special icon, if you added them in your favorites;
We show them a special icon, if you are a regular Member on a site and already           purchased a certain number of credits, so that they know that you deserve extra           attention and a good service. Please be aware that you can deactivate this           feature, by contacting us to the email address or address indicated in point "How to contact us?" .
With other users of the site and with the public
When you chat with a Model in a free chat, other users of our site can see your username         and the messages you write.
If you added information about yourself to "My Profile", you may choose to disclose such         information to other users, only to Models with whom you are in private chat or with no         one, in your privacy settings. As indicated, please keep in mind that you can manage the         visibility of the information you added in "My Profile" by selecting the appropriate option         in your privacy settings and therefore decide who can see the information you put on your profile.

Your comments and username may also be visible on the results of a search engine, like         Google, for example. Therefore, if you do not want other users or the public in general         to see your comments, please do not post comments on a Model’s wall.
When you initiate a private chat with a Model, only our organization and the Model can access        the communications and/or images (in case you turn on your webcam) you share.

In certain cases, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal information that you        have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or        request us to transmit this information to another service provider (where technically        feasible).

Such         information shall also be kept available in case of ongoing judicial proceedings/and or         investigations.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with         our legal obligations. For example, we may keep some of your information for tax, legal         reporting and auditing obligations. Please note that according to Luxembourg legislation         financial related information shall be kept for a period of ten years.
Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) may remain in our database, but are         disassociated from personal identifiers.
In order to protect our site and your personal information from accidental or malicious         loss and destruction, we have backup systems. Residual copies of your personal information         may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
Right to object
We process your data for a variety of reasons as explained in "Why do we process your personal data?" .          Applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes where such processing is based on legitimate interest.          If you object to such processing we will stop processing your personal data for these purposes.
In specific situations, we may have to refuse the execution of your request.         This would be the case where we have legitimate grounds to continue such processing or if we have to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
Please keep in mind that objecting to the use of your data might disable the use of your account.
Please note that you may, at any time, ask us to stop sending you marketing emails by         opting-out in your account settings.
Right to restriction of processing
You have the right to request that we hold your personal data in "limbo", while other challenges are resolved.
Basically, you can ask us to put on hold the use of your data in 4 cases:
If you contest the fact that the personal data we hold about you is accurate: in this         case, the processing operations in relation to this data will be put on hold for the period         during which this is verified.
You have objected to a processing activity based on legitimate interest(s): in this         case, you can require the processing operation to be put on hold while we verify the grounds         for processing.
You consider that the processing is unlawful but you object to erasure and request         restriction, instead.
We have no further need for the data but you require it to establish, exercise, or         defend legal claims.
Despite your request, we may still continue the processing of your personal data if we have        to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims. We will notify you before lifting a        restriction.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes the GDPR or any other        applicable national laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory        authority, (in particular in the Member State where you live, place of work or of an alleged        infringement of the GDPR).
Changes to our Privacy Policy
We may occasionally amend this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our services and the way we       handle your personal information or changes in the applicable laws.
If we make changes we consider important, we will let you know by placing a notice on the       relevant site and/or contact you using other methods such as email.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, such changes will be applicable from the time they are       published on our site, unless we specify a date of entry into force. Your continued use of our       site from that day on will be subject to the new Privacy Policy.
