Introduction
Daily Voice takes your right to privacy seriously, and we want you to feel comfortable using this web site. This privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as "data" below) that may be collected by this site. This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by Daily Voice, nor does it apply to persons that are not employees or agents of Daily Voice, or that are not under Daily Voice's control. Please take time to read this site's Terms of use .
Collection of data
Certain visitors to this website interact in ways that require Daily Voice to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Daily Voice gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, registration for an account on this site requires a valid e-mail address. Please be aware that the e-mail address you provide and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable, and may possibly be displayed on this web site intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). As on many web sites, Daily Voice may also automatically receive general information that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be served on this site is set forth below.
Use of data
Data may be used to customize and improve your user experience on this site, to allow us to better respond to your customer service inquiries, to administer contests, promotions, surveys or other site features, or to send you periodic emails or other communications. Efforts will be made to prevent your data being made available to third parties unless (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided on our site requires interaction with a third party, or is provided by a third party, such as an application service provider; (iv) pursuant to legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this site violates Daily Voice's policy, Terms of use, or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by Daily Voice to protect Daily Voice's legal rights and/or property; or (vi) this site is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able to use the data in the same manner as set forth in this policy. In the event you choose to use links displayed on this web site to visit other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies published on those sites. Note that aggregated and non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
Cookies

Advertisements may display on this web site and, if so, may set and access cookies on your computer; such cookies are subject to the privacy policy of the parties providing the advertisement. However, the parties providing the advertising do not have access to this site's cookies. These parties usually use non-personally-identifiable or anonymous codes to obtain information about your visits to this site. If you disable cookies in your browser, some features of the site experience may not function properly.
Third-party links
Occasionally, at Daily Voice's discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.

Google's use of cookies enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.

We have implemented the following:
