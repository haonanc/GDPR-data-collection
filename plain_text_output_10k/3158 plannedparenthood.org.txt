FULL PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which Planned Parenthood uses, discloses, and collects information from or about you through the Online Services. By using the Online Services, you consent to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended by us.
How do we use your information?
We and our affiliates may use the information we collect from or about you through the Online Services for a number of purposes, including, but not limited to:
providing you with products, services, or information you request;
processing any transactions you have authorized;
following up on services or information we provided to you;
contacting you about fundraising campaigns or advocacy efforts;
delivering advertisements targeted to your interests based on your previous activity on the Online Services (commonly referred to as “Targeted Advertisements”) as well as other marketing communications, promotional materials, or advertisements that may be of interest to you;
conducting research;
promoting Planned Parenthood’s services or illustrating the importance of reproductive health and rights;
processing an employment, internship, or volunteer application;
providing you with information about the Online Services or required notices;
allowing us to improve the Online Services and the services we provide, such as by better tailoring our content to our users’ needs and preferences;
generating and analyzing statistics about your use of the Online Services; and
detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Online Services.
We also may combine or aggregate any of the information we collect through the Online Services or elsewhere for any of these purposes, including for the delivery of Targeted Advertisements.
To further demonstrate how we and our affiliates may use the information we collect from or about you through the Online Services, we provide the following examples:
If you make a donation via the Online Services, your information will be added to one or more of our supporter lists and databases, and you may be contacted about other Planned Parenthood activities, news, and/or fundraising campaigns.
If you join or opt-in to our activist network, you will receive informational updates and action alerts about reproductive health and rights issues. In addition, your information will be added to one or more of our supporter lists and databases, and you may be contacted about other Planned Parenthood activities, news, and/or fundraising campaigns.
If you view certain content on the Online Services, we or a service provider of ours may later display an advertisement related to that content on a different webpage that you visit through the Online Services or on another non-Planned Parenthood website that has a relationship with the service provider.
If you use our website to submit your resume or materials for a paid or volunteer position, your information will be stored in a centralized database and may be accessible to our separately incorporated affiliates, who may be seeking candidates for full-time, part-time, or volunteer positions.
Under what circumstances do we disclose your information?
We may disclose the information we collect from or about you through the Online Services:
to our affiliates;
to service providers who work on our behalf and who have agreed to keep the information confidential and use the information solely to carry out the services that they are performing for us, including, but not limited to, service providers who process credit card transactions, facilitate our fundraising activities and campaigns, and deliver Targeted Advertisements on our behalf;
to other organizations that work with us for the provision of co-branded communications about Planned Parenthood and those organizations’ products or services;
to other organizations with whom Planned Parenthood participates in exchanges of supporter or donor information (e.g., donor list rental) and the service providers that facilitate such exchanges;
as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, a court order, or government reporting obligations;
when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary (a) to protect our rights, the integrity of the Online Services, or your safety or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the Online Services; and
to service providers, advisors, and other third parties to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets.
In addition, we may share de-identified information, such as reports on user demographics and traffic patterns, with third parties, including researchers.
The Online Services also may contain links to third-party websites and applications for your convenience and information. Planned Parenthood does not control those third-party websites and applications or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours, and we do not endorse or make any representations about those third-party websites and applications. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by third-party websites and applications that are not under our control, and such information is not governed by this Privacy Policy. Remember that we cannot protect your privacy once you leave the Online Services, so when you visit third-party websites and applications, we encourage you to review their privacy policies and be careful about the information you submit or share.

How is your information secured?
We strive to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information collected through the Online Services.

If you have concerns about the security of sensitive information, do not send it electronically.
