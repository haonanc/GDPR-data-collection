Privacy Policy
Collectibles Today Network, Ltd., which operates this Website, is an Internet marketing arm of The Bradford Group. We at the Bradford Group (identified below under "Information Sharing") are committed to protecting our customers' privacy. We know that you are concerned about how your information is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. The following notice describes our privacy policy.
Automatic Information:
This is information provided by cookies. Cookies are small alphanumeric identifier files that store information. They enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide important features that personalize our site to make your shopping faster and easier. For example they store your cart information between your visits.
You can prevent your browser from accepting cookies through its help feature, but that prevents you from shopping on our site. We recommend that you take full advantage of all the features we've designed to make shopping easy and fun.
Information That We Collect From Every Visitor:
We collect anonymous cookie information about the site pages, items, stores, and articles you view. This is not used with personally identifiable information (such as the name and address you give us when you place an order), but as aggregate information (group information) that helps us learn more about how people use and react to our site. We store information about the items you add to your cart so your cart selections are not lost between visits, but will not know who placed the items in the cart unless you send an order.
We also send or permit collection of anonymous user information by service providers such as Coremetrics and ForeSee Results, who help us analyze information about user visits, and improve services. If you would like to change your settings or opt out of the Coremetrics service, please click here . Note that by opting out of Coremetrics, you also opt out of ForeSee Results.
Personal Information You Give Us Or Ask a Third Party to Send Us:
When you place an order, we will need your name, phone number, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date so that we can process and contact you about the order. We will keep a record of this information and the items you purchase. This allows us to process and fulfill your orders and return requests, and to send you information that's of interest.
You do not have to register at our site to place an order, but ordering is much simpler when you are registered. You will choose a login name and password that will allow you to update your personal information at any time in the future. When you log on with your password, your name, address and other contact information will automatically be entered into the correct spaces of your order form. Also, you can log on with your password, and track the status of orders you have given us. Our personal registration services are provided free of charge, and you are under no obligation to purchase anything.
For your convenience, we are adding “Log In With” links on our Website to certain social networking sites and browsers, starting with Facebook and Google. These links will allow you to log into this Website using your user name and password from the third party site to check the status of your prior orders from us or place new orders. This will save you the trouble of remembering a user name and password for our Website.
In order to synchronize your log-in on our Website with your log-in credentials from the other site, we will need to receive information from the other site that will enable us to verify that you are the account holder at both sites and facilitate your use of our Website. If you choose to access this Website with your log-in credentials from one of these linked sites, or if you otherwise agree to associate your account on our Website with one of these third party sites (for example, by choosing to join or “like” our page on the social networking site), that site will send us the personal information about you from your third party account that you authorize it to share with us, such as your username and password for that account, email address and other contact information, and social profile. We may add some or all of this shared information to our databases of information you submit to us when placing orders via The Bradford Group’s customer service center, US mail, or our websites and mobile applications.  We will use and share that information in the ways disclosed below under “Information Sharing.” If you wish the third party site to discontinue sending information to us, you will need to notify the third party site of this election using the opt-out mechanisms offered by that site. This may require logging into your account with it and withdrawing your authorization to share information with us.
Surveys and Submissions
Periodically, this Website may ask customers to participate in surveys. If you participate, the information we collect may be associated with your account, and used to improve your overall customer experience.
From time to time, we may ask you to post information showing how you have used our products.

You grant us the right to use the name (real or a pseudonym) and other identifying information that you submit in connection with such content, if we choose. When you transmit a submission you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older, own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you submit; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify this Website and the Bradford Group for all claims resulting from content you supply.
You agree that you shall not submit any information:
that is, or may reasonably be considered to be, defamatory, libelous, hateful, racially or religiously biased or offensive, unlawfully threatening, obscene, pornographic or profane material or any material that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law, or unlawfully harassing to any individual, partnership or corporation; for which you were compensated or granted any consideration by any third party;
Or that contains any computer viruses, worms or other potentially damaging computer programs or files.
You acknowledge that The Bradford Group has sole discretion to publish, or not publish, your submissions in either the original or edited form.

On occasion you may receive offers mailed by e-mail or ground mail from our affiliates or their divisions, or when you call our customer service department, for items that you may enjoy. We and our affiliates or their divisions may use information you provide when you order to personalize marketing communications to you. If you order from us or one of our affiliates or their divisions, we may share your e-mail address and other contact information for use in communications concerning your order and to offer other Bradford Group items that might interest you.

Even if you opt out from information sharing generally, we must share information about your individual orders with data processors, with the sister corporation that packs, ships and bills your purchases, and with outside companies as needed to obtain approval to charge your credit card, to verify your address, and to deliver your orders.
When you visit our Website from a link on another Website, or in an ad or e-mail, a cookie will be placed on your computer, and if you make a purchase, information may be provided to the referring Website. This will occur even if you opt out from other types of information sharing. Cookies placed on your computer when you visit our site may also be used to display banner ads concerning our items when you visit certain third party sites and to track your browsing activity on our Websites and other Internet sites.
We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of our Websites, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, collecting unpaid purchase balances, and reducing credit risks. This protects you from price increases related to uncollected debt.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, we will use reasonable measures to delete the information from our records as soon as it is discovered by us and do not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law).
