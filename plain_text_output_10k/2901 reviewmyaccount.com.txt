Kount provides processing services in the US for its European Union and Swiss business partners (“Business Partners”) which include merchants and financial institutions and other applicable businesses. Kount also provides processing for US based business partners. We act as a data processor and data importer on behalf of our Business Partners, and accordingly we follow the instructions provided by each Business Partner with regard to the collection, processing and protection of personal data provided to us by each such Business Partner. Each Business Partner acts as the data controller and data exporter for any personal data within its control.

In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles (“the Principles”), Kount commits to resolve questions and complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.

Kount will remain liable under the Principles if its third party agents process such non-anonymized personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles. Any personal information that Kount collects that is not anonymous is available for European Union and Swiss individuals to access upon request for correction or deletion.
