(the “Rock Hall”), located at 1100 Rock & Roll Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44114-1022.  We take the private nature of your personal information seriously, and this Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you use the Services.  Please read this notice very carefully.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected at (a) any annexes or off-site or traveling exhibits, (b) the physical Rock Hall Store located at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Rock Hall and operated by FYE (excluding information conveyed for purposes of activating a membership purchased through the store); or (c) by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, Inc.
BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.  BY UPLOADING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE SERVICES You warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into the United States.
Children Under 18 Years of Age
The Rock Hall does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years old through the Website. Anyone under 18 years old may only access the Website or disclose information to the Rock Hall under the direct guidance and supervision of a parent or guardian. The Rock Hall believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a safe online environment for children to work within. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing personal information without parental permission. If the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with any information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they want this information deleted from our files. If the Rock Hall obtains knowledge from any source that it has information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files.
The Information we collect
As specified below, the Rock Hall may collect information about you that can be used to identify you (“Personal Information”), information necessary to process a purchase (“Purchase Information”) and information about your use of the Website gathered from cookies or similar technology, your use of Rock Hall-provided wifi or information gathered from your use of a Rock Hall wristband (“Other Information”) (collectively, “Information”).
Personal Information
When you sign up for or use the Services, you may voluntarily give us certain information about yourself.  This can include name, username, profile photo, email address, city, state, gender and any other information you provide us.  If you are using the Services on your mobile device, you may also choose to provide us with location data. 
Purchase Information
You may be requested to provide Purchase Information when you seek to purchase items (such as a membership or merchandise from our e-commerce store), make a donation, register for an activity or purchase tickets or similar transactions.  Purchase Information includes your credit card information, billing information and shipping information.  Your Purchase Information will be used only as needed to process your transaction and may be stored in our systems after your transaction is complete so that we can track and service your order, address any issues or questions that may arise with respect to your transaction or research our programs, services and other offerings.
Other Information
Like most website operators, the Rock Hall collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request when visitors use the Website. The Rock Hall’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use the Services. From time to time, the Rock Hall or its service providers may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate (for example, by publishing a report on trends in the usage of Rock Hall’s Services or service provider’s platforms).  The Rock Hall also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Services. For instance, the Rock Hall may monitor the Website to help identify threats or monitor what areas of the Website in which visitors spend significant time.
In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you are using to access the Services, including the type of device, the operating system, device settings, device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.  To learn more about the information your device makes available to us, please review the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
Like many websites, the Website may use “cookies” or similar technologies to collect information.  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. The Rock Hall may use cookies or other technology to help identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their Website access preferences. Website visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Website, with the drawback that certain features of Website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
