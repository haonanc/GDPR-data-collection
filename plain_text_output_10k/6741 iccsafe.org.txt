Automatically-Collected Information
ICC and certain third parties that advertise or provide other services on the Site may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Site when you use the Site or certain Site services, or click on advertisements on the Site or in ICC periodicals, such as the eNews or Building Safety Journal. ICC and its partners and service providers may collect and analyze information This information is collected passively through the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, and similar technologies, and is further explained below. As described further below, ICC may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
Browser Cookies: We and certain third party advertising partners may use “cookies.” Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your device. These cookies may be used:  (a) to improve or enhance your experience using the Site; (b) to deliver content, including advertising, specific to your interests; and (c) for other purposes, such as security and administrative functions. For example, cookies are used to store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not have to input those preferences every time you use the Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though different browsers may address cookies differently. Your browser may enable you to set your device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services or other features not being provided to you when you use that device.
Flash Cookies: We and certain ICC advertisers may choose to use Flash cookies in advertisements available on or through the Site or in ICC periodicals. Flash cookies, also called Flash Local Shared Objects, are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store user preferences. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. More information concerning flash cookies, including how to remove them from your computer or device is available at  here .
Web Beacons, Pixels and Clear GIFs:  We and our advertising partners may use web beacons, pixels and clear GIFs. These electronic technologies are transparent image files that, if used, allow us and our advertising partners to track Web site usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened a HTML email, how many times the email was forwarded and which links in the email were clicked. Unlike cookies, these technologies do not place files on your device.

Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising
Online Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in Section 1.2 to help us analyze how users use the Site, including by noting the third-party Web site from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking  here .
Tailored Advertising
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Site may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Site in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Web sites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Web sites and use of our Site. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Site, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed (i.e., de-identified) version of your email address along with content that you share publicly when using the Site (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the  Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link , the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link, the TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page , or Your Online Choices if you live in the European Union to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Site to learn more about advertising practices on our Site.
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ad Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Site, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising, but those ads will not be tailored based on your online activities over time. We do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
When using a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.
California Do-Not-Track Disclosure Requirements

However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.
