What personal data is processed by us?

Most of the data is collected in a pseudonymized or anonymized form.
This includes the following information:
Information when you visit our websites:
When you visit one of our websites, we may process information on the region you are visiting us from, information on your device, its operating system and browser, your user behavior on our site during the current session, and whether you have visited us before. For this, we use cookies ( click here for further information ).
Registration information:
To activate or use some of our products or services, you need to create an account („my.avira.com“). During the process of setting up your Account, we will ask you for certain personal information such as your name, email, and IP addresses, possibly supplemented by your telephone number and address details.
For mobile products, further information is added, e.g. about the device used, your provider, and the operating system.
Support inquiries:
If you contact us for support inquiries, we will store your data in connection with this particular inquiry, such as contact details, information on your hardware and software, and log data. In some cases we may ask you to provide us with additional files generated by analytical tools to handle your support inquiry.
Usage information:
When using our products and services, we collect and process personal data at various points. The respective collection and processing of personal data depends on the product used and the associated services and product features. In some cases, you may deliberately submit or provide us with files for verification. If these contain personal data, processing is carried out in accordance with the guidelines set out in this Data Protection Policy.
Here are a few examples:
Avira Connect
With Avira Connect, we provide a web console which you can use to manage your account and our software that you use. Further, we provide the option to register your smartphone, enabling you to locate it in the event of loss. To provide you with this service, we collect data on the location of your smartphone. Through Avira Connect we also manage our software that you use. For this, we store license information, the license expiration date, and the service packages you have booked.
Avira Phantom VPN
With Avira Phantom VPN we provide you with a global service for an even safer internet connection. Encrypted connections to our server locations distributed around the world let you surf anonymously and access your favorite content from anywhere. If you use Avira Phantom VPN we do not collect any data about the web pages you visit or the services you use on the internet. The information we require for our billing system only tells us when someone was online and what data volume was utilized.
Avira SafeSearch
We operate our own search engine. If you use this product we collect information on the browser type and operating system you use to perform the search, your IP address, and the type of search conducted. We store information about how you perform your search (for example, how many web searches were performed on a particular day or in a particular region). The search requests and personal data are hosted and stored on Avira servers. We work with third parties to provide you with better search results.
Avira URL Cloud
The URL Cloud feature helps identify internet addresses that are harmful to your system when you are browsing the web. URL Cloud analyzes the internet addresses you visit, to determine which internet addresses could contain malware, spam, or phishing, and warn you before opening those internet addresses. However, we remove any personally identifiable information prior to investigation. We store certain internet address data in an anonymized form and use it for debugging, statistical purposes, and to improve detection rates.
Avira Protection Cloud
For better protection against threats, our products contain features allowing us to analyze new or unknown malicious software or files from potentially hazardous sources in real time. When these features are enabled, our products use certain pre-determined rules to see whether an event on your system is caused by a virus or malware attack. If necessary, we will send a "digital fingerprint" of the unknown or suspicious data from your system to Avira for investigation in real time. In most cases, our analysis can immediately label the file as either safe or malware. Under certain circumstances the executable file may need to be sent to Avira for further analysis. In this event, files are exchanged between your computer/device and the Protection Cloud in an encrypted form. Personal files (e.g. in pdf, doc, or xls formats) or personal documents such as photos and videos are not transmitted.
Avira Home Guard
Home Guard offers you the option to detect "smart" components (such as video cameras, baby monitors, smart TVs, Wi-Fi routers, printers, media servers) within your home network and to analyze vulnerabilities. Furthermore, Home Guard will store the results to search automatically for new devices. To offer you this function, we store information on your network and the devices connected such as the MAC address, IP address, and settings of the network.
Avira Safe Things
To improve your home's safety and adapt it to deal with current threats, Safe Things by Avira is a solution which can be installed directly on your router by the network operator. This solution protects your network devices automatically against IoT threats. For this, we process information on your local network, your router, and its settings.
Avira Safe Shopping
If you use Avira Safe Shopping, it is part of our contractual obligation to present you with suitable products from other providers or other providers' conditions for the same product. Data processing is done exclusively in accordance with the performance of the contract.
Avira Software Updater
Avira Software Updater checks if your locally installed programs are up-to-date. If outdated programs are detected, Avira Software Updater notifies you about the potential safety risks or installs the respective updates automatically. Version status verification is only performed locally. No data on installed programs is sent to Avira.
Avira Password Manager
Avira Password Manager lets you safely store your passwords and synchronize them across multiple devices. Passwords are encrypted immediately after entering them. Because of the master password, Avira is unable to access your data. We use end-to-end encryption to transmit data from your devices to our servers.
Avira Identity Scanner
Avira Identity Scanner provides continuous monitoring of personal data on the web. This software protects your identity by identifying potential cyber risks which may be used for identity theft or online fraud. Furthermore, Identity Scanner will notify you about every security breach of your data. Additionally, you have the option to transfer the data to be checked to us.

For certain features, we access the location data of your device.
Why and on what legal basis do we store personal data?

For convenient and straightforward use of our products and services.
To improve and optimize the features, security, and stability of our products and services.
For administrative purposes.
Contract initiation and performance:
In general, we only store personal data needed to fulfill our contractual obligations to you (Ar. Please keep in mind that it is our duty by means of our software to protect your IT systems and data against malware and attacks. Therefore we require a range of different information. Depending on the product used, our contractual obligations include the monitoring of various internal and external data streams, programs, and files as and where necessary. If personal data supplied by third parties is processed, the processing is carried out on the contractual basis and additionally according to Article 6(1)f. GDPR. The "legitimate interest" is the protection of your systems and thus in protecting you against online and offline threats. Your need for protection outweighs the third-party's need for protection whose information may have been made accessible to you and subsequently to us.
Consent:
Your consent is required for the processing of certain data. In these events we will inform you expressly about the situation and provide you with the opportunity to allow us to process this data.
In these cases we will inform you about the purpose of the data processing and about your right of revocation.
Legitimate interest:
It is also possible to process data on the basis of our legitimate interest. Thereby, we are obliged to disclose our interest and take both your and our interests into consideration.
This is the case for the following processes:
For our security products range we scan and verify files and data streams continuously. In these cases we may process personal data of third parties. This processing is carried out on the basis of legitimate interest according to Article 6(1)f. GDPR. Our legitimate interest outweighs the protection of the third party as we protect your systems against possible malicious software (see also recital 49 of the General Data Protection Regulation).
If you use Avira Identity Scanner, we verify the personal data you entered through a high-security process in cooperation with our partner Affinion (Affinion International Ltd., UK). Should Affinion detect that data misuse is likely, we will submit this information to you on behalf of our partner. The processing of personal data behind this procedure is based on Affinion's legitimate interest to protect information security.
Storage and deletion periods:
We store personal data only to the extent required to fulfill the purpose. The storage period depends on legal requirements and the duration of the contractual relationship.
Should the data no longer be used, it will be anonymized and/or deleted in accordance with legal regulations.
Should you wish to have your data deleted, please note that we are able to block your data immediately but for legal reasons or due to technical restrictions it may take up to 180 days to permanently delete your data from the live systems.
Further, please note that after the confirmation of your deletion request it is not possible to restore your data.
