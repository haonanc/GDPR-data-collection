Consumers and Partners from which we collect information are sometimes referred to "you" or "your", as applicable.

Information Collection
Personally Identifiable Data
When you register to participate in Media.net’s program for use of Media.net Technology as an advertiser or publisher, we require you to provide us with some Personally Identifiable Data. “Personally Identifiable Data” is information that can specifically identify you. Your provision of your Personally Identifiable Data to us is completely voluntary. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Data unless you submit that information to us. Personally Identifiable Data is not collected on Partner Sites through the operation of our Technology itself. Categories of Personally Identifiable Data we may collect include:
Identity Data, which includes name or other similar identifiers.
Contact Data, which includes address, email address and telephone numbers.
Financial Data, which includes payment details including details about payments to and from you.
Personal Data
Additionally, we may also collect certain others types of information that, along Personally Identifiable Data, may be considered and specifically named "Personal Data" in certain jurisdictions, including the European Union (“EU”), such as:
Technical Data, which includes internet protocol (IP) address, cookies, browser and device information, location data and your login data.
Usage Data, which includes information about how you use our Website and Partner Sites and advertising we serve on those sites including how many times you viewed the ad, clicked the ad etc to improve our Services and also mitigate fraudulent activities.
Cookies
We collect Technical Data and Usage Data regarding your behavior and usage patterns on our Website and on our Partner Sites. We collect this type of information about you using cookies, web beacons, and other web tools ("Tools"). We do not use these Tools to store any Personally Identifiable Data. We do not have access to or control the Tools used by third parties on our Website or on any Partner Sites, and this policy does not govern the use of Tools by these third parties. Some of the Tools and the ways in which we use them are further described below:
To inform us if an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served. These cookies are not used by Media.net to build a profile of a user’s behavior nor are they used by Media.net for the purposes of behavioral tracking or behavioral targeting.
To conduct research and identify fraud and malicious activity
When you visit one of our Partner Sites, we may assign your computer one or more cookies which enable us and our Partners to deliver targeted advertisements. This form of advertising is called “behavioral advertising” or “interest based advertising”. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see ads that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please see the section titled “Opt-Out” below.
Unless you choose to provide it to us, our Technology does not collect any sensitive consumer information about you during the ad delivery process. Our Technology does not, for example, collect any social security numbers, insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, precise real-time geographic location derived through location-based services, nor any specific information about your past, present, or potential future health or medical conditions or treatments, including genetic, genomic or family medical history.
Further, while our Technology does not deliver targeted ads based on precise medical conditions or treatments or market prescription drugs, we may generate and serve targeted ads for general health products that do not require a prescription. Examples may include certain health categories like dietary supplements, fitness equipment, weight-loss products, skin-care products etc. For a full list of our health related segments, please click here.
IF YOU ARE SITUATED IN THE EU, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION “ADDITIONAL EU DISCLOSURES” THAT PERTAIN TO OUR COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE DATA AND PERSONAL DATA AND ADDITIONAL RIGHTS YOU HAVE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
Information Sharing
Subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”, Personally Identifiable Data is generally only submitted to us by our publisher or advertiser Partners in connection with their use of our Technology and we use this Personally Identifiable Data to service their accounts and respond to inbound inquiries related to sales or technical support requests.
In addition, we use your Personal Data for a variety of purposes, including:
sharing it with third parties such as advertising partners, ad networks, publishers, data providers and corporate affiliates in order to provide our services, conduct internal analysis to perform and improve our services and associated technologies;
combining data we collect about you with data we obtain from our business partners, ad networks, and/or other companies such as data providers, including our corporate affiliates in order to provide our services, conduct internal analysis in order to perform and improve our services;
inferring eligibility of users for interest, geographic and demographic-based segments;
presenting advertisements tailored to interests you have shown;
determining whether you have seen a particular advertisement before so as to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements;
identifying fraud and malicious activity
understanding the patterns of people who see advertisements;
providing insights and reporting back to our business partners, including statistical reporting in connection with the activity on a website or mobile application, optimization of location of ad placement, ad performance, reach and frequency metrics, billing, and logging ads served on a particular day to a particular website or application;
evaluating the probability and nature of connections between devices; and
creating online advertising models through lookalike modelling or similar research methodologies.
Subject to the section titled “Additional EU Disclosures”, we may share the information we collect about you with certain third parties in the following ways:
We may, from time to time, use business partners, operational service providers and subcontractors ("Service Providers") to operate and provide our services to Partners and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. As necessary under this Privacy Policy, our Service Providers are required to protect the information we provide them in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Although we exercise care in selecting our Service Providers and require them to protect information as mentioned above, they are independent third parties and we are not responsible for their privacy practices.
We may rent, sell, or share aggregated information and other information that is not Personally Identifiable Data with third parties for multiple reasons, including to develop and deliver targeted advertising and to conduct general business analysis. Information that we collect to create segments and profile information for our service may be shared with our Partners. We may combine information we collect with additional information collected from other sources. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover any third party's use or handling of your information once it is shared. While we do not collect Personally Identifiable Data about you when you view or interact with an ad, there is a possibility that our Technology and our Partners will make assumptions or infer things about you (or anyone using your devices or browsers) in order to display more relevant ads.
We provide information to third parties for legal process (e.g., in response to a subpoena or civil or criminal investigative demand, court order, or a request from law enforcement or other government agency); to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; to protect the security and integrity of our assets and business operations; or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may disclose your information when we believe it is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Media.net, our Partners, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the terms of service of our Website or other agreements or policies.
We may also provide information to third parties in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
