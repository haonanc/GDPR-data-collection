II. Data Collection and Usage
We collect, store and use your personal information to allow you to use our Site, to communicate with us, and for the other purposes described in more detail below or as we may specify at the time of collection.
We collect and use information about you in several ways. We may receive information directly from you when you send us email, share a photo, complete a form on our Site (such as a survey or a request for a guide or a sweepstakes entry), sign up to receive email from us, or call us with questions. We may receive your social media profile when you share articles on our Site using your social account. We also collect information electronically when you browse our Site. We do not store it longer than necessary.
There are two types of information we collect – anonymous and personal. Anonymous information is information that cannot be used to identify you individually. We collect anonymous information automatically. Personal information is information that can be used to identify you individually, such as your name, address, email address, or phone number. Except for your IP address, we collect personal information only when you give it to us. You may be asked to provide personal information anytime you are in contact with us. We may share your personal information with our Florida tourism partners, as described in detail below. We and our Florida tourism partners may combine your personal information with other information to provide and improve our products, services, and advertising. You are not required to provide any personal information that we request, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our services or respond to any questions you might have.
The type of information we collect from you depends on how you interact with us. You can use our Site without providing us with any information other than anonymous information we collect automatically.
A. Information you provide directly.  
We obtain information that identifies you personally directly from you. We ask for your contact information (name, street address, email address, and phone numbers) when you request a guide, sign up for electronic newsletters, answer a survey, enter a sweepstakes or other game or contest, participate in other promotional activities, or share your photos with us. We may also ask for information that helps us understand more about your interest in Florida tourism, such as demographic information like household information and age group, and information about your travel interests. By law we must ask prize winners for their social security numbers so that we can report their winnings to the IRS. When you share a photo with us, we may obtain your credit line (an acknowledgement of who shot the photo), caption and date and place the photo was taken.
We use the information that you voluntarily provide to reply to your requests, to update and improve the content on our Site or in our electronic newsletters, and to assist with marketing research. We use photos you share with us to promote Florida vacations.
