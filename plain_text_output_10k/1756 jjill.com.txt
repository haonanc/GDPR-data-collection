information we collect
In order to provide the services  you request, we ask you for certain kinds of personal information.
For example, when you place an order on our site or over the phone, make a  purchase at our stores, create an online account, visit our web site, sign up  to receive emails from us, request to "chat" with a customer service  associate, or send us an email, you provide us with certain personally  identifiable information, such as your name, email address, postal address,  phone number and credit or debit card number. In addition to this information,  we also maintain a record of your purchases from jjill.com, our catalog, and  our stores.
If you participate in one of our  promotions, contests, surveys, or provide product reviews, you may provide us  with additional personal information such as your age or date of birth.
In addition, for each visitor to  the web site, our web server automatically collects the following  non-personally-identifiable information: your Internet service provider's  address, the referring URL, your browser type and version, and information on  the pages you access on our site.  This  information is collected using technology including cookies and pixel  tags.  For more information on our use of  cookies, please see the section below.
We may also collect information from other sources, including address  verification services and market research services. We may combine information  you provide with other information available to us from other sources,  including demographic information.
using information  we collect
At J.Jill, we want to provide you with the best possible shopping experience.  When we take an order on the phone or when you make a purchase online or at a  store, we use your information to process your purchase, answer questions you  may have, mail catalogs to you, and provide you with periodic emails, mailings  and phone calls about our merchandise and promotions.
Currently, we also gather online information about your purchases and shopping  activities to improve the content of our web site, to enhance your online  shopping experience, to improve our product selection, and to use in future  marketing and promotional activities for our web site, our catalogs and our  J.Jill stores.  We may use this  information to better understand your shopping preferences and provide you with  more relevant offers, information and promotions.
information we share  with others
In some instances, we use third party companies to provide services for us,  including providing customer and Internet services, taking and fulfilling  orders, conducting J.Jill promotions and surveys, assisting in maintaining and  managing customer information, and communicating effectively with our  customers. These third party companies are given access to the information they  need to provide these services, and may use cookies in order to do so.
If you apply for the J.Jill credit card online, you provide the personal  information needed to process your application (including your social security  number) directly to Comenity Bank, the issuer and the administrator of the  credit card program. If you apply for the J.Jill credit card by phone or in the  stores, we collect that information from you and provide it to Comenity Bank.  Comenity Bank is independent of J.Jill and has its own privacy and security  policies.
We may use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the  Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web  site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use  information about your visits to this and other Web sites to more accurately target  advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected  through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by  most major web sites. No personally identifiable information is collected or  used in this process.   While www.jjill.com  is not configured to recognize a “do not track” signal from you browser, you do  have choices regarding behavioral advertising.  If you would like more information about this  practice and your choices for opting out, click here .

On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental  request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may  also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or  investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for  marketing or commercial purposes.
