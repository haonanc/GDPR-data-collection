The Provider attempts to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible.
We currently offer users the option of participating in online marketing campaigns to request quotes on products including but not limited to insurance and automotive products (referred to herein as “Services”). By using the Site and the Services, you consent to the following terms.

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. If you are between the ages of 16-18 you must have your parent’s approval to register. If we learn that a user is under the age of eighteen without valid parental approval, we will terminate the account and delete the user’s information.

B. Information collected through use of the Site and Services

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
