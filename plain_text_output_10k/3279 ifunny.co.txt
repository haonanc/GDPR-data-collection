This is the purpose of our privacy policy.
There are certain things that you should be aware of when using our website and mobile applications. First, the iFunny website and mobile applications are publicly accessible and searchable to users and visitors around the world.

If you do choose to create an account, however, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide you with the services that you have requested. This may include your username, password, email address, phone number.

We may also collect data from you through the use of cookies and other technologies. This helps us understand how you use the iFunny website or mobile applications and to understand any patterns that may be associated with your use of our services. This aids us in developing or improving our services in response to your needs or wants.

Persistent cookies are stored as a file on your computer or mobile device that remain on your computer or mobile device even after you close your web browser. Persistent cookies can be read by the website that created the cookie when you revisit it again. We may use persistent cookies when we utilize Google Analytics or other analytics providers, which are intended to track the origin and behavior of traffic to the iFunny website and mobile applications. We may also, from time to time, receive data from third parties including analytics providers or advertising networks such as Google, Facebook, or Apple.

You may ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into your account to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out link in any marketing message sent to you.
Disclosure of Personal Data
We only share your personal data in limited circumstances.
We may share or disclose your personal data with your consent or at your direction.
We may also share your data with certain third parties to aid us in operating the iFunny website or mobile applications. For example, we may share your personal data with third parties, such as analytics providers, to utilize their software tools and measure the effectiveness of our advertisements. We may also share personal data, such as device IDs, with third party advertisers to help them determine whether they should serve an ad to you. The data that we share with these third parties does not include your email address, name, phone number, or username.
We may also share your personal data with our accountants, auditors, insurers, or attorneys where doing so is necessary to protect the interests of iFunny or to comply with any law or regulation.
We may also share your personal data with government or law enforcement agencies when we are required to report our data processing activities, upon receipt of an exigent circumstances request, upon receipt of a duly authorized subpoena or court order, or where doing so is necessary to protect our employees, contractors, or property.
Finally, we may share your personal data to a third party if we sell, transfer, or merge any part of our business or assets. In the event that we share your personal data in the sale, transfer, or merger of any part of our business or assets, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your personal data when transferred to the new entity.
Management, Protection, and Retention of Your Personal Data
If you have registered an account with us and are a citizen of the European Union, we provide you with account settings that let you modify, correct, or delete the personal data that you have provided to us that is associated with your account. Whether you are located in the European Union or elsewhere, to stop our collection and use of your personal data, you need only to delete your account.
If you have not registered an account with us, we only collect technical data from you. To stop our collection and use of your technical data, you need only cease using the iFunny website and uninstall the iFunny mobile applications.
We may transfer your personal data to countries outside of the European Union, which may not offer the same level of protection. Many of our third-party service providers are located within the United States and their processing of personal data will involve a transfer of data outside of the European Union. Whenever personal data is transferred outside of the European Union, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security by transferring your personal data to countries that the European Commission has approved as providing an adequate level of protection, by using contracts approved by the European Commission, or by using US-based providers that are a part of the EU-US Privacy Shield.
We also put data security measures into place to protect your personal data. We allow access to your personal data only by employees and service providers who have a need to know or access your personal data on our instructions. We will notify you and any regulatory body of any breach of your personal data or our security measures if and when we are legally required to do so.
We will only retain your personal data for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it is collected under this Privacy Policy or for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
Right to Access Data
Under the law, you may have a right to request access to your personal data for correction, transfer, erasure, or restriction, or to object to its processing or withdraw your consent. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
You do not need to pay a fee to access your PII or to exercise your rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unreasonable or excessive.
To confirm your request, we may need to request specific information from you as a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to an unauthorized third party. We will attempt to respond to all legitimate requests within thirty days.
Participation in Privacy Shield
iFunny participates in the EU/Swiss and US Privacy Shield, which is a program intended to ensure that your personal data is safeguarded if it is transferred to the United States. A list of Privacy Shield certified companies is located at https://www.privacyshield.gov/list . iFunny is committed to adhering to the principles of the Privacy Shield and to the protection of personal data as required by that program.
For disputes related to iFunny’s participation in the EU/Swiss and US Privacy Shield, iFunny has designated the European Union Data Protection Officers to serve as an Independent Recourse Mechanism for dispute resolution. This means that iFunny has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European Union Data Protection Officers to resolve disputes pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework at no cost to you. Should you wish to file a dispute, you may do so at no cost through the European Union Data Protection Officers panel.
iFunny recognizes that, as a participant in the EU/Swiss and US Privacy Shield, it is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC, the Department of Transportation or any other US authorized statutory body.
Should iFunny fail to abide by the EU/Swiss and US Privacy Shield, it may face liability in cases of onward transfers to third parties.
Third Party Links
Our services may include links to third party websites and applications. By clicking on third party links, you may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party links and you are advised their respective privacy policies.
Responding to Do Not Track Signals
You can generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website. Our websites are not currently set up to respond to browser do-not-track signals, but you can configure your browser settings to reject all cookies or prompt you before a cookie is set.
California Privacy Rights
California residents have the right to receive information that identifies any third-party companies or individuals that we have shared your personal data with in the previous calendar year, as well as a description of the categories of personal data disclosed to that third party. You may obtain this information once a year and free of charge by contacting iFunny at support@ifunny.co .
