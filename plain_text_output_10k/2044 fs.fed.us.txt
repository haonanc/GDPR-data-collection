Privacy Policy
The United  States Forest Service (FS) takes the security of information very seriously. We  take precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of  the information we collect at this site. Such measures include access controls  designed to limit access to the information to the extent necessary to accomplish  our mission. We also employ various security technologies to protect the  information stored on our systems. We routinely test our security measures to  ensure that they remain operational and effective.
For site security purposes and to  ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government  computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic  to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise  cause damage.
Except for authorized law enforcement  investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or  their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are  scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and  Records Administration guidelines.
Unauthorized attempts to upload  information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and  may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the  National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
The information you manually provide on a Forest Service website will be  used only for the purpose for which you provided it. We will protect your  information consistent with the principles of the Privacy  Act of 1974 , the E-Government Act of 2002 , and the Federal  Records Act .
Privacy Policy
This website is provided as a public service  by the USDA  Forest Service .  Information presented on this website is considered public information  and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise indicated. Use of appropriate  byline/photo/image credit is requested. 
For site management, information is  collected (see the example below) for  statistical purposes. This government computer system uses software programs to  create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what  information is of most and least interest, determining technical design  specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas. For site  security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all  users, this system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to  identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise  cause damage.
To protect your privacy, this site does not  use persistent "cookies."  Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts  are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are  used for no other purposes than those stated in this notice.  Unauthorized attempts to upload information  or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable  under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1987 and the National  Information Infrastructure Protection Act .
Personally Identifiable Information
As a general rule, the United States Department of Agriculture  (USDA) and the Forest Service  does not collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) about you when you  visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us.  Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving  the Forest Service your permission to use the information for a specific,  stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may result in the  Forest Service’s inability to provide you with the service you desire.
If you choose to provide us with PII on an FS website, through such methods  as completing a web form, we will use that information to help us provide you  the information or service you have requested. The information we may receive  from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.
We only share the PII you give us with another government agency if your  inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never  create individual profiles or give your PII to any private organizations. The  Forest Service never collects information for commercial marketing.
If we store your PII in a system of records designed to retrieve  information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address,  home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), so that we may  contact you, we will safeguard the information you provide to us in accordance with  the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). The Act requires all  public-facing sites or forms that request PII to prominently and conspicuously  display a privacy notice.
The notice must address the following criteria:
Legal authorization to collect information about you;
Purpose for which the information will be used;
Routine uses for disclosure of information outside of the Forest  Service and the Department of Homeland Security;
Whether your providing the information is voluntary or mandatory under law;  and
Effects if you choose to not provide the requested information.
For each System of Record, we have  completed a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and System of Records Notice (SORN)  providing details about the privacy protections and redress options available  for the contact information we collect from the public. This information may be  used to distribute information to you and to perform various administrative  tasks. 
Email Communications
Many of our  programs and Web sites allow you to send us email messages. We will use the  information you provide to respond to your inquiry. We will only send you  general information via email. You should be reminded that email may not  necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore, we suggest that you do  not send sensitive Personally Sensitive Information (such as your Social  Security number) to us via email. If your intended email communication is  sensitive, e.g., it includes information such as your bank account, charge  card, or Social Security number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail.  Another alternative may be submission of data through a secure program Web  site, if available.
Electronic  mail messages that meet the definition of records in the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. § 3101) are covered under  the same disposition schedule as all other Federal records. This means that  emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time  if those emails meet the definition of Federal records. Electronic messages  that are not records are deleted when no longer needed.
Third-Party Web sites  and Applications
The Forest  Service may use social media Web sites to engage in dialogue, share information  and media, and collaborate with the public.  The Forest Service may also  use these Web sites to make information and services widely available, while  promoting transparency and accountability, as a service for those seeking  information about or services from the Forest Service. The privacy policies for  approved social media platforms are linked to the right of this privacy  policy. 
The Forest  Service does not use third-party Web sites to solicit and collect personally  identifiable information (PII) from individuals. Any PII collected by the  third-party Web site will not be transmitted or stored by the Forest Service;  no PII will be disclosed, sold or transferred to any other entity outside the Forest  Service or the USDA, unless required for law enforcement purposes or by statute  consistent with the Privacy Act.
Children Online
The Forest  Service is committed to the protection of children’s online privacy. The Children’s  Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online  from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s  parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal  information from a child under age 13. If an FS Web site intends to collect  information from children under 13 years old, COPPA-required information and  instructions will be provided by the specific Web page that collects  information about the child. The Web page will specify exactly what the  information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.
Visiting Other Web sites
Our Web site  contains links to international agencies, private organizations, and some  commercial entities. These Web sites are not within our control and may not  follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices. Once you link to  another site, you are subject to the policies of that site. All Federal Web  sites, however, are subject to the same Federal policy, security, and  accessibility mandates.

Example: Information Collected from the USDA Forest                Service Website for Statistical Purposes
Below is an example of the information  collected based on a standard request for a World Wide Web document:
xxx.yyy.com - - [28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] "GET /news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" 200 16704 Mozilla  3.0/www.altavista.digital.com
xxx.yyy.com (or 123.123.23.12)-- this is the  host name (or IP address) associated with the requester (you as the visitor).  In this case, (.com) the requester is coming from a commercial address.  Depending on the requester's method of network connection, the host name (or IP  address) may or may not identify a specific computer. Connections via many  Internet Service Providers assign different IP addresses for each session, so  the host name identifies only the ISP. The host name (or IP address) will  identify a specific computer if that computer has a fixed IP address.
[28/Jan/1997:00:00:01 -0500] -- this is the  date and time of the request
"GET /news/nr012797.html HTTP/1.0" -- this is the location of the requested file on the web server 200 -- this is  the status code - 200 is OK - the request was filled
16704 -- this is the size of the requested  file in bytes
Mozilla 3.0 -- this identifies the type of browser  software used to access the page, which indicates what design parameters to use  in constructing the pages
www.altavista.digital.com - this indicates  the last site the person visited, which indicates how people find our site
Requests for other  types of documents use similar information. No personally-identifying  information is collected.
