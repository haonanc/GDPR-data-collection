Aspects of this Privacy Policy are highlighted below only for your convenience. These highlights do not             substitute, replace, or override any aspect of the full Privacy Policy.
Information collection
When you use the App, you choose to route some or all of                         your device's data traffic through or to, the App. We                         automatically collect some information routed through the                         App, such as information about your device, mobile                         applications, and data usage. You also may provide us with                         certain personal information when you use the App.
Use of information
We use the information we collect, including to provide the                         App and its services to you, analyze usage of our App and                         other applications on your device, improve the App,                         communicate with you, and provide analytics and other                         services to third parties.
Sharing information
We may share, sell, transmit, or otherwise make available                         to third parties information that does not identify                         specific persons without restriction. Other than the                         limited circumstances described in this Policy, we do not                         make your personal information available to third parties                         unless the information sharing is described to you at the                         point of collection or we obtain your consent.
Your choices
You may choose not to provide the personal information we                         request. However, not providing information we request may                         restrict your ability to use certain App features. If you                         do not wish for the App to collect information about you in                         accordance with this Privacy Policy you should refrain from                         using the App and delete the App from your device. Under                         certain circumstances, you may make certain choices related                         to your information, such as requesting access to your                         information or requesting that we delete it.
Security
We maintain safeguards to help protect against loss,                         misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or                         destruction of the information we receive.
International transfers
We may store and process information, including through                         third-party or Affiliate hosting services, in the United                         States, EEA, and other international jurisdictions,                         including jurisdictions that may not have been deemed by                         the European Commission to provide a comparable level of                         protection to your data as that of the EEA.
Third party activities
If you view third-party websites or use third-party                         applications or services while using the App, then this                         Privacy Policy will not apply to information collected by                         that third party's website, application, or service.
Changes to this privacy policy
If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy we                         will notify you by email, through prominent notice in our                         Apps, or by posting a prominent notice on our Website.

Full Privacy Policy
We collect, use, share or otherwise process your personal information, as             described in further detail below, when we have an appropriate basis for             doing so. For example, we may process your personal information as             necessary to provide services, such as the App, that are subject to terms             you have accepted, such as our end user license agreements or Terms of Use.             We may process your personal information for purposes of pursuing our             legitimate interests, if doing so is consistent with your rights and             appropriate to the context, such as to provide and improve our products and             services; to communicate with you; to perform business analysis and             research; to provide analytics services; to prevent fraud; to enforce legal             claims, our policies, and terms; in connection with a transfer of assets;             and for security purposes. We may also process your personal information to             comply with legal obligations or when we obtain your consent to do so.
What information does SEVEN collect?
Information You Provide
You may provide us with certain personal information when you use the App.             For example, we may collect your email address when you request support             through the App. Additionally, if you otherwise contact us, we may keep a             record of your communication, contact information, and other information             you provide to us.
Information We Collect Automatically
When you use the App, you choose to route some or all of your device's data             traffic through, or to, the App. The App processes this information on your             device in order to provide ad-blocking services. For example, the App will             analyze outgoing data and, when it identifies requests to retrieve ads, the             App will block the request. The App will also analyze information your             device transmits to facilitate ad-blocking services. Generally, the data             transmitted through or to the App resides on your device, and we do not             collect it and store in on our servers. However, we may automatically             collect some information routed through the App, such as the following:
Information about your device, including device identifiers, such as our App                 identifier and Google Analytics for Firebase identifier                 associated with your device, the type of device and its operating                 system, the mobile carrier or network, IP address, battery information,                 and general location information (based on cell tower data).
Information about your mobile applications and data usage, including                 the applications installed on your device, your use of those                 applications, webpage addresses (URLs), and the amount of data you use.
The battery and network performance of your device, including signal                 quality readings and information on failed calls.
How does SEVEN use the collected information?
We may use the information we collect, including personal information, to             provide products and services and to support our business functions. For             example, we may use this information to:
Provide the App and its services to you.
Communicate with you, including to provide you with information about                 SEVEN or third-party products, services, and events; respond when you                 communicate with us; and send you information you request or that we                 think might interest you, such as App updates.
Perform business and data analysis and research, including analysis of                 how users use applications and data; provide analytics and other                 services to third parties; maintain, improve, troubleshoot, and                 administer our App; provide customer support to our users; perform                 internal recordkeeping; and to otherwise support our business                 operations.

We retain personal information for as long as we reasonably need it to             fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, comply with our legal             obligations and policies, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
How does SEVEN share the collected information?
 
We may share personal information (as well as non-personal information) in             the following instances:
Affiliates. We may share information with our Affiliates (as defined above) to help                 provide and improve our App (such as by providing analytics) and to                 provide our Affiliates' services (including by providing you with a                 better and more personalized experience).
Service Providers. We may share information with third parties that perform services on                 our behalf. For example, we may use third parties to host our services                 and databases, perform analyses or research, or send communications on                 our behalf.
When Required by Law, to Respond to Legal Process, to Prevent                     Fraud, etc. We may share information to comply with a legal obligation; when we                 believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of                 governmental authorities; to respond to a legal request or legal                 process; to detect, prevent, or address fraud and other illegal                 activity; to protect the rights, property, safety, or security of                 ourselves, our Affiliates, you, or others, including as part of                 investigations; to enforce or verify compliance with our policies; to                 enforce our rights; to respond to an emergency; if we believe that you                 have abused your rights to use the App or violated an applicable law;                 or in connection with any dispute between you and us with respect to                 the App.
In Connection with a Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, make a sale or transfer of                 assets, are otherwise involved in an actual or potential merger or                 business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may disclose and                 transfer information to one or more third parties in connection with                 that transaction, proposed transaction, or bankruptcy proceeding. We                 also may disclose information to our attorneys and consultants.
Other Disclosures. We also may share information as described to you at the point of                 collection or pursuant to your consent.
Your Choices
You may choose not to provide the personal information we request. However,             not providing information we request may restrict your ability to use             certain App features. For example, you may be able to restrict the             collection of personal information or functionality through your device's             operating system, but doing so may prevent you from using the functionality             of the App.
You may be able to control many tracking tools, including cookies, from             your browser. In particular, you may refuse to accept browser cookies by             activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, this browser             setting may not apply to your use of the App. If you do not wish for the             App to collect information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy             you should refrain from using the App and delete the App from your device.             For example, to opt out of future collection of information we use in             connection with Google Analytics for Firebase features we have implemented,             described above, you must stop using and uninstall the App.
Some Internet browsers have a 'do not track' feature that lets you tell             websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These             features are not yet uniform and may not apply to the App, so we are             currently not set up to respond to such signals.
If you stop using the App, you can request that we remove the personal             information that we collected from you through the App by contacting us at support@seven.com . Users of the App             may review or modify their personal information collected and stored by             SEVEN through their use of the App by contacting us at support@seven.com . If you are             located in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or Switzerland, then you may             have the right to request access to, correction of, erasure of, or the             transfer of your personal information, as well as the right to object to or             restrict the processing of your personal information. You can exercise             these rights, if applicable, by contacting us at support@seven.com . We may             not be able to accommodate all requests, such as when we believe the change             would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be             incorrect.
Security
We maintain safeguards to help protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized             access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the information we             receive.
International Transfers
We may store and process information, including through third-party or             Affiliate hosting services, in the United States, the EEA, and other             international jurisdictions. As a result, we may, with your consent,             transfer the personal information described above from your device to a             jurisdiction with different data protection laws than the jurisdiction in             which you are located or reside for the purposes described above. Some of             these jurisdictions may not have been deemed adequate by the European             Commission to provide a comparable level of protection to that of the EEA             or Switzerland. However, we will treat your personal information as subject             to, and protect it in accordance with, this Policy. You may use the App's             settings menu to withdraw your consent to transfer your personal             information as described in this paragraph.
Links to Other Websites and Services; Third-Party Content and Data Collection
Third party websites, applications, and other services accessed while you             are using the App are not under the control of SEVEN and SEVEN shall have             no responsibility or liability for the content or privacy practices of any             such websites, applications, or other services or any link at any time. If             you view third-party websites or use third-party applications or services             while using the App, then this Privacy Policy will not apply to information             collected by that third party's website, application, or service, and you             must read the privacy policy associated with that website, application, or             service to determine how your information will be collected, used, and             disclosed. We do not allow third parties to use the App to collect personal             information about your online activities over time and across different             websites, applications, and other online products or services. However,             websites, applications, and other online products or services that transmit             traffic through the App may engage in such collection or permit other             parties to do so. For example, a website that you access may collect             personal information about your web browsing history across multiple             websites over time or allow another party to do so.
Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our privacy practices at             any time and without prior notice to you. If we make any material changes,             we may notify you by contacting you through our services, emailing you (to             the address specified in your account, if we have an address for you), or             by posting a notice on the App or our website-or by some combination of             these methods. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy for the             latest information on our privacy practices.
If you do not agree to any modifications to this Policy, your sole recourse             is to immediately stop all use of the App. Your continued use of the App             following the posting of any modifications to this Policy will constitute             your acceptance of the revised Policy.
Contacting Us/Reporting Violations
If you have any questions or comments about this Policy or our privacy practices, or to report any violations             of the Policy or abuse of the App, please contact us at support@seven.com .
