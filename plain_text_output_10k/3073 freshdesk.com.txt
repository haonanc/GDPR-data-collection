What information does this Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers Bidz’ treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Bidz gathers when you are accessing Bidz’ Website and when you use Bidz’ services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, or to individuals that Bidz does not employ or manage.  Also, we do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.
What Personal Information does Bidz collect?
The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and make purchases via the Website. We collect the following types of information from our customers.
Personal information you give us:
We may receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected may include your name, email address, gender, zip code, country, IP address, browser information, and, if you make a purchase through our Website, your credit card number, credit card security code, expiration date, billing address, and shipping address. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features, and you may not be able to complete a purchase through the Website. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as allowing you to purchase items, improving the content of the Website, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.
We do not direct any of our content specifically to children. Users of our Website are required to be at least 18 years old, and any user under 18 is not an authorized user. Additionally, if we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will promptly delete any Personal Information we have collected about that user.

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Bidz automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, and any items you may purchase. This information may be used to customize the content you see on our Website or to communicate with you about specials and new features.
Usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components may also be used in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Bidz never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

Most mobile devices allow you to control or disable location services in the device's setting's menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or the manufacture of your particular device.

We may receive or collect supplemental information about you from third parties sources and add it to our account information.
