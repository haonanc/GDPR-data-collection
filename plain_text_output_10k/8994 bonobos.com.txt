This Privacy Policy explains how Bonobos collects, uses, and shares your personal information. ("Personal information" is information that identifies you or that can reasonably be linked to information that identifies you.) This Privacy Policy applies when you visit our website, mobile app, official social media sites, or other online properties, (collectively "Sites"), and at our Guideshop locations in person. Bonobos recognizes that you care about how your information is used, and your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains the choices you can make about what information we share. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy that increase our rights to use personal information that we have previously collected about you, we will notify you either through an email to your registered email address or by prominent posting on the Sites and, where appropriate, we will obtain consent from you either through email or the Sites.

HOW BONOBOS USES COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
When you visit our Sites, Bonobos may place pieces of code, commonly referred to as "cookies," or similar technology on your devices. Bonobos may begin collecting information about you or your activity on devices associated with you through cookies or similar technologies as soon as you visit our Sites. We use advertising identifiers similar to cookies in our mobile applications. By using our Sites, you permit Bonobos to collect and use your personal information from activity on devices associated with you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Bonobos uses cookies for a number of purposes: First, we use persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to our Sites and to collect and analyze information about your online activity to help us improve our services. Second, we use session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Sites to better understand how you interact with the Sites, and to monitor aggregate use of our Sites by Bonobos users. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off of the Sites and close your browser.
We also may use "pixel tags," "web beacons," and other technologies on our Sites to collect usage, demographic, and geographic location data, which allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Sites, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.
Some internet browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome) offer their own opt outs for interest-based advertising. The ad networks and ad service providers we participate with may not recognize these opt outs. Information about how to opt out of certain online interest-based advertising is discussed in the next section of this Privacy Policy.
THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS
Third parties, including advertisers, may collect information, potentially including personal information, about your activities over time and across different websites when you use the Sites. Those third parties may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, mobile application advertising identifiers and other technologies. Those third parties may also provide Bonobos with information and reports about data collection, ad response measurement, analytical information, and assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements.
Collection of your information by third parties is not governed by this Privacy Policy. Please consult the privacy policies of those third parties to determine how they collect and use your information. Many third-party advertisers and some web browsers and mobile devices allow you to opt out of third-party advertising. Information and resources regarding how to opt out of interest-based advertising are available from the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ .
HOW TO MODIFY OR DELETE PERSONAL INFORMATION
You can request that we review, modify, and delete your personal account information by contacting us or by making edits via the "My Accounts" section of the Sites. If you request that we delete your personal information, your account may become deactivated. If you would like us to modify or delete your account information, please contact us at privacy@bonobos.com with a request that we delete your personal information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
HOW BONOBOS PROTECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION
Bonobos has implemented an information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical controls designed reasonably to safeguard your personal information.
BUSINESS TRANSFERS AND CORPORATE CHANGES
We reserve the right to disclose, sell, or transfer all information related to the Sites, including personal information:
to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of one or more of the Sites; or
in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, or restructuring; the sale of substantially all of our stock and/or assets; or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process.
INFORMATION WE TRANSFER
The Sites to which this Privacy Policy applies are subject to U.S. law, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy. By using the Sites or providing us with your information, you are directly transferring your information to us in the United States. In addition, we may transfer the information that we collect through the Sites to other countries where we do business. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you reside. When we transfer personal information we collect about you to other countries, we will protect that information as described in this Privacy Policy, even though a given country may not have the same privacy and data protection laws as the country in which you reside. You agree to and acknowledge our collection, transfer, and processing of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
Our Sites are general audience sites not directed at children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that any information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that information.
