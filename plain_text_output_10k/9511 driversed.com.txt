Privacy Statement
This privacy policy describes how Interactive Solutions, Inc. ("Interactive Solutions"), Easy Driving School, LLC ("EDS"), each wholly owned entities of eDriving, LLC, and eDriving, LLC collect and use                                     the personal information you provide us. It also describes the choices available                                     to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and                                     update this information.
Aggregate Information
We do not share aggregated demographic information with anyone. We use this information                                     for statistical purposes and to better inform the construction of our sites and                                     courses.
Associate Center
If a user elects to become an associate and use our referral service for informing                                     a friend about our site, once the referred friend decides to take a course, we request                                     they provide their email address or drivers license number as a discount code. We store this information for the sole purpose of tracking the success of                                     our referral program. If a user wishes to delete, edit, or access their information,                                     they may do so by logging into their account or by sending an email to info@driversed.com . The emails sent to friends of the users are one-time                                     emails. The friends of the users will not receive any more emails unless they choose                                     to receive more emails or if they become a registered member of our site. Depending                                     on the particular associate program, the referral may receive a discount for our                                     course. Once payment has been received from a referral, the associate will receive                                     a commission payment.
Business Transitions
In the event Interactive Solutions goes through a business transition, such as a                                     merger, acquisition by another company, or sells a portion of its assets, users'                                     personally identifiable information will, in most instances, be part of the assets                                     transferred. Users will be notified via email and a prominent notice will be placed                                     on our websites for 30 days prior to change of ownership or control of their personally                                     identifiable information. If as a result of the business transition, the users'                                     personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that                                     stated at the time of collection, they will be given a choice consistent with our                                     notification changes.
Communications from the Site, Special Offers and Updates
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify successful enrollment. When an account is created, the user enters our list database, and is sent notifications relevant to the chosen course. We also send an email when the user's due date is near and after they graduate successfully. Upon graduating the course users are added to our newsletter list—these newsletters offer news, product information, and discount opportunity information across all eDriving brands.
We provide a way to opt out of our news, promotion, and associate emails. Users can click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email or call our toll free number (888-651-2886) to have their emails blocked. We then remove the user's email from our mailing list. The emails that users send to their friends are one-time emails unless the friend of the user chooses to receive more emails or becomes a registered member of the site as well.

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about                                     the user in our servers. Cookies are only data used to "remember" where                                     you are when visiting a website—they cannot erase or read any data on your                                     computer. Cookies are linked to personally identifiable information while on our                                     site. The cookies help to keep track of the user's progress while on our sites.                                     They keep a record of the times and dates you log in and out of each section of                                     the course. They also help our websites to remember where users log off in their                                     individual courses. It is necessary for the users to enable cookies, as some certain                                     features will not work without them.
The use of cookies by our partners and affiliates is not covered by our privacy policy.                                     We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners and affiliates                                     may use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order                                     for you to use the shopping cart and other payment methods.
Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes Internet protocol                                     (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,                                     platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer                                     the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information                                     for aggregate use. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information                                     to enable our web-based service (for details see below).
We store information that we collect through cookies to create user profiles. A profile                                     is stored information that details what section of the course you are using. Collected                                     information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to help keep                                     track of their progress. This profile is used to update the user's final certificate                                     of completion for the course. As long as you are using our                                     websites, cookies will be used to track your activity. Once you have completed a                                     course, you may disable our sites' cookies in your web browser.
We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),                                     that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.                                     Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies,                                     and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,                                     which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly                                     on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We                                     do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable                                     information.
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been                                     opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications                                     and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
We also use Click Chat software to operate our online customer service chat room.                                     No new personally identifiable information is collected during these chat sessions.
Correcting/Updating/Deleting Personally Identifiable Information
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone,                                     email or postal address), we provide a way to correct, update or delete users' personally                                     identifiable information. This can usually be done at the course "Summary"                                     section or by emailing our Customer Support at info@driversed.com .                                     [Or use our telephone and postal information listed in the Contact Information section.]
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed                                     to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to                                     comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Customer Service
We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in                                     regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email, online live support,                                     or phone, in accordance with the user's preferences.
Information Collection
We are the sole owner of the information collected on our websites.                                     We collect information from our users during enrollment. Confidential information                                     about you will not be provided to anyone other than yourself, or in the case of                                     traffic school students, the court that you have selected as responsible for your                                     citation. Under no circumstances will we provide any details about you to junk emailers                                     or other direct marketers. We only share your personally identifiable information                                     with third parties only as outlined within this privacy policy or if required by                                     law to do so.
Information Use
The information we collect is used to help us access your record in case you are                                     experiencing technical difficulties while taking the course. Unique identifiers                                     such as a drivers license number, citation number, and County and State information                                     are used to identify you as the user and to help in accurate certificate processing                                     for your court or insurance company. Demographic information is collected to help                                     us improve our services. By getting to know our students (age groups, education                                     level, languages spoken), we are able to make the necessary changes to our sites                                     and course offerings in order to better serve them.
The personally identifiable information we collect online is used for verification                                     of your identity while taking our online course. We only share your personally identifiable                                     information with third parties only as outlined within this privacy policy. While                                     taking our course online, security questions will appear on the screen asking you                                     to identify yourself. The correct answers to the questions are based on the information                                     you provided us with during enrollment. Each course has a different security measure                                     depending on the State where you are taking drivers education or where the citation                                     was issued.
Links
Our websites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible                                     for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware                                     when they leave our sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every website                                     that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely                                     to information collected by Interactive Solutions or EDS.
Notification of Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy                                     policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always                                     aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances,                                     if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy                                     under which the information was collected.
If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a                                     manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users                                     via email prior to the change becoming effective. Users will have a choice as to                                     whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users                                     have opted out of all communication with our sites, or deleted/deactivated their                                     account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personally identifiable                                     information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes                                     in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our                                     database, we will post a prominent notice on our websites notifying users of the                                     change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have                                     opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy                                     practices.
Publicly Posted Information
One section of our DriversEd.com website titled, "I Am Not A Statistic"                                     allows our members to write into the website and share stories to help discourage                                     dangerous driving. When submitting stories to our site in order to have them posted,                                     no personally identifiable information is requested from the user. However if the                                     user includes his or her personally identifiable information in the story, it may                                     be posted publicly on the website. Interactive Solutions, EDS, and eDriving, LLC are not responsible for                                     any personally identifiable information you choose to post in this form. To request                                     removal of your personally identifiable information from our public forum, contact                                     us at info@driversed.com . In some cases,                                     we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which                                     case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Registration
In order to use any of our websites you must first enroll in a course. During enrollment                                     you are required to give us your contact information (such as name, address and                                     email address). For traffic school, we require your drivers license number, which                                     is a unique identifier that will enable you to log into our course after the initial                                     enrollment process. We also require personally identifiable information such as                                     the last four digits of your social security number (in Florida and Georgia your                                     full social security number is required), date of birth, height, weight, and eye                                     color. Bank account and routing numbers are collected if you decide to pay by personal                                     check. If you wish to update your account information, please email the appropriate                                     website.
Security
Our websites take every precaution to protect our users' information. When users                                     submit sensitive information through our websites, their information is protected                                     both online and off-line. Sensitive information submitted through our enrollment                                     form is protected using SSL encryption. Our enrollment form displays the lock icon                                     on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet                                     Explorer, indicating a secure page.
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything                                     in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information,                                     not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.                                     Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,                                     our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally                                     identifiable information. Employees have their own user name and password to access                                     student's information in the database. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date                                     on our security and privacy practices. Every year as well as any time new policies                                     are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place                                     on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.                                     Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure                                     environment.

We use two court assigned agents, Coordinated                                     Court Services (CCS) and the National Traffic Safety Administration (NTSA), to print                                     certificates of completion for certain counties in California. Our system only sends                                     information that is required by the court to CCS and the NTSA to enable them to                                     print certificates of completion, such as the student's name, drivers license                                     number, and court docket number. For the States of Virginia and Florida, we have                                     contracted with outside agents in each state to offer customer support and to print                                     traffic school certificates of completion. These agents do not collect any personally                                     identifiable information. They merely access our database to offer customer support                                     to students in the respective states, and to print certificates of completion. They                                     do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary                                     purposes.
