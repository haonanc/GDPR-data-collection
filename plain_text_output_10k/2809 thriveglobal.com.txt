Thrive Global Privacy Policy
Welcome to Thrive Global Holdings Inc. (“Thrive”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). Our mobile application (“App”) helps users (“Users,” “you,” or “your”) take back control of your time by giving you  tools to set boundaries with technology so you can connect more deeply with yourself and others. Our website (“Site”) also allows you to easily access and use content, including features, resources and other information intended to help you change the way you live and work. Collectively, the services we provide through the Site and the App are defined as the “Service(s)”.
This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect through the App and the Site, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices.  This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms and Conditions Agreement, which are available at https://www.thriveglobal.com/thrive/terms .
By providing us with your personal data when using the Services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services.
This Privacy Policy also explains what personal data we collect from Thrive’s enterprise customers (“Customers”) and how we use and share that data.  Where we provide the Services under contract with our Customers, that Customer controls the personal data submitted to the Services.  In this Privacy Policy we refer to the data we process on behalf of Customers as “Service Data”. Our use of Service Data is governed by our contract with the specific Customer and the Customer’s own privacy policies.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of Customers or other third parties. For more information, please see the Service Data section below.
Thrive complies with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“Frameworks”)       as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data       transferred from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. (for these purposes, reference to the EU also       includes the European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Thrive       has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any       conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield       Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Frameworks and       to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/ .

PRIVACY POLICY
OPT OUT
Strictly necessary
We use cookies that are strictly necessary to provide Users with the Services and to use some of their features, such as the ability to log-in and access to secure areas.

Analytics/performance
We use “analytics” cookies that allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Site works, for example by making sure users are finding what they need easily. The collected data provides us only with anonymous traffic statistics (like number of page views, number of visitors, and time spent on each page).  These cookies also may allow us to track how often posts on third party websites, such as social media sites, are clicked on.

Accountability for Onward Transfers. We may be accountable for the Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield that we may transfer to third-party service providers (as described in the “Sharing and Disclosure of Information” section above) if they process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and we are responsible if they do so and for the harm caused.

“ People look for retreats for themselves, in the country, by the coast, or in the hills . . . There is nowhere that a person can find a more peaceful and trouble-free retreat than in his own mind. . . . So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself. ”
— Marcus Aurelius
