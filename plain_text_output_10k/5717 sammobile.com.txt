Additional information
If there are any questions or complaints regarding this Privacy & Cookies Policy you may contact us directly at [email protected] or through one of our preferred contact methods. Please, only use this for questions or complaints and not to request data removal or data takeout, as these are specifically made self-service for easier and faster processing. Emailing instead will delay the process of handling your data removal or data takeout request and will make the process a lot harder and slower for those involved.
