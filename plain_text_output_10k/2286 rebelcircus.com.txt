By using the Services, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, and agree to the RebelCircus Terms of Use, which are incorporated by reference. If you do not agree, please do not access or use the Services.
1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

If you send someone else a communication through the Sites or Apps, such as an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (e.g., name, e-mail address) will be used to facilitate the communication and will not be used for any other marketing purpose, unless such person registers with us or becomes a customer, we obtain consent from such person, or we explicitly say otherwise at the point of collection.

We may also give you the option to link to your Facebook or other social media account through a Site or App. When you do, we may automatically receive certain information about you based on your registration and privacy settings on those third-party services. This may include, but may not be limited to, your name, user name, demographic information, updated address or contact information, location, interests, and publicly-observed data, such as from social media and online activity. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users give us access to their accounts, and information about you (such as the fact that you are “friends”) is otherwise accessible through those accounts.

Please refer to your browser’s or operating system’s website or “Help” section for more information on how to delete and/or disable your browser or operating system from receiving cookies or controlling your tracking preferences.
Our system may not respond to Do Not Track requests or headers from some or all browsers. We may use cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and to link data collected across other computers or devices that you may use.
To learn more about the use of cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and to know your choices with respect to collection and use of the data by these third party tools, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

Opt Out Preferences
We provide our customers with the opportunity to opt out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to placement, processing, fulfillment, or delivery of a product or service. To opt-out of marketing communications, you may use one of these convenient methods:

Additionally, we are not responsible for informing third parties (including without limitation our third-party service providers or partners) with whom we have already shared your personal information of any changes requested pursuant to this section.
Access to Your Information
You can verify, correct, or update certain information associated with your Site or App account. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of this information. If you choose to deactivate your account, we may still retain certain information for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce our Terms of Use or other policies, take actions we deem necessary due to technical and legal requirements, and as dictated by constraints related to the security, integrity, and operation of our Sites and Apps.
5. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS - UPDATING, OBTAINING A COPY, OR DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
If the law grants you such rights, you may ask to access, correct, or delete your personal information that is stored in our systems. You may also ask for our confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data.
Subject to the limitations in law, you may request that we update, correct, or delete inaccurate or outdated information. You may also request that we suspend the use of any personal data whose accuracy you contest while we verify the status of that data.
Subject to law, you may also be entitled to obtain the personal data you directly provided us (excluding data we obtained from other sources) in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and may have the right to transmit the data to another party.
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, contact us at: info@rebelcircus.com . When handling these requests,
 we may ask for additional information to confirm your identity and your request. You must put the statement “Updating my personal information” in the subject field. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information. Non-affiliated third parties are independent from Rebel Circus, and if you wish to receive information about your disclosure choices or stop communications from such third parties, you will need to contact those non-affiliated third parties directly.
6. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND PLUG-INS
The Sites and Apps may have links to third-party websites and mobile applications, which may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the practices of such sites and apps. The Sites and Apps may also offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, which may allow us and/or the social media site to receive data from or about you. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin, such as a Twitter Follow button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personal information to a third party operating a plug-in on the Sites or Apps, then such third party may recognize you on the Sites or Apps. Your use of social network plugins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy, which may be different from ours, so please read those policies carefully to understand their policies and your options. As with linked sites, we have no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plugins, and are not responsible for the practices of such sites.
7. PUBLIC FORUMS
Any information you may disclose on our Sites or Apps, in blogs, on message boards, in chat rooms, or on other public areas on the Sites or Apps or other third-party websites that the Sites or Apps may link to, becomes public information. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas.
8. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Protecting children’s privacy is important to us. We do not direct the Sites or Apps to, nor do we knowingly collect any personal information from, children under the age of thirteen. If Rebel Ciurcus learns that a child under the age of thirteen has provided personally identifiable information to a Site or App, it will use reasonable efforts to remove such information from its files.
9. DATA SECURITY
We have taken certain physical, administrative, and technical steps to safeguard the information we collect from and about our customers and Services users. While we make every effort to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our security measures. When you provide sensitive information (such as credit card information) via the Sites or Apps, we encrypt the transmission of that information using transport layer security technology (TLS).
10. DATA STORAGE
 
11. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.
12. REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, remove, or otherwise revise portions of this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, we will post the change(s) on the Sites and Apps. Your continued use of the Sites and Apps following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.
