Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we link to it from our home page and other pages of our website.
The Information We Collect
This notice applies to the information collected or submitted on the Magazines.com website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register for promotional offers or free magazines. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:
Name
Address
Demographic Information
On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are:
Name
Address
Emails from Magazines.com
As a Magazines.com customer you will receive special offers, coupons, and exclusive gift cards via email. If you prefer not to receive promotional emails from us you can easily manage your email preferences. In every promotional email we send, there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. Click the link, and after your request is processed you will no longer receive promotional emails.
Note: Even if you choose to not receive some marketing emails from us, you will still receive our transactional email, such as messages relating to the status of your order, or information about your account.
The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete the order. It is necessary to furnish this information to our third party fulfillment partners, such as magazine publishers, in order to quickly fulfill your order, as well as in connection with the processing of credit card payments.  For email addresses specifically, Magazines.com does not share this information with other parties, except when you purchase a digital magazine subscription and your email address is required to authenticate that digital subscription with the magazine publisher. Because your information is shared with our third party fulfillment partners, the information is governed by the privacy policies of the recipients of the information. We also use the information to provide you with information about our other products and services and in an effort to provide you with a superior customer experience, including using information to develop personalized shopping experiences and histories for customers in order to customize products, promotions, emails, updates or special offers.
We also employ third parties to perform services or functions on our behalf in order to improve our site, maintain our site and software, for merchandising, marketing and promotional efforts, and for communications or other services. During the purchase process, at the time of checkout we may share your information (other than email addresses) with such service providers or intermediaries to help identify offers for products and services from other parties that may be of interest to you. This information is not further provided to advertisers or other third parties without your consent, and in the event such service providers or intermediaries obtain any personal information during that process, it will not be used by them other than in the performance of their services for us. We may also employ third parties to analyze our sales data or to assist in marketing and personalizing product information.
We seek to ensure that contractors, service providers, and other third parties who work with us to support our business or otherwise make the Magazines.com site available (including the software, applications and services provided on our website) protect the personal information that they store, access or obtain in connection with our services, including, when possible, through contractual obligations to safeguard the confidentiality of such information and use it only for the purposes for which it is disclosed to, or accessed by, them.
Disclosure to Other Third Parties
It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from governmental authorities - for Magazines.com to disclose certain of the information you have provided us to applicable third parties. We may also disclose this information if we determine that for purposes of law enforcement or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose this information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms of service or protect our operations or users. Additionally, we may share personal information with our subsidiaries and affiliated entities, primarily for business and operational purposes.  We reserve the right to disclose and transfer all information related to Magazines.com, including personal information we collect to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of our website or one of our databases or in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale of Magazines.com.
Cookies
Cookies are small files downloaded to your computer to record movements within websites. We use cookies for website optimization reasons, but do not use cookies to collect any personal information. We also use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on other websites. To opt-out of our data collection for targeted advertising on other sites, click here to Opt Out Now .
Tracking
We do use tracking software to observe user traffic patterns throughout our site. But we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Tracking information is used only to determine which areas of our site users like and don't like, and how well each page performs on behalf of our guests. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We also monitor search terms and titles entered at our site as a means of knowing what interests our customers; however, we do not track which terms a particular user enters.
Security
When you place orders, we provide the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. And all customer data we receive is protected against unauthorized access. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other personal information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
Visitors from Outside of the United States
Magazines.com is hosted in the United States.  If you are visiting this service from outside the US, your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the US in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable US laws.  Please note that data protection and other applicable laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those laws or regulations in your country or may otherwise differ from the data protection or consumer protection laws in your country.
Children Under the Age of 13
We do not knowingly collect information about or from children under 13 without parental consent, nor do we or any of our third parties knowingly direct any solicitations or advertisements to children under 13. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information online without parental consent, we will take reasonable measures to delete the information promptly and not use such information for any purpose, except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

Magazines.com reserves the right to modify or amend this privacy policy at any time. It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page, and the date this policy was last revised is identified at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
