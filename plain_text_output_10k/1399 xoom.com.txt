We are committed to protecting our customers' privacy and security.

Certain sections may apply differently to residents of different jurisdictions.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this for fraud prevention, to improve our Service, and to improve our marketing, analytics, or website functionality;
Recordings of your communications with our Customer Service department, including telephone calls and electronic communications; and
Type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier.
We do not ask you for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile applications or Service.

You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings or through the mobile application settings.
We and our third-party service providers, including our marketing partners and analytics providers, may also use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts and similar technology ("Cookies").

We do not have access or control over these Cookies. In addition, some of our third party advertising vendors or partners show our ads on sites across the Internet.
