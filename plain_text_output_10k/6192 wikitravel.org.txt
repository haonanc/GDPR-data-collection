Wikitravel Shared:Privacy policy
From Wikitravel Shared
Many Wikitravellers -- but by no means all! -- are experienced Internet users who value their privacy. The following policy tries to balance the needs of Wikitravellers with the needs of the Wikitravel community at large.
Wikitraveller user information will not be sold for any reason. Your user information will not be sold to marketing companies or other groups who want to bother you. Wikitravellers get enough unsolicited bulk email as it is; we're not going to go out of our way to get more.
You may be sent email by other Wikitravellers. Each user page contains a link to email the user . Your email address will not be exposed to other users, but they will be able to send you email through the Web form. Additionally, if you email another user, your email address will be used in the From field; sending email through Wikitravel is not anonymous. You can disable email from other users on your preferences page.
You may be sent email by Wikitravel administrators even if you disabled email from other users. In extreme circumstances, Wikitravel administrators may contact you directly through email. This would be only for extraordinary situations.
You may be sent mass email by Wikitravel administrators. On very rare occasions, it may be necessary for Wikitravel administrators to send out a mass email to all Wikitravel users. Again, this would be for extraordinary situations -- such as spectacular changes in copyright policy -- and will not be used for marketing, promotions, or other "newsletter" types of mailing. Normal announcements and news will go in the Logbook .
Wikitraveller user information will be transferred on demand to law enforcement officials or under court order. In general, your Wikitravel identity will not be protected in case of legal investigation. Wikitravel is not some kind of digital snitch service, and we won't go out of our way to rat you out to the authorities, but we do need to protect the community first.
IP addresses are logged. The MediaWiki software used by Wikitravel logs the IP address of anonymous users. This is mostly to give those users some identity, but in case of legal hassle, IP address log information will be turned over to courts or law enforcement officials.
Your "real name" will be used for attribution. At the bottom of each page is an attribution block showing who worked on the page. This is a feature; we're giving you credit for the work that you do. You don't have to provide a real name to Wikitravel if you don't want; just don't fill out the "real name" field when signing up, or in the preferences list.
Your username or IP address is associated with changes. When you create and edit an article, your username will be associated with that change. This is required by our copyleft ; we need to have some identifier to attribute your work to.
User pages are published, copyleft works. Your user page is released under the same copyleft license as any other part of Wikitravel. Don't put personal information there that you would feel uncomfortable having appear on other Web sites, in books, projected onto the sides of buildings, or whatever.
Talk pages are published, copyleft works. Similarly, your comments on talk pages are also copyleft, and subject to the same rules for distribution as any other page.
