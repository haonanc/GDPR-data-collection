We also may receive information (but not payment card information) concerning your transactions with some of our business partners (such as floral, memorial, or insurance providers) when those transactions are related to merchandise or services that we have been asked to provide for you.
Many of our Sites include links to websites operated by third-party providers of floral arrangements and delivery services (“Third-Party Floral Sites”). Information provided on Third-Party Floral Sites is governed by the third-party’s privacy policy, not this Policy.
In some instances, we operate a floral arrangement and delivery service websites (“Our Floral Sites”) using the software or services of a third-party service provider. In connection with orders placed on Our Floral Sites, we collect information and provide it to our service provider and a local florist to facilitate the provision of goods or services you request. For example, if you place a floral order through Our Floral Sites, we may ask that you provide information related to the destination of the delivery, any special message to accompany the delivery, any special instructions for the delivery, the purpose of the delivery, information related to service issues in connection with the delivery, and payment card information. We do not store your payment card information other than a redacted credit card number, which is provided to the local florist. Instead, payment card information is encrypted and forwarded to our service provider for secure handling by its payment processor. We may also provide Internet Protocol (“IP”) address information to our service provider for fraud detection purposes.

Online tracking/do-not-track signals
Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not track your activity across third-party websites, and we do not knowingly allow other parties to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites when you use our Site.
Currently, various Internet browsers offer a “Do-Not-Track” option that uses a header to indicate a Do-Not-Track preference on the browser.

How we use personal information
We use personal information to provide you with quality services, to carry out requested transactions, and to improve our Site and our service and merchandise offerings. We may use some of the information that we collect concerning you in order to present you with information concerning services or merchandise that may be of interest, and we may share that information within our family of affiliates. For example, we may tailor our marketing efforts based on the types of services and merchandise you purchase, the services and merchandise in which you demonstrate an interest, and your use of our Site. In some instances, we may share limited personal information with third-party online floral and memorial websites in connection with our funeral, cremation or other time-of-death services, and when you navigate to those third-party websites from our Site. In addition, we may retain and use communications, transaction details, your IP address and identifying information in order to maintain audit trails for security purposes.
We also provide personal information to third-party providers of goods and services who assist us in providing services or merchandise to you. We require that those providers use personal information only for that purpose, and we also require assurances that they will appropriately protect personal information entrusted to them. We may also share personal contact information with companies that are not affiliates of SCI (e.g., floral providers or companies in the senior living industry) when we believe you may be interested in their products or services, so that those companies can market their own products and services to you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not share personal information about California or Vermont residents except as permitted by law.
Protecting personal information
We are committed to maintaining the security of personal information. We employ reasonable security measures to secure and protect the information we receive. Please remember, though, that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
Disclosure policy
We disclose personal information as necessary to operate our business, such as in connection with providing services to you or processing your transactions. We also may disclose information concerning you if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to protect and defend our rights or property, or those of others. In addition, we may share anonymous information aggregated to reflect Site traffic volume, average time spent on a Site, pages viewed and other such parameters with our business partners, advertisers, consultants or other persons or entities for any legitimate business purpose. We may share information with our affiliates and with non-affiliates as described under “How We Use Personal Information” above.
Sales, mergers and acquisitions
In the event of a sale or other transfer of ownership of one or more funeral home or cemetery locations or other business units to a third party (whether by private sale, through operation of law, as part of a divestiture plan or otherwise), we will provide personal information and transaction history associated with each such business unit to the persons and/or entities assuming control of such business unit.
Public disclosure using non-restricted services
As stated above, when you post any information or other content to an online obituary, guestbook or memorial using our Site, such information and/or other content is viewable by the public, and the security and other protective provisions of this Privacy Policy do not apply. Our Sites make online and voice-recorded Guest Books, Death Notices, Obituaries, Biographies, Photo Galleries, Moving Memories®, other online memorials, location of funeral and cemetery services, and other postings to our non-restricted services available for viewing by all our visitors unless the sponsor or host of a service selects a privacy setting that restricts public access (available as an option only on certain services). Any information or other content disclosed on a non-restricted service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without your or our knowledge. Also, please keep in mind that the posting of your user ID or alias in connection with public disclosures may result in the transmission of unsolicited messages to you from persons and entities over which we have no control. Please exercise caution and good judgment when disclosing any personal information in any non-restricted service. Note that we cannot be responsible for any online postings by a family member, friend, acquaintance or other person or entity outside of our control. Such activities and the associated postings are also outside the scope of this Policy.
Links
The Site may contain links to other websites, and other websites may link to this Site. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. Whenever you visit another website—via a link from this Site or otherwise—you should review the privacy policy of that other website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information provided or obtained on our Site.
No use by children under the age of 18
The Site is not intended for use by children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you may not use our Sites. If a parent or legal guardian posts an entry on behalf of a child under the age of 18 on an online guestbook or other section of the Site, the parent or legal guardian must indicate that such entry is being made on behalf of the child by the parent or legal guardian. Caution and good judgment should be used in connection with any information provided concerning the child. If we believe that any information has been posted by a child under the age of 18, we will promptly delete that information. Parents may contact us using the methods set forth below to request that information concerning their child be removed from our Site.
