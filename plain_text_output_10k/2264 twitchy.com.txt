WHAT INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT
In connection with your use of twitchy.com, you may submit and we will then collect different types of personally identifiable information including but not limited to your name and e-mail address. We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit our web Sites or use our applications, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using, your IP Address and your Internet service provider, platform type, referring and exit Sites, domain names, URLs, and location-based information. If you provide information about yourself to us in an email, text message, Twitter direct message, or some other form of communication, we may retain that information.
HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION
We may use the information you provide to offer products, programs or services that may be of interest to you. We do not share your personal information with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes.
If you choose to submit content to our site (such as in an email or in comments), we may publish your name, screen name, and other information you have provided to us. The information we collect in connection with twitchy.com viewer comments is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in our site. Furthermore, if you submit comments, we may make such content available to other web sites and networks.
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design, content and viewer experience of twitchy.com by storing, tracking, and analyzing viewer preferences and trends and web traffic on twitchy.com. We also may use this information to analyze site usage.
We may use and share with third parties certain technical information (including IP addresses) or aggregated information to show general demographic and preference information and viewer patterns among twitchy.com readers. We may also allow advertisers to collect technical or aggregated information, which they may share with us, with tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected may be used to offer you targeted ad-selection and delivery in order to personalize your viewer experience by ensuring that advertisements for products and services you see will appeal to you, a practice known as behavioral advertising, and to undertake web analytics (i.e. to analyze traffic and other end user activity to improve your experience).
We may engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage, management and analysis, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.
We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information to a law enforcement agency in response to a law enforcement agency’s request or if we believe it is necessary or appropriate to provide such information.
We retain the right to publish information about you on our website or elsewhere if we consider such information to be newsworthy. If you send us an email or Direct Message, we may publish it (including your name, email address, Twitter handle, and other information about you).  If you request that an email or Direct Message not be published, we may or may not honor your request, at our sole discretion.
Please note that if Twitchy or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or lines of business is sold or otherwise disposed of, including through merger of, consolidation or sale of assets, or in the unlikely event that Twitchy goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, the relevant customer database, including personally identifiable information we may possess about you, may, in whole or in part, be sold, disposed of, transferred or otherwise disclosed as part of that transaction and you acknowledge that the acquirer of Twitchy may continue to use your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Twitchy.com may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. You should consult the other sites’ privacy policies, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

COOKIES
To enhance your online experience we use cookies. Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering in connection with twitchy.com. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.
We use cookies to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings and advertisements. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at twitchy.com (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to the site) and to save your password in password-protected areas. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs or services. Similarly, as part of an arrangement with our business partners (including those who present or serve the advertisements that you see on our web Sites) we may also access cookies placed by others and allow others to access certain cookies placed by us.
Twitchy.com  may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider. The ad service provider may place or utilize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to the site, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. We are not responsible for the collection of these cookies and are not responsible for the actions of the ad service providers. We do not sponsor, endorse or guarantee any products or services advertised by third parties on twitchy.com.
We may also use small pieces of code such as “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting Site views, promotion views or advertising responses. These “web beacons” may be used to deliver cookies that conform to our cookie policy.
You may set your Web browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block cookies altogether. In order to adjust your browser settings or preferences you should review the “Help” or “Internet Options” menu in your browser’s tool bar.”
SECURITY
We use commercially reasonable measures to put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security and correctly use the information we collect. Your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or in part on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and may be stored on equipment or in facilities leased or licensed from third parties. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although we take such measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.
