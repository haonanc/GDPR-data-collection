These companies need information about you to perform their service function (such as to process and fulfill your order, verify your credit card information, and to protect you from fraud). We also share your information with specially chosen companies that help us with marketing functions (such as manage our Internet business, maintain and manage our customer information, as well as market our products and services).

"Cookies" are small text files that are transferred from websites to your computer's hard drive that may serve a variety of purposes (web beacons, Flash cookies and other similar technologies may also be used for these purposes).

If you wish, you can visit our website without cookies by turning them off in your Internet or mobile browser, but then certain features, including adding items to a shopping cart, making a purchase, or using a registry, will not be available. We may use “pixel tags” (e.g. web beacons or similar technologies) that allow us to know if a particular web page was visited, an email opened, links in the email utilized, transactions from online purchases, and whether a particular advertisement or email is effective. To support this interest based advertising solution, we, and companies who we have contracted with, may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our and other websites.

Please keep in mind that Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At this time, the World Web Consortium has not yet established universal standards for recognizable Do Not Track Signals and therefore, Burlington Stores, Inc. does not recognize Do Not Track for all technologies. If and when a standard is set, we may revisit this policy.
Is our hope that you find the display of advertising to you based on your non-personally identifying browsing interests valuable. However, if you would prefer not to participate in the services offered through these solutions, you can always opt-out of this activity by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .

Browser settings, including do not track signals and other mechanisms, will not affect data collection and not constitute an opt-out of advertising-related cookies, personalized third-party advertising or promotional messages from Burlington Stores, Inc.; you must use the opt-out choice described herein in order to opt out from such promotional messages.
