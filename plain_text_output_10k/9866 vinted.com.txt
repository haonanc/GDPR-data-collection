Vinted Inc. (“Vinted”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. We want to share with you how we treat personal information about you that we receive in connection with your use of our website and mobile applications (collectively, the “Site”).
Also, please bear in mind that your use of this Site is governed by the Terms and Conditions posted on the Site. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms and Conditions. As noted in those Terms and Conditions, although we operate internationally, Vinted Inc. is a company organized under the laws of Delaware.
Information We Collect
Information You Provide
We collect your personal information if you voluntarily submit the information to us for such purposes as registering for the use of certain services, completion of surveys, submitting applications for employment, product or service purchases, or requests for information or services. For example, sections of this Site (including certain restricted portions) may allow you to submit personal information (referred to for convenience as “Registration Pages”), including your name, address, email address, phone number(s), account information and any other information that you decide to provide us with, either directly or via third-party services (for example, Facebook Connect). To protect your security and privacy, we require that you (as opposed to a third party on your behalf) enter the personal information that we collect and that the information be current, although Vinted disclaims any legal duty to verify the accuracy of any personal data that you provide to Vinted.
Location Information
You may provide information about your location, including your address, to us on our Site’s Registration Pages. If you post items for sale, we may use that information to tell other users, including potential buyers, your approximate distance away from them (but not your specific address). Similarly, when you review items for sale, we may use information that you have provided to us to give you an approximate distance between you and the seller. We may also collect and use current location information from your mobile device to do the same, but will ask you to allow us to collect such information, before we do so.
Automated Information Collection
We may automatically collect certain information when you visit our Site, such as your IP address; details about your browser, operating system and device/hardware; your location, if available; the URL that referred you to our website; your activities on our Site; and other logging information, including the date and time of your visit. We may use a variety of technologies for such data collection, including web logs, web beacons, clear GIFs, cookies and others.
Use of Cookies and Web Beacons
Like many websites, our Site uses “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer or mobile device’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Vinted Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site and the Site’s functionality may be limited. Please note that linked third-party websites may also use cookies. We cannot control the use of cookies by these third-party websites. For example, when you link from this Site to a third-party website, that website may have the ability to recognize that you have come from our Website by using cookies. If you have any questions about how third-party websites use cookies, you should contact such third parties directly. We may also employ software technology known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs” which helps us keep track of what content on our Site is effective. Web beacons are small graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review, so they are not stored on your hard drive. The web beacons we use do not track or collect any personally identifiable information about you and they are in no way linked to your personally identifiable information.
Analytics Services, Targeted Ads & Do-Not-Track
We may also use third-party analytics services, including Google Analytics, and these services may track details about your online activities over time and across different websites, in addition to our Site. These services help us to improve our Site and operations. These services may also allow others to provide you with targeted ads or content that you may be interested in based on your online activities. You can learn more about Google Analytics and your choices here . If you would like to learn more about targeted ads and consumer choice, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.networkadvertising.org or www.aboutads.info/choices. 
We do not respond to, or take any specific action in connection with the receipt of, Do-Not-Track signals or other similar mechanisms regarding the collection of information about an individual’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.
Accessing & Updating Your Information
You are free to access the personal information we have on file by contacting our Customer Service department using our contact form . In addition, at any time you can request that we modify or delete your personal information by contacting the team through our contact forum with the words “UPDATE MY INFORMATION” in body of your message. Please be aware that, to protect your security and privacy, Vinted may take reasonable steps to verify your identity prior to making changes to your personal information.

Links to Other Sites and Site Accounts
For your convenience, the Vinted Site may from time to time include links to third-party websites and online services whose information practices may be different than ours.

Site Accounts are pages on certain websites (for example, the Vinted page on Facebook), where the same information, as in our Site, is provided, because Vinted is the editor of both our Site and the Site Accounts. The Terms and Conditions, this Privacy Policy and other applicable rules published on our Site are binding on and apply to the Users and Visitors of Site Accounts with respect to Vinted. Users and Visitors should carefully read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of websites that host these Site Accounts which may also apply and over which Vinted has no control.

Security of Information and Disclosures

Vinted will, to the extent possible, control your personal information, and, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties. Although we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information, if required by law, we reserve the right to disclose such information without first obtaining your consent.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
The Site and Services may change from time to time. As a result, it may be necessary for Vinted to make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.
