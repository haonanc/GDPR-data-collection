who provide services to us so that they can provide the services we request. This might include IT service providers who support our IT systems, for example;
6.2.2
 
 
if you have given us your Twitter username we may share tweets posted by you and your followers to third parties and, while we will not disclose your Twitter handle, it may be that either (a) information contained within those feeds alone could identify you or a third party or (b) those tweets could be linked with other information the third party already holds which then enables them to identify you or someone else; or
we may exchange what we consider to be anonymous or pseudonymised information about our panellists with third parties who will use it for analysis purposes, to enhance their own databases, to model audiences and track the efficiency of campaigns, and to gain an insight into behaviours so that they can develop strategies which add value to their, or their clients’ businesses. For this purpose, we may also collect anonymised information from third parties which we can use to identify you. As our clients and, in turn their clients, will have their own databases and other sources of information, it may be that they could link the anonymous information we provide with information they already have and therefore identify you; or
we may provide limited personal details to trusted third party data processors for the purposes of combining our data with other third party data sources. The final combined data set will be anonymised and non-attributable.
6.2.3
if we sell or buy any business or assets, (as we may share your data with the prospective seller or buyer);
