Privacy & Security Policy
The Buckle, Inc. cares about the privacy of our Guests. Our goal is to provide the best shopping experience possible for our Guests, and we strive to achieve that goal through our Internet shopping experience. Buckle.com collects client information to enhance your shopping experience.
General Browsing
Buckle.com gathers navigational information about where our visitors go on our web site and information about the technical efficiencies of our web site and services (i.e. time to connect to our web site, time to download pages). This information allows us to see which areas of Buckle.com are most visited and helps us to better understand our Guests’ experience at Buckle.com. This helps us to improve the quality of our visitors’ online shopping experiences by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. In the process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding a visitor’s use of our web site (such as the time of a visitor’s last visit to a page on our web site).
If you cancel an order or do not complete an order, we may collect and use any email address or other information that you have entered as we would collect and use it if you had completed an order. For example, if you shop Buckle.com and leave the site without completing your order, we may follow up through email with a reminder.
Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information
We collect information from you, which you provide to us at this web site when you establish or update an account, enter a sweepstakes, participate in a survey, shop online or create or send a wish list. Categories of information collected include name, address, email address, recipient’s email address, telephone number, credit card information and messages you create. This information is used to enable Buckle.com to deliver products that you have ordered, to fulfill requests that you have created, to contact you or the recipient(s) in the event of order or delivery difficulties, for verification, to respond to your inquiries and to deliver services and information about our products or web site to you. We use third parties to help us provide services, such as processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, maintaining our database, administering and locating emails, and assisting in administering sweepstakes.
If you opt into our email list the information you provide (for example, name, email address, country, gender, and age certification) will be added to a database. The Buckle, Inc. may use that information for our own internal marketing purposes. We may request information from you about your fashion tastes, your hobbies or your music interests. This information will be collected from you directly and openly. Using the information you give us, we may contact you with information or special offers. We will not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. The Buckle, Inc. does not sell or disclose the personal information of any of our guests to outside third parties without the guest's consent.
Buckle.com continually strives to maintain compliance with legal regulations. If we become aware of or have a good faith belief that we must disclose information about you in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity, we will disclose specific information about you to the appropriate legal authorities in order to protect the users of our Web site, the site, and/or the public.

According to the FTC, this prescreening process does not have a negative effect on your credit report or credit score. If you prefer not to receive prescreened credit offers from Buckle and other companies, you may call 1-888-5-OPTOUT or visit www.optoutprecreen.com to limit access to your credit report information. According to the FTC, requests to opt out are processed within five days, but it may take up to 60 days before you stop receiving prescreened offers.

In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not gather or use personal information from any Guest who indicates they are less than 13 years of age (or less than 18 years of age for residents of the state of Maine). A parent or guardian must assist any pre-teen Guest in any sweepstakes or ordering activity online with Buckle.com.

If you register or purchase product through Buckle.com, we may associate navigational information from your previous browsing visits with the personal information you provide. In addition, we carefully select third party advertising companies and allow them to collect non-personally identifiable information by placing cookies when you choose to visit Buckle.com. This information is used to report marketing program effectiveness directly back to the Buckle, Inc. This information is used in aggregate form and is not in any way personally identifiable. We have carefully selected a company, Coremetrics, which will assist us in better understanding your use of our site.

Buckle.com’s Email List
Joining Buckle.com’s email list allows you to receive exclusive information about special offers, media events, new products and much more. If you’re not already registered, simply complete our sign-up form to receive these special messages. You may also opt-in to our email database through our physical stores at the cash register. Those names are electronically added in batch to our email database weekly. If you have opted-out of our email database in the past but have more recently opted back into our email database through the store register, we will renew your subscription at that time. If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of Buckle.com’s email messages, please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each email message. This will not prevent you from receiving email communications relating to any online order you place at Buckle.com, requests to participate in surveys about our products or other operational email communications.
Buckle.com will never ask you through email to provide personal information including credit card numbers, passwords, mother’s maiden name, bank account numbers, ATM pass codes or social security numbers. The best way to protect yourself from phishing scams is for you to avoid supplying personal information to any email request. If you believe the request might be legitimate, please call the company’s customer service department to verify this before providing any information, but do not use phone numbers contained in the email (if any are included).

Should there be a material change in the categories of information collected at Buckle.com or a material change in how we use information collected at Buckle.com (whether a deletion or addition), for a thirty day period after the change we will note deletions with a strike-out and additions in italic type. Further, for this same period we will note [Revised] at the end of the revised sentence or sentences and update the effective date at the bottom of the Privacy & Security Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please visit our site often for this and other important announcements about Buckle.com. If you have submitted your email address to us for email contact, we will notify you should our policy change. You will then have an opportunity to opt-out of any new use of your information.
Security Statement
We have made every effort to ensure that the information transmitted to us online is secure through the use of a secure server. With respect to online sales, the person whose name appears on the card must be the one who places the order. The Buckle uses secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption for securing communications and transactions across the Internet. The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications “pip” between the purchaser and our web entity. Data transmitted over an SSL connection can not be tampered with or forged without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the tampering. A key or padlock icon in the lower corner of the browser window identifies the security mode of a browser. When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key looks broken or the padlock looks open. Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is in “secure” mode. SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption. In addition, it is our policy not to send your credit card number via email. In fact, this is a practice we recommend you adopt in all of your internet activities.
While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible. This Privacy & Security Policy supersedes all prior policies and is effective July 1, 2013.
This is version 3 , from 4 years ago.
