A.   WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?
In order to provide you with products of interest to you and to continually improve your shopping experience on Lumens.com, we collect information about our Customers in a variety of ways. In some cases, Lumens.com asks Customers directly for information in order for them to purchase products or use our services, and, in other cases, information is collected automatically as Customers are using the Lumens.com Web site. You may choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to purchase products or take advantage of the features we offer. Lumens.com is the sole owner of information collected on the Lumens.com Web site. The following is a summary of the kinds of information Lumens.com collects:
1. Active Collection.
Lumens.com collects certain information either voluntarily or as required in order to register with Lumens.com or use certain Lumens.com services or features. This type of information includes:
Order form. Contact information, such as name, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number.
Shipping or transaction information, such as billing address and financial information (credit card number and expiration date) if you choose to purchase products offered for sale on the Lumens.com Web site. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the Customer.
Demographic information such as zip code.
Information you enter in forms and optional surveys or contests, such as name and e-mail address.
Information provided in connection with discussions on bulletin boards, in chat rooms, and in messaging or other interactive services.
Information provided in e-mail requests and communications.
Information from other sources. In order to personalize our service by providing better product recommendations or special offers we may think will interest you, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. In addition, we may acquire customer names, e-mail addresses and mailing addresses for select mailings from third parties.
2. Passive Collection
Some information is collected automatically while you are using the Lumens.com Web site. It is important to note that Lumens.com must store this information in order to ensure its Customers receive optimal service while using Lumens.com services. This type of information includes:
a. Log Files: Log files information, such as IP addresses, browser type, domain names, number of page views, login frequency, page or section accesses. Log files are used to track member usage and engagement and to gauge the effectiveness of our different services. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Lumens.com Web site.
b. Cookies: Lumens.com uses cookies, which are electronic pieces of information stored on your computer, to allow us to recognize you when you return to our site and to provide you with customized services and information. Although we do not store personal information in cookies, we do tie cookies to customer member ID, which is then used to pull personal information out of the database for identification purposes. Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can be accessed only when you enter your name and password.
Lumens.com also uses Third Parties to provide services to you on behalf of Lumens.com, and in doing so they must set cookies on the site. For example, when you use the Live Chat customer service function on our site, The Third Party who allows us to bring this service to you sets a cookie so we can tell what pages of the site you have accessed in order to better respond to your question. If you reject this cookie, you cannot use Live Chat. Also, we use a Third Party to provide web analytic services which allows Lumens.com to track website usage statistics and checkout information. Such Third Party Cookies are used to:
Store session state information
Protect Web site security and login time-outs
For information on how to have your browser disable cookies or provide a warning before accepting a cookie, please refer to the cookie options in your browser's Options or Preferences menu.
c. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs). We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to Customers' personally identifiable information. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
Also, clear gifs, which may be set by a third party, are used on pages to track sales, which may result from our Internet advertising campaigns and banner advertisements appearing on other web sites. In order to track the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, aggregate data pertaining to the dollar amount spent, items purchased, and campaign the customer responded to, is sent to third party servers for the purpose of tracking which sales resulted from specific advertising campaigns and to track conversion sales coming from banner advertisements. No individually identifiable data is sent to third party servers, only data that reflects that a sale occurred. If Customers would like to opt-out of these e-mails, they should see the Opt-out section.
B.   HOW DOES LUMENS.COM USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED?
Lumens.com endeavors to strictly adhere to state, local and federal laws regarding the preservation and archiving of information collected. In addition to the uses described elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, Lumens.com may use the information you provide in the following ways:
To contact you about our products and services or about your use of our Web site. For example, Customers will receive a welcome e-mail, e-mail newsletters, and customized content, and they may receive an update when Lumens.com has new product features or enhancements or other news to relay to our Customers.

1. Identification and Authentication

We do not grant general access to data within Lumens.com and, except as set forth in this Privacy Statement, access to data is not granted to parties outside Lumens.com. We also verify the identity of the persons accessing the data by using a login name and password. Passwords are required to be six characters and include a non-alphabetic character.

We implement full database backups by our certified Database Administrator to establish data consistency and integrity. We also grant Customers access to their information in order to verify that the data is still accurate and has not been modified or corrupted.
Data are stored on contracted third party secure server and backed up. Such data are stored to the extent required by state, federal and local laws.

F.   LINKING
Lumens.com may offer links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Lumens.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such linked sites, including sites of our partners.

G.   UNSOLICITED E-MAIL (SPAM)
Your privacy is very important to us. Be assured that, in accordance with this privacy policy, we do not sell or distribute our customer list to third parties. You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can sometimes "harvest" your e-mail address directly from your computer or another person's address book or even obtain your e-mail address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail traffic for e-mail addresses. If you opt out of receiving e-mail advertisements from Lumens.com, we may share that information with third parties in order to instruct them not to send advertisements on our behalf to you. If Lumens.com shares opt out information with a third party, we will direct such third party to use this information solely for the purpose of eliminating potential recipients from any e-mails they send out on our behalf.

The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (zip code) or your name and e-mail address.
