FDA LEGAL DISCLAIMER: The statements made on this website [sixpackabs.com] have not been        evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration. The FDA only evaluates foods and drugs, not supplements and fitness programs like these products. These products are not intended to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure any disease.
FTC LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Results are atypical, and your results may vary. Testimonials are not purported to be typical results, and your            weight loss, if any, may vary. Please see our full FTC Legal Disclaimer for a comprehensive disclaimer of risks of use, typical results,            testimonials, and other legal items. **CLICK HERE TO READ FULL DISCLAIMER AND TERMS**
GENERALLY EXPECTED RESULTS FROM OUR SIXPACK ABS AND OTHER PRODUCTS: Although our products are intended to be fully implemented, and we work hard to ensure it's easy to                do so, the typical user of virtually all education products treats them in much the same way they                treat a book.  The vast majority read or skim through it once, then do not implement the program or                take any recommended action based. The results of our exercise methodology are intangible, and not                measured in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind.  And                even when consumers implement our product in full, more often than not they do not report increases in                fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or other positive results of any kind.  Reports of specific                fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or any positive results of any kind should therefore be                understood as the exception rather than the rule.  Consumers who use our products can generally expect               not to see any increase in fat loss, muscle gain, abdominal definition, or positive results of any kind. It is                entirely possible you will gain fat, lose muscle, lose abdominal definition, and experience other negative                outcomes as a result of the advice contained in our products.
TESTIMONIALS DISCLAIMER: Testimonials found at sixpackabs.com and/or from Mike Chang Fitness are unverified                results that have been forwarded to us by users of the Six Pack Shortcuts program, and may not reflect                the typical purchaser's experience (as are described above,) may not apply to the average person and                are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. If we                have disclosed typical results based on information provided to us by a manufacturer or other                reputable third party source, you should presume that the typical results as stated are more reliable than                the testimonials and other examples found at sixpackshortcuts.com and/or from SPS. However, you should always                perform due diligence and not take such results at face value. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions                in typical results information supplied to us by manufacturers or other reputable third parties. If a product                or service is new, you understand that it may not have been available for purchase long enough to provide an                accurate results history. Again, it is possible that even with perfect use of the program, you will not achieve                the results described in testimonials. They are meant to be a showcase of the best results the program                has produced, and should not be taken as the results a typical user will get.
