Privacy Policy
PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES PERIODICALLY AND IS EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 25, 2018.
Digital First Media (“Digital First Media,” “us,” or “we”) is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to explain the type of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect on web sites including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web owned by the Digital First Media, such as www.digitalfirstmedia.com (each, a “Web Site”), and our mobile application (the “Application,” together with Web Site, the “Platform”) and how we use Personal Information. As we update and expand our Platform and services, our Policy may change so check back to this page from time to time.
Our Policy applies to Personal Information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, through our Platform, or in other ways such as by phone, by mail, or through other offline and print media. This Policy does not apply to Personal Information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Platform or Web Site to which this Policy is linked.
Types of Information We Collect
In order to make your visits to our Platform and use of the services available on or through our Platform as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. “Personal Information” is information that allows someone to identify or contact you.

For example, non-user specific aggregated data such as information about traffic patterns on the Web Sites.

Such Personal Information may be collected, for example, when you submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Platform, send us an e-mail, sign up for an email newsletter or mobile alerts, or in any other way submit information to us via our Platform.
You may be able to send products, services, or information to others through our Platform by clicking on an “E-mail to Friend” or similar button on our Platform or in an e-mail that we have sent you.

Such Personal Information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.
