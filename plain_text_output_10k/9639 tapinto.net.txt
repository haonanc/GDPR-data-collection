For visitors, we've structured the Site so that, in general, you can visit us on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.
If and when you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your relationship with TAP.
What information do we collect?
When you sign up for TAP’s services and/or make a donation, you provide us with both contact and/or payment information. Contact information typically includes your name, address, email address and phone number. Payment information typically includes your credit card number.
We manage information with regard to your account status, choice of services, and customer logs. In addition, we may store customers' electronic mail and other communications as a necessary incident to the transmission and delivery of those communications.
How do we use this information?
We use the contact information you provide us to provide or enhance our service to you. We create and maintain other information such as customer account status, choice of services, and customer logs in the normal course of providing service. TAP may share customer information with selected partners and/or third parties, for example, to provide you with information about products or services which might be of interest to you or to enable you to take advantage of special partner programs. You may instruct us at any time not to share your personal information with third parties by sending us an email message at  contact@tapinto.net .
We will not disclose a customer's personal information unless we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of TAP, our customers, or others, or where TAP has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure.
TAP also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that TAP stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which TAP will disclose such electronic customer communications are when:
It helps us to provide service to the customer;
It is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of TAP or its users;
It is required to cooperate with interception orders, warrants, or other legal process that TAP determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable; or
It is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by TAP and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.
TAP retains the right to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. TAP reserves the right, however, to review, delete or block access to communications that may harm TAP, its customers or third parties. The grounds on which TAP may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of the Site's Terms and Conditions.
