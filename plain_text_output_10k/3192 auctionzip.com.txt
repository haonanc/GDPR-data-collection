AuctionZip, LLC ("AuctionZip") is a Delaware Limited    Liability Company based in Boston, Massachusetts.    AuctionZip provides database and software services to parties    who participate in, or have an interest in the antiques, art,    and traditional auction markets.
Our policies have been developed with the recognition that    Internet technologies and underlying business models are    rapidly evolving. Accordingly, our policies are subject to    change. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If the    changes represent a material departure from our current    practices with respect to the use of personal information,    the changes will be posted on this page thirty days prior to    taking effect, and registered users will be notified as    appropriate.
As a condition of using AuctionZip.com, users must confirm    their adult status. In accordance with the Children's    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), AuctionZip.com does    not collect or store any personal information, even in    aggregate, about children under the age of 13.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you    understand our online privacy practices regarding:
1) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
2) HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED
3) HOW YOU CAN CORRECT INFORMATION
4) OUR E-MAIL POLICIES
6) HOW TO CONTACT US
1) INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
The information we gather on our site falls into two    categories: (1) tracking information collected as you    navigate through our site, and (2) personal information you    supply when you register or subscribe:
Tracking Information
Tracking information is collected and stored whenever a    request is made for any page or image on our servers. This    information can be analyzed and presented in the aggregate or    organized by user sessions. We use it for analysis and    reporting on site activity. For example, we may want to know    how long the average user spends on our site, or which pages    or features get the most attention.
Personally Identifiable Information
To use certain features on our site, we ask you to register    and subscribe. When you register, we collect personally    identifiable information about you such as your name, mailing    address, e-mail address, telephone number, user name,    password, and other information about your interest in our    site and services. In addition, when you subscribe, we    collect credit card details necessary for our billing    process.
At present, personally identifiable information about users    is collected only through site pages or forms submitted by    users themselves. When personally identifiable information is    collected, you will know because you will have to fill out    one of these forms.
A Note on Cookies
A "cookie" is a small amount of data that is sent to your    browser from a web server and is sometimes stored on your    computer's hard drive, although not always. Our cookies    contain unique numbers that allow our site to recognize your    computer as you move about our site during a session or    period of use. As an example benefit of cookies, you only    need to sign-in once at the start of a session; after that,    we recognize you as a subscriber.
The help function on most browsers contains information on    how to set your browser to notify you before accepting    cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't    accept cookies, you won't be able to use any feature that    requires registration or subscription.
2) HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED
AuctionZip uses personally identifiable information in a    limited number of ways, in general falling into the following    categories:
Usage Tracking for Business Development and    Management
Our primary business is conducted entirely online. As such,    our success will depend on our ability to gauge popularity of    one feature or product offering over another, or on our    ability to understand how people use our products. Tracking    and aggregating usage information will allow us to develop    this understanding.
Our Communications Features
Our site offers registered users the ability to forward along    objects of interest to others, and in some cases to    communicate with an auction house concerning an object    offered in an upcoming auction. In order to facilitate this    communication, a registered user's email of record must be    accessed.
As a service to auction houses, we keep track of    communications between registered users and auction houses.    Not all auction houses permit direct communication with our    users. We may store destination emails sent by users to    auction houses with questions or request for more information    about an object. If an auction house requests more    information about a user, we may share that information if we    determine that is in our interest to do so. We may disable    your capability to communicate with a specific auction    house. We may also revoke your auction house communication    privileges at any time without notifying you if we determine    that it is in our interest to do so.
Communications with Our Customers, Customer Support, and     Promotional E-mail
From time to time, it may be necessary to notify subscribers     of impending subscription expirations, account or credit card     issues, transactions completed, and in the case of registered     users terms agreement or policy changes. While such     communication will typically be conducted through email, as     appropriate, mail or phone may also be used.
We may also use your personal information to send you e-mail     newsletters and other promotional emails about services and     products that we believe may be of interest to you.
While we do not presently, in the future we may use the    information you provide to send you e-mail and mail only for    products offered by AuctionZip or its affiliates, or to    determine your interest in programs or services that we    believe may be of interest to you. These materials will be    offered on an opt-in basis only.
Subscription Billing
We charge fees for using our subscription level services. At    present, these are AuctionZip Basic, AuctionZip Premium, and    AuctionZip Professional subscriptions. To enable the purchase    of these products, AuctionZip collects and stores billing and    credit card information. This information will be shared only    with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the    purchase transaction. Examples of such tasks include    processing credit card payments for new subscriptions,    subscription renewals and subscription upgrades. Please see    Protection of Your Information for other relevant    information.
Access Control
In order to access paid subscription products, you will be    required to enter a user name and password through our secure    sign-in on each visit. At that time, the current status of    your subscription will be checked, and appropriate access    given according to the information on file.
Compliance with Legal Process
We may disclose personal information if we are required to do    so by law, or in good faith believe that such action is    necessary to: 1) comply with the law or with legal process;    2) protect and defend our rights and property; 3) protect    against misuse or unauthorized use of AuctionZip.com data; or    4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or    the public (among other things, this means that if you    provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else,    information about you may be disclosed as part of any    investigation into your actions).
Sharing Your Personally Identifiable Information
In some instances, we use third party companies to help us    provide our products and services to you, like a shipping    company that delivers a package or an e-mail delivery service    that sends out our e-mails or e-newsletters. In those    instances we need to share your information with them. We    require that those companies use the information only to    deliver our product or service.
AuctionZip will share some or all of your personal    information with another business entity should we plan to    merge with or be acquired by that business entity. In the    event that such a combination occurs, we will require that    the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with    respect to your personal information. If your personal    information will be used contrary to this policy, you will    receive prior notice in as provided in Section 2 above.
If it is clear from the information that you provide us that    you are a member of the antiques, art, auction or related    trades we may, in our sole discretion list you in    directories, or other areas of our site, and may use the name    of your firm and your relationship to us in marketing or    advertising on our site, or in our promotional materials,    paid advertising, or other media in order to promote our    services. We will not display the content of your email    submissions about our services as testimonials for    promotional purposes without your express permission.
Advertising
We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when     you visit our web site. These companies may utilize cookies, pixels     or other technologies to collect and use both personally identifiable     information (e.g., your name, physical or electronic address) and     non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information,     browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or     scrolled over) during your visits to this and other web sites in order     to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of     greater interest to you.  To learn more about this behavioral     advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you     can visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance     at www.aboutads.info or Networking Advertising Initiative     at www.networkadvertising.org/choices .
3) HOW YOU CAN CORRECT INFORMATION
Except for tracking and aggregated information, or as    outlined in the section 5) below on Security and Protection    of Your Information, all your information is available to you    for review and update through your AuctionZip Home and    AuctionZip User Home page.
4) OUR E-MAIL POLICIES
We will send you e-mails relating to your account. These    include order confirmations, renewal/expiration notices, and    credit card problem notifications.
If you send auction houses emails with a question, or    requesting more information about an object, the auction    house may respond by email at your registered email    address. Similarly, if you send emails to others to forward    objects on AuctionZip, the recipients of those emails may    respond by email to your registered email address.
If we offer, and you have registered for upcoming auction    alerts or online discussions, you may receive emails specific    to your participation online.
Email Newsletters
We may offer e-mail newsletters. If you do not wish to    receive newsletters, you can follow the 'unsubscribe' instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter.
Promotional E-mails
We may e-mail you messages that we think may be of interest    to you about other products and services. You can choose not    to receive additional future messages by following the    'unsubscribe' instructions located near the bottom of each    e-mail."
5) SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We take very seriously our commitment to protect your    personal information. To this end, we maintain a secure    process to collect, transmit and store your personally    identifiable information including credit card details.
Subscribers can review or change their registration, or    subscription information at any time through the AuctionZip    Home or AuctionZip User Home page with the exception of card    number and card verification number which cannot be viewed or    changed by any means.
We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to    divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account    and close your browser window when you have finished your    visit. This ensures that others cannot access your account,    especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or    using a computer in a public place.
As a dynamic and growing Site, AuctionZip may contain links    to other sites that are not under our control. Those Web    sites have their own policies regarding privacy. For your    own protection, you should review their policies upon    visiting these other sites to make sure they meet your    expectations of privacy.
