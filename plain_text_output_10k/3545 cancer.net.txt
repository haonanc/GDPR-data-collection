We collect several types of information from and about you when you use or visit our Website, including Personally Identifiable Information (or PII) , Non-Personal Information (or NPI) , and Web Information , as outlined in this Section.
a. NPI and Web Information.  If you use the Website, regardless of whether you are a Registered User , we will collect NPI and Web Information .

Generally, the NPI and Web Information we collect about you is attached to arbitrary system names that are assigned to visitors when they enter the Website.  We may, however, link your NPI or Web Information with your PII in the event that you become a Registered User .  In addition, providers of third-party Cookies, Pixels, Web Beacons, dynamic tags, and/or other technologies used on the Website may have the ability to both link your activities on the Website (including Web Information ) with information collected about you elsewhere on the Internet or otherwise in their possession and to use it for their own business purposes, including to provide you with advertising. (See Section 5 for more information on third-party Cookies.)
b. PII.  We collect PII directly from you when you provide it to us, such as in the following ways:
Information that you provide by filling out forms on our Website. This includes, without limitation, information provided at the time of registering as a Registered User of the Website, updating your registration or profile information, subscribing or unsubscribing to any of our services, registering for meetings, posting material or comments, providing feedback, requesting further information or services, or questionnaires geared towards personalizing content.

We reserve the right (a) to ask you to provide evidence of your authority at any time during, or even after, the submission process and (b) to contact those individuals to confirm your authority at any time.

You may also send us an email at privacy@asco.org to request access to, correct, or delete any PII that you have provided to us.  We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.  If you withdraw your registration as a Registered User of the Website we may retain your PII in our records and we may continue to use and disclose that data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, unless you request deletion of it.
If you delete your User Contributions from the Website, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Website users.  Please refer to our Terms of Use for information relating to the proper access and use of User Contributions.
8. Your Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information
You are able to control your information in the following ways:
Promotional Offers from ASCO and Third Parties

Cookies
. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser Cookies, delete Cookies after a time, or to alert you when Cookies are being sent.  Your Browser can be set to reject all Cookies and you can clear Cookies at any time. A “help” section of most Browsers’ toolbars usually offers instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies . To learn how you can manage your Flash Cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings on Adobe’s website.  If you disable or refuse Cookies, please note that some parts of the Website may not function properly, or may no longer be accessible.  Various third parties provide additional tools to assist you in managing your own preferences regarding Cookies and Online Behavioral Advertising.
9. How We Secure and Dispose of Your Information
ASCO has implemented reasonable security measures designed to secure your PII from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. Access to data and technology relating to user information is password-protected and limited to authorized personnel and those vendors that require access to the information in order to furnish services to ASCO and our members. In addition, ASCO uses industry standard technology to keep users’ information secure while residing on ASCO’s servers.  However, despite these measures, our IT systems could be compromised by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data, by a technological malfunction or by an error by an employee, vendor or contractor.  In addition, the transmission of information via the Internet could be intercepted by third parties.  As a result, our efforts to protect our data and users’ data from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful and we cannot assure you that the security measures we have adopted will provide absolute certainty.  By using, accessing or become a Registered User of the Website, you agree that ASCO is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort arising from or relating to any breach of our security, circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures, or interception of your transmissions (see Terms of Use ).  Any transmission by you or use of our Website is at your own risk.
When you provide PII and credit card information for e-commerce transactions, this information is encrypted using industry-standard SSL Encryption technology before being sent over the Internet.  We submit to the appropriate credit card clearinghouse only the information necessary to collect payment. All credit card information retained by ASCO, including credit card numbers if you elect to store them on your account, is compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website like message boards.  The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.
Information related to your ASCO membership will be retained unless you contact us at privacy@asco.org to request its deletion.  Other information you provide to us and that we collect from you will be retained for no longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was obtained, or for a period specifically required by law or regulation.  Your information will be disposed of in a manner that seeks to prevent loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized access. 
10.  How the Interactive Areas of the Website Operate
As a service to our users, the Website may feature message boards, chat rooms, listservs, and/or other public forums where users can share information or where users can post questions. We may also offer online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.
In addition, you may choose to use certain interactive content, tools, and services that ask you to voluntarily provide information about yourself. Some of these tools (like certain quizzes or calculators) do not retain information, while others may store information in accordance with the authorization you provide at the time you use the service or tool. Please be aware of this fact.
Any chat room, message board, forum or similar interactive service is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. ASCO is not responsible for the privacy of information voluntarily provided by a user in interactive areas. You should think carefully before disclosing any PII in any public forum because what you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for purposes unauthorized by you.
11. The Oncology Career Center™
Because the Oncology Career Center™ ( careercenter.asco.org ) is a career site, it gives job seekers the option of posting their resumes to our database. There are two ways to post a resume.
Non-Searchable Submission
. You can store your resume in our database, but elect during the registration process to exclude your resume from searches by potential employers. Excluding your resume from database searches means that you can use it to apply for and respond to individual job postings, but employers will not have the ability to search for it.
Searchable Submission
. During the registration process you will have the option to allow your resume to be searchable by potential employers. Selecting this option permits all parties with access to our searchable resume database to have access to your resume.
You may remove your resume from the database, and change the status of the resume from searchable to non-searchable, and vice-versa, at any time by updating your profile page on the Oncology Career Center™. 
Please note that the Oncology Career Center™ is an interactive service that uses Cookies and tracking technologies, subject to the policies and disclaimers in Section 5 of this Privacy Policy and in the Terms of Use . We cannot and do not guarantee that third parties will not, without our or your consent, gain access to our resume database. You hereby expressly (a) acknowledge that registered employers and other third parties who gain access to the database with or without our or your consent may retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases, even if you subsequently change the status of your resume to non-searchable, and (b) agree that in no event shall ASCO be responsible or liable for the retention, use, duplication, distribution, or privacy of resumes in these instances.
12. Children Under the Age of 13 - Compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
Our Website is not intended for children under 13 years of age.  No one under age 13 may provide any PII to or on our Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@asco.org .
13. Your California Privacy Rights
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please send us an email to privacy@asco.org or write us at American Society of Clinical Oncology, Inc., 2318 Mill Road, Suite 800, Alexandria, Virginia 22312, Attn: Privacy Officer.
California Do Not Track Disclosure
. ASCO does not have a mechanism in place for responding to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms used to limit collection of information for use in Online Behavioral Advertising.
14.  Changes to our Privacy Policy
ASCO reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revised terms directly to this page.  Amendments to this Privacy Policy are effective when posted and the date on which the Privacy Policy was last revised is identified at the top of this page.  ASCO does not have an obligation to provide further notice of any changes and it is each user’s responsibility to monitor and review updates to this Privacy Policy.  If we make material changes to how we treat our users’ PII, we will notify you by email to the primary email address specified in your account, to the extent you are a Registered User with us and provided a deliverable email address.  You are responsible for ensuring that we have an up-to-date, active and deliverable email address for you.  Your continued use of the Website after the posting of amendments will be deemed acceptance of the changes to the Privacy Policy.

16. Glossary
Aggregate Information. Non-Personal Information , Web Information , or Personally Identifiable Information that has been de-identified and that is combined with similar data related to more than one individual to form aggregated information.  For example, the site may add up the total number of people in Peoria, Illinois (but not their names) who are seeking information about pancreatic cancer and compare that to the number of people in Petaluma, California seeking the same information.  This sort of statistical information is called Aggregate Information because it reflects the habits and characteristics of an anonymous group of people. Websites may use aggregate data or share it with third parties so that the information and services provided best meet the needs of their users. Aggregate Information also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Website know how effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their target audience.
Browser. Short for web browser, a browser is a software application used to locate and display pages of the Internet. Popular browsers include Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, and Apple Safari. Most modern browsers can present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats.
Cookie (or browser cookie). A small data file that is stored on the computer you use to view a website. Cookies are placed by that site (“first party”) or by a third party with a presence on the site (“third party”), such as an advertiser using a Web Beacon , and are generally accessed only by the party or site that placed the Cookie on the computer (i.e. a Cookie placed on your computer by ASCO is generally not accessed by any other site you visit but a Cookie placed on your computer by an advertiser may be accessed by any site on which that same advertiser has a presence). Cookies can contain pieces of Personally Identifiable Information . Cookies often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you check a box to ask that we store your Username on your computer so that you don’t have to enter it each time you visit the site, that information is stored in a Cookie on your computer.  Cookies may be persistent (meaning that they are saved on your computer even after you close your Browser and may be accessed at a later time) or non-persistent (meaning that they are deleted when you close your Browser ). Cookies may be “essential” for the use of a website, such as for example session-id cookies, authentication cookies, or user centric security cookies, or “non-essential” for the use of a website, such as for example, third party advertising cookies or other tracking cookies.
Encryption. The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is one way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or Password that enables you to decrypt it. This is typically done by so called “secure computer systems.”
Non-Personal Information (“NPI”). Information that may relate to an individual but does not by itself identify that individual. For example, Web Information is Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age, city, and physical location, when not linked with other Personally Identifiable Information .  NPI may be “re-identified” through certain processes by linking it to PII relating to the same individual.
Online Behavioral Advertising.  The practice of using online tracking technologies such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect information, including Web Information , about a user’s online activities over time and/or across third-party websites or other online services in order to deliver advertising and content tailored to the user’s apparent interests.
Opt-In. An option that allows you to actively indicate your preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you “Opt-in” you must provide certain information, usually Personally Identifiable Information, to the website or otherwise actively indicate your choice or preference to participate in the website program. For example, if you wish to receive a newsletter by email from the Journal of Clinical Oncology ( jco.ascopubs.org ), you can enter your email address and choose the type of newsletter by checking a box next to a statement such as: “Yes, I’d like to receive the JCO Newsletters.”
Opt-Out. An option that allows you to actively indicate your preference not to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website. Typically, if you “Opt-Out” you must uncheck a box next to a stated preference or otherwise take some action to indicate your preference not to participate in a program. Failure to opt-out typically means that you will, by default, participate in the program, feature, tool or enhancement.
Password. A secret series of characters, typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and numbers), that enables a user to access a file, computer, or program. The user must enter its, his, or her password before the computer or system will respond to commands. The password helps ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In addition, data files and programs may require a password. A password should be something that nobody but the user could guess.
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”).  Information that identifies or is uniquely associated with an individual, such as a name, tax payer identification number, home address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, or credit card number.
