Like most website operators, Tribute collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,    such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request when visitors use the Website.

From time to time, Tribute may    release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website. Tribute also collects    potentially personally- identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the    Website. For instance, Tribute may monitor the Website to help identify spam.
In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using to access the Website, including the type of device, the operating    system, device settings, device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're    using and its settings. To learn more about the information your device makes available to us, please review the policies of your device manufacturer or    software provider.

We use cookies to help us understand which areas of our Website are useful and which areas need    improvement.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Except as otherwise provided in this policy, we disclose the potentially personally-identifying information you disclose to Tribute only to those of our    employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country and by using    the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, we disclose personally-identifying only when required to do so    by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Tribute, third parties or the public    at large.

In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets    that is transferred. Moreover, if Tribute or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Tribute goes out of business or    enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may    occur, and that any acquiror of Tribute may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, we will    not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
