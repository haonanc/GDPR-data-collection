DS SolidWorks collects Personal Data online and offline (e.g., via a business card voluntarily given to a DS SolidWorks employee) and this Privacy Policy is applicable regardless of the means of collection. 
The Sites’ Terms of Use, which can be found here are incorporated into this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Sites and any Personal Data You provide to us are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and those Terms of Use.

DS SolidWorks products (other than SOLIDWORKS Apps for Kids, which is subject to a separate privacy policy), are not marketed to children under the age of 13 and DS SolidWorks does not knowingly collect, or store Personal Data from children under the age of 13. Additionally, DS SolidWorks will not collect or store Personal Data, or send email marketing messages to those who are 13, 14, and 15 years old unless permitted by the local data protection laws.
Certain DS SolidWorks products and services may be appropriate for use by children, however, in which case children below the age of consent under local data protection laws must seek consent from their parents or guardians prior to creating a DS SolidWorks account or registering a product. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of parents and guardians and provide consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents or guardians to do so).
If parents or guardians become aware that their child has provided DS SolidWorks with Personal Data without their consent or without a teacher’s or school administrator’s consent, they can ask DS SolidWorks to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account by sending an email to privacy@solidworks.com .
If DS SolidWorks becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data from a child below the age of consent under local data protection laws without consent from a parent or guardian, DS SolidWorks will take steps to seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent for that processing or to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account.
