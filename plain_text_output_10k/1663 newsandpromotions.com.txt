1. Collection of Information.
1.2 Individual Information.
NewsAndPromotions.com obtains information from individuals (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by NewsAndPromotions.com or by a Third Party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through NewsAndPromotions.com customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a NewsAndPromotions.com service or newsletter.
1.3 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.
NewsAndPromotions.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database. Additionally, NewsAndPromotions.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, Technology Information).
(a) Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual’s computer that allows NewsAndPromotions.com to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in NewsAndPromotions.com database. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com . Individuals who use the Website need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Website.
(b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function — see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual’s unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows NewsAndPromotions.com to track certain websites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes. For example, NewsAndPromotions.com might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party’s website where baseball products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in NewsAndPromotions.com database, visits the baseball website, NewsAndPromotions.com receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the baseball site, and NewsAndPromotions.com would then update Joe’s profile with the information that Joe is interested in baseball. NewsAndPromotions.com may thereafter present offers of baseball related products and services to Joe.
