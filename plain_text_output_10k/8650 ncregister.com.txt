Our Policy
EWTN News respects and protects the privacy of our online visitors and donors. EWTN News does not disclose, give, sell or transfer to third parties any personal information about our visitors without their permission, unless required by law.
Throughout its history, EWTN News has never shared its donor mailing lists or personal information with third parties. It remains EWTN News's policy that mailing lists, both postal and electronic, are never sold or exchanged with third parties.
EWTN News is part of the EWTN family.  EWTN, EWTN Religious Catalogue, and EWTN News are related public charities that work together. Because EWTN News is a supporting organization of EWTN, EWTN is not a third party to this policy and we may share information between the public charities. 
Some Information is Necessary to Complete a Donation or Fulfill an Order
