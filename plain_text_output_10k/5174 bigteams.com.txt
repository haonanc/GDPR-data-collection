We provide a link to this Policy wherever it applies, such as on our websites, our mobile apps, our social networking presence on Facebook, and other online services that we provide and control (“Services”).

This Policy is incorporated by reference into the BigTeams Terms of Use (“ TOU ”), which also governs your use of our Services.

We may require certain types of personal information in order to provide a particular Service

Cookies
We use “cookies” in a very limited way in order to store user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our site to recognize your computer. The help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to use some of the functions of the website.
Provide Services
Your information will be accessible to BigTeams staff and school administrators who may choose to allow booster club members access to some personally identifiable information in order to, for example, fill orders from the online store. Merchant account providers that handle credit card transactions will also have some access to personally identifiable information. This is necessary to fill orders from the online store. Please contact us for more information about your school’s merchant account provider. These merchant account providers have their own privacy policies.
Disclosures
BigTeams may disclose information about you and your use of the Web Site and the BigTeams Services if BigTeams believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary
• To comply with the law or legal process
• To protect or defend the rights or property of BigTeams or others
• To enforce the BigTeams TOU or this Policy
• To respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another.
Reports
We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the Web Site and BigTeams Services for our internal use as well as for a limited number of our business partners. These reports include aggregate (non-personal) information about BigTeams members, and in certain instances, visitors to the Web Site. The information in these reports will not identify you individually. Our business partners who have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports.
Third Party Advertisers
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Most advertisements you see on the Web Site are served to your web browser by BigTeams. However, BigTeams allows other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Web Site or through BigTeams Services. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We only authorize our third-party ad networks to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access to, any personally identifying information about you. BigTeams also limits the type of ads delivered by these ad networks so that they are appropriate for children. Third Party advertising networks may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. BigTeams may also include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by BigTeams to assist with auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.  Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network’s web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). Please contact us if you would like additional information regarding the specific third-party ad networks used on the Web Site.
Third Party Affiliates
This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
In addition BigTeams may share or transfer information about you and that you provide to BigTeams, to one or more third party entities pursuant to a sale, merger, assignment, joint venture or other transfer or disposition of a portion, or all of, the assets or stock of BigTeams or its affiliated entities, or as otherwise provided herein.
CAN SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
We collect your email address in order to:
• Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
• We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.
• Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred
To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:
• NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses
• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way
• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters
• Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly
• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email
If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, there are unsubscribe options with all email and text communications as well as controls within accounts. If you have any issues please contact us at support@bigteams.com.
California Residents
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. This document represents our compliance with CalOPPA.
Security
BigTeams takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information. When you submit information via our service, your information is protected both online and offline. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you. However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and BigTeams will not be intercepted by others and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion. If you have any questions about the security of our service, please contact us.
Children
BigTeams is committed to the safety of children. Children under the age of 13 may not register or participate in any of the BigTeams Services. If children under 18 elect to register in any of the BigTeams Services, they should ask a parent for permission before sending any information to the Web Site. We will not request or knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from a child under 13. We offer our Services to individuals who are at least 18 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information online from children under the age of 13, we will endeavor promptly to destroy or remove any identifying details.
Links
You should be aware that when you are on the Web Site or when you receive emails sent as part of BigTeams Services, you could be directed to other sites beyond our control, and beyond the school/booster club’s control. This includes links from advertisers, sponsors and affiliates that may use the Web Site’s logo. These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
