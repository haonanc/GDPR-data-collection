EQUIFAX ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY & FAIR INFORMATION PRINCIPLES (U.S. Only)
For more than 100 years, Equifax has been a catalyst for commerce by bringing businesses and consumers together. Equifax also provides products and services that bring businesses together with other businesses.
Building our Reputation
We have built our reputation on our commitment to deliver reliable information to our customers (both businesses and consumers) and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of personal information about consumers. We also protect the sensitive information about businesses. Safeguarding the privacy and security of information, both online and offline is a top priority for Equifax.
This privacy policy applies Equifax's commitment to privacy in an online setting. This privacy policy applies to the following Equifax U.S. web sites:
This privacy policy applies to both individual consumers and certain business organizations that use these web sites.
We take reasonable steps to give you, as a visitor to these web sites, clear notice of:
when we are requesting information from you;
the types of information we request from you;
the general purposes for which that information will be used or disclosed;
the categories of users to whom we provide the information; and
Offer you as an individual the ability to opt out of certain uses of the information we collect about you online;
Maintain accurate records, provide you access to the personally identifiable information or business organization identifiable information that is retrievable online, or that is contained in your individual credit file or your business organization credit file, and provide you a fair procedure to update and correct such information; and

The Information We Collect About You
This Equifax online privacy policy applies to all information we receive online from you and about you in connection with an online transaction or request. The information, if any, which we collect from or about you while you are accessing and using our web sites covered by this privacy policy depends on what you do while you on our web sites. If you do not: 1) register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, 2) request disclosure of your individual credit file or individual credit score, 3) file an online dispute reinvestigation request, 4) request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, 5) request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, or 6) become a Member of Personal Solutions or request a Personal Solutions product, then we do not collect any personally identifiable information or business organization identifiable information about you while you are accessing or using our web sites.
If you do: 1) register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, 2) request disclosure of your individual credit file or individual credit score, 3) file an online dispute reinvestigation request, 4) request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, 5) request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, or 6) become a Member of Personal Solutions or request a Personal Solutions product, then we do collect personally identifiable information or business organization identifiable information from you or about you online. However, in these situations we only collect certain information from you and about you to process your request and to verify your identity to be sure that we are assisting the proper individual or business organization.
Information From You
Specifically, we receive information from you online when you: 1) register or fill out any forms at an Equifax web site, 2) request disclosure of your individual credit file or individual credit score, 3) file an online dispute reinvestigation request, 4) request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, 5) request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, or 6) become a Member of Personal Solutions or request a Personal Solutions product. Becoming a Member of Personal Solutions enables you as an individual to purchase Personal Solutions products, such as Equifax Credit Report™; Score Power®; Equifax Credit Watch™; or 3-in-1 Credit Report, and you as a business organization to purchase Personal Solutions products, such as Equifax Business Credit Report™, or Equifax Business Credit Report With Score™. Additionally, when you as an individual do any of these things we will verify your identity by asking you to provide certain information that only you should know and we may ask you from two to six multiple-choice questions about "non-wallet-type" information contained in your individual credit file. The answers to these questions used to verify your identity as an individual are not provided to any nonaffiliated third party. When you as a business organization become a Member of Personal Solutions we may ask for information to verify your business organization.
We also receive information from you online when you send us e-mail, applications and other forms, or register at our web sites.
We may also collect information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as the products and services you ordered. In connection with requests for Personal Solutions products, for example, we access your Equifax individual credit file information or your Equifax business organization credit file. In connection with verifying your identity as an individual we may also collect from outside sources personally identifiable information about you, such as name, address, driver's license information, and e-mail addresses. When you request your free annual Equifax individual credit report through www.annualcreditreport.com , the information you provide at that web site is provided to us to process your request. Also, in connection with verifying the identity of you as a business organization we may collect from outside sources business organization identifiable information, such as name, address, and e-mail address.
How We Use The Information We Collect
We use the information we collect about you to handle the requests you make to us. If you as an individual request an individual credit file disclosure or an individual credit score disclosure, either directly from us or through www.annualcreditreport.com , or initiate an online dispute reinvestigation, or request an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file online, or request a security freeze, a temporary lift, or a permanent removal of a security freeze on your credit file online, the information we collect from you is only used to handle those requests and possibly update your Equifax individual credit file.
In connection with your online request that an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert be placed on your credit file, we will use your email address to communicate with you regarding the status of your online request for an initial fraud alert or an active duty alert.
When you become a Member of Personal Solutions we also use the information we collect about you. Once you have become Member of Personal Solutions, we use the information when you ask Personal Solutions to provide you: 1) the Personal Solutions products and services you requested; 2) support for these Personal Solutions products and services; and 3) information about your Personal Solutions products.
Additionally, as legally permitted, we may use the information we collect for your Personal Solutions Membership and other requests, including postal address and/or e-mail address, to send you promotions for Personal Solutions products and services. (Of course, you may opt out of receiving such promotions. See the "CHOICE" section of this privacy policy.)
Information collected when you register at Equifax web sites other than the web sites to which this privacy policy applies (they are identified at the beginning of this privacy policy) is used for the purposes identified on those web site registration forms.
To Whom We May Disclose The Information We Collect
We may disclose any information collected from you or about you through the web sites to which this Privacy Policy applies as required by law or legal process.
We take reasonable precautions to be sure that nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates, to whom we disclose personally identifiable information or business organization identifiable information, as described below, are aware of our privacy policy and fair information principles and will treat the information in a similarly responsible manner. Our contracts and written agreement with nonaffiliated third parties that receive information from us about you as an individual, who has not opted out of this disclosure, prevent further transfer of the information.
When personally identifiable information or business identifiable information is collected when you register at an Equifax web site other than those covered by this privacy policy, the information will be disclosed, if at all, pursuant to the privacy policy for that web site.
Equifax is not, however, responsible for the privacy practices or content of link sites listed on our web pages. The owners of these pages are responsible for them.
