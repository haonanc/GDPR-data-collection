Sweepstakes and Contests Privacy Policy
The Information We Collect
As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that is linked to your identity such as your name, street address, telephone number, mobile number, screen name, age and/or email address. The Site you entered may collect some or all of these types of Personal Information through a sweepstakes, contest, game or promotion, or a registration form. Our website promotion may require registration and disclosure of particular information such as an email address in order for you to participate in sweepstakes, games or other activities. In order to register for our promotions, we require you to disclose your name, zip code, email address, birthdate and in some cases your mobile number. Culver Franchising System, LLC. will not collect any Personal Information from your visits to our Website unless you provide your Personal Information to us voluntarily, and we will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in our promotions. We also do not collect financial or other sensitive data information about our users.
When you provide us with Personal Information, you are authorizing us to use that information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, which includes your right to limit our use of your Personal Information as described in this Policy.
The Site you entered may also collect Personal Information from you about a third party (e.g., the Site might allow you to send an email or message to a friend, in which case we will need that person's name and email address). Please note that we use such information only for the specified purpose (e.g., to deliver the email message) and we will not contact the third party again by email unless and until the third party contacts us or provides permission to do so.
The Way We Use Personal Information
When you supply Personal Information at Culver’s Website, we will consolidate such Personal Information and use it for the purpose for which it was collected (e.g., to enter you in a sweepstakes or to fulfill the delivery of a sweepstakes prize) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you opt in to receive our eClub, we will also use it to contact you regarding Culver’s products or promotions as well as other products and services, which may be requested by or otherwise of interest to you. At any time, however, you may opt out of such future contact by unsubscribing from our database by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.
With Whom We May Share Information
In the course of doing business, we employ other companies to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. For example, we may share Personal Information including email address or mailing address with fulfillment houses and other service providers to allow delivery of prizes. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information if it is needed to perform their functions for Culver Franchising System, LLC. but they are not authorized by us to use your Personal Information in any way other than the intended use within the promotion. We do not share your Personal Information including email address with any third parties who are not service providers.
We also may share aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our users with third parties. For example, we may tell a business partner the number of people that entered a contest, but we do not disclose Personal Information about such contestants in violation of this Privacy Policy.
