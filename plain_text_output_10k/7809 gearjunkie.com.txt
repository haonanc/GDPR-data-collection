How We Use Cookies
Gearjunkie.com sets several cookies which are necessary for the proper functioning of the web site. Additionally, our advertising platform and providers set and read cookies to track the advertisements our visitors see. This data is not personally identifiable.
A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.
We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

Affiliate Link Disclosure Statement
We work hard to test gear and find outdoor stories that are relevant to you. Did you know that you can support GearJunkie by purchasing your gear through the links on our site? Yup, it’s true, and we appreciate the support as it helps us provide top-notch stories and gear reviews to you and millions of other readers.
In some of our stories, we link to relevant and trusted affiliate partners like REI, Amazon, Patagonia, The North Face, etc. If a GearJunkie user clicks an affiliate link and purchases a product or service from any of these affiliate sites within a set amount of time GearJunkie receives a small commission. Affiliate linking has become a regular process in digital publishing. Though these commissions help us pay for things like excellent journalism, rent, and office beers, it doesn’t interfere with our goal of giving objective, unbiased gear reviews and stories. Our editorial and marketing teams are separate divisions within GearJunkie and we do not accept payment in any form for positive reviews or stories.
Advertising
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers. We may use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the website, one of which is https://www.google.com/adsense. These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith.
