Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this                 notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make                 about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to                 find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable                 information may be requested.
The Information We Collect
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the USA-Foreclosure.com                 website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive                 materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

The Way We Use Information
We use the information you provide about yourself when providing services only.                 We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent required                 by law.
We will not sell or disclose your e-mail address except to the extent required by                     law.
We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are                 not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
You can register with our website if you would like to receive our e-mail property                 updates. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose                 unless you explicitly register for this service.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and                 to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number                 of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and                 Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything                 that could be used to identify those individuals.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided                 to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing                 you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use                 of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial                 procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason,                 we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know                 are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information
You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online                 and maintain by modifying this information online. We use this procedure to better                 safeguard your information.
You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending                 us a request that credibly shows error.
To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify                 your identity before granting access or making corrections.
