Personally Identifiable Information
If you send us an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains                         personally identifying information, or fill out a form that e-mails us this information,                         we will only use the personally-identifiable information to respond to your request                         and analyze trends.

Some departments ask that forms be submitted in                         regard to acceptance into the school or their individual program and are reviewed                         by admittance committees. In regard to filling out forms, you will be given a chance                         to "opt out" of completing the form.
