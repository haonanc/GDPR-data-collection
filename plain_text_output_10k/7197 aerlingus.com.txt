Example
We may send a communication informing you that check in is open or if your flight has been delayed.

You may receive marketing communications from us if you have you made a booking with us (unless you have indicated that you do not wish to receive marketing communications). We will respect your choice as to what communications you wish to receive and how these are sent.  Please be aware that we do sometimes send marketing communications that promote a third party's products and services as well as our own (for example, we  may send Aer Lingus communications promoting products or services of our business partner Aer Lingus Holidays or we may send AerClub communications promoting products or services of our business partner Avios).
We may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you. This enables us to send you only those offers and deals that we think will be of most interest to you.
How can you change what marketing communications you receive and how you receive them?
If you decide you would no longer like to be sent marketing communications you can change your mind at any time. The ways to stop being sent marketing communications are described below. We collect separate permissions for AerClub marketing communications and Aer Lingus marketing communications. The Aer Lingus marketing list is a separate list held and managed separately to the AerClub marketing list and unsubscribing from one list will not automatically unsubscribe you from the other i.e. you can indicate that do not wish to receive Aer Lingus marketing material but you can still opt to receive AerClub offers and deals (and vice versa).
You can change your marketing preferences for Aer Lingus marketing communications at any time at:
https://www.aerlingus.com/html/email-subscription.html to sign up
In addition, each marketing communication we send by email will also have an "unsubscribe" option which will allow you to stop you receiving further marketing emails.
If you book a seat in the economy cabin on certain qualifying transatlantic fares we may send an email  giving you the opportunity to make us an offer to "Upgrade Yourself";  details here: https://www.aerlingus.com/plan-and-book/plan/upgrade-yourself/ . We partner with a third party (PlusGrade) to offer this promotion.

We aim to action requests to stop being sent marketing communications within 24 hours of receiving those requests (but it may take up to 48 hours) and it is possible you will receive some marketing in the period prior to that change being made.
Please note that if you tell us that you do not wish to be sent further marketing communications, you will still receive service communications which are necessary, for example, to confirm your booking or to provide you with an update you on its status.  If you are an AerClub Member, we will continue to keep you informed about your membership and other important service information relating to AerClub.

Aer Lingus will only process your personal information where we have a legal basis to do so. The legal basis will depend on the reason or reasons Aer Lingus collected and needs to use your information. Under EU and Irish data protection laws in almost all cases the legal basis will be:
because we need to use your information so that we can process your booking, fulfil your travel arrangements and otherwise perform the contract we have with you; or
because it is in Aer Lingus' legitimate interests as an airline to use your personal information in order to operate and improve our business as an airline and travel provider; or
because Aer Lingus needs to use your personal information in order to comply with a legal obligation; or
to protect the vital interests of you or another person; or
because you have consented to Aer Lingus using your information for a particular purpose.
More information on each legal basis is provided below.  In the event that processing of your data is subject to any other laws (other than EU and Irish laws) then the basis of processing your data may be different to that set out above and may in those circumstances be based on your consent (as defined according to those laws) in all cases.
Performance of a contract with you
It will be necessary for Aer Lingus to use your personal information in order to complete a booking you have made with us. For example, we will need to use information such as your contact details and payment information in order to provide you with the flight you have requested and paid for. If you are an AerClub member it will be necessary for Aer Lingus to use your personal information in order to manage and administer your AerClub membership and to provide member benefits.

We may send you emails about our latest offers if you have made a booking with us (unless you have opted out of receiving marketing emails).

We are legally required to provide passenger information to border control and immigration in some countries such as the UK and USA.
To protect the vital interest of you or another person
There are situations where we may needs to use your personal information in order to protect the vital interests of you or another person.
Example
If we collect and process medical information in the event of a medical emergency and you are incapable of giving your consent.
Consent
Alternatively, we may collect and use your personal information where you have given your specific consent to us doing so.
Example
We will rely on your consent where you have provided information to us voluntarily in order to request special / disability assistance during a flight.
Where the basis of our processing your data is consent, you can withdraw your consent to such processing at any time by contacting Guest Relations at https://www.aerlingus.com/travel-information/special-assistance/disability-assistance/ . However if you withdraw this consent it may mean we will not be able to provide all or parts of the services you have requested from us and in some circumstances you may not be able to cancel your booking or obtain a refund of any charges you have paid.
8. How long do we keep personal information?
We will keep your information for as long as we need it for the purpose it is being processed for. For example, where you book a flight with us we will keep the information related to your booking so we can fulfil the specific travel arrangements you have made and after that we will keep the information for a period which enables us to handle or respond to any complaints, queries or concerns relating to the booking.  The information may also be retained so that we can continue to improve your experience with us and to ensure that you receive any loyalty rewards which are due to you. We will actively review the information we hold and delete it securely, or in some cases anonymise it, when there is no longer a legal, business or customer need for it to be retained. If you stop interacting with us as a guest, we will remove or anonymise information kept for that purpose after 7 years.  When we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other legal reason for retaining the information, if you then decide to withdraw your consent, we will delete your information as detailed below in Section 11(e) (Your right to ask for personal information to be erased or "forgotten") .
9. Who do we share your personal information with?
Your personal information may be shared with the companies within our group, which includes Aer Lingus, International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A (IAG), British Airways, Iberia, Iberia Express, Vueling, Level, British Airways Holidays, Avios, BA CityFlyer, IAG Connect and IAG GBS. For more details about our group please visit the website of our parent company, IAG ( www.iairgroup.com ). We share information with them so they can assist us in providing services to you and to understand more about you. For example, if you have flown with one of the other airlines in the IAG Group we may use this information to understand more about the sorts of travel services you are likely to be interested in. You will only be sent marketing from other companies within our group where you have agreed to this.
We may also disclose your personal information to the following third parties for the purpose described here:
customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary or to which your flight may fly over. Aer Lingus and other airlines are required by laws in the UK, USA and other countries to give border control agencies and customs authorities access to booking and travel information when you fly to and from countries including stop-overs and where you may overfly countries en route to your destination.  Further information about Advanced Passenger Information is available here https://www.aerlingus.com/travel-information/passports-and-visas/travel-to-from-usa/ . Under U.S. Law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will receive certain travel and reservation information, known as Passenger Name Record or PNR data, about passengers flying between the European Union and the U.S. CBP has undertaken that it uses this PNR data for the purposes of preventing and combating terrorism and other transnational serious crimes. The PNR may include information provided during the booking process or held by airlines or travel agents. The information will be retained for at least three years and six months and may be shared with other authorities. Further information about these arrangements, including measures to safeguard your personal data, can be obtained on www.dhs.gov and ec.europa.eu.
Example
Many governments around the world require some passport and travel information (Advanced Passenger Information) from airlines about the people flying into their country. When required, Aer Lingus will provide this information to the relevant customs and immigration authorities. This information includes information held in the machine-readable zone (MRZ) of your passport (passport number, country of issue, passport expiry date, given names, last name, gender and date of birth) together with other information which is not held in the MRZ of your passport (country of residence, citizenship, alien registration card number, destination address in the USA).

Those airlines and other service providers will be identified when you make a booking.

The nature of our business means it is often necessary for us to send your personal information outside the European Economic Area in order to fulfil your travel arrangements. This occurs because our business and the third parties identified in "Who do we share your personal information with?" have operations in countries across the world.  For example, where you are flying outside of the European Economic Area, your personal information will be transferred to border control and immigration outside of these territories.  In addition we may transfer your data to parties in countries outside the country in which you are located to provide services to us.  This may involve sending your data to countries where under their local laws you may have fewer legal rights. However, wherever we store your information we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Statement and the requirements of European and Irish data protection law which requires adequate safeguards to be put in place for transfers of data outside the EEA, unless a derogation permitted under European and Irish data protection law applies.  If you would like more information on these safeguards please contact the Aer Lingus DPO (contact details below).
10.  How we keep your personal information secure
When you purchase flights or access your personal profile online you can do so through a secure server. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology means that all personal information, such as your credit card number, will be encrypted as it travels from your computer or mobile device to the Aer Lingus Online Booking Engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal credit card transaction by telephone.  If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our website via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data will be protected. If your browser does not support SSL, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise the transmission of your personal data may not be protected and Aer Lingus disclaims any responsibility in this regard.

Keep your booking reference confidential
When you make a booking you will be given a booking reference (also known as a PNR or "Passenger Name Record"). This will appear on the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking (and may appear on your bank statement where you use a credit or debit card for payment). You should keep your booking reference confidential at all times.
Giving your booking reference to others may allow them to access your booking details through our system.  You should also take care to dispose of any hard copies securely.  If you are travelling with others and would not like your individual booking details to be accessible by them, you may prefer to have each person make separate bookings, to be paid for individually.

11. Your legal rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you
Under data protection laws in the European Union and in Ireland, you have certain rights in relation to your personal information.  Responses to exercise your rights will be provided within 1 month and generally there is no fee for making these requests. If your request is particularly complicated we may extend the deadline for responding to two months, but we will let you know if this is the case.
We will handle all requests in accordance with applicable law. However, depending on the right you wish to exercise and the nature of the personal information involved, there may be legal reasons why we cannot grant your request.  Further explanation of those rights and the exceptions to them are set out below.

Your rights include the following:
your right of access to your personal information we hold.

your right to ask us to stop sending you direct marketing.
your right to have your personal information corrected (the "right of rectification") if that information is inaccurate.
your right to withdraw consent to processing of data where consent is relied upon by us as the basis of processing.

your right to ask for personal information to be erased (also known as the "right to be forgotten") without undue delay in certain circumstances, for example:
when you withdraw your consent to processing in circumstances where we have collected the personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue to retain the information
where you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate grounds for us to continue the processing (See point f below);
where your personal data has been unlawfully processed.
Example
If you ask us to delete all your personal information that we process based on consent (e.g. a request for special assistance) we may need to retain certain information that relates to a contract between you and Aer Lingus because we need it for our own legal and auditing purposes.
Please note that in some circumstances if you exercise this right before you travel, it may mean we will not be able to provide all or parts of the services you have requested from us and you will not be able to cancel your booking or obtain a refund of any charges you have paid.
Please note while we will endeavour to erase data in circumstances where an individual has exercise this right and we don't need the data anymore some personal data sets are impossible (or infeasible) to edit to remove individual records, e.g. a server backup or a piece of microfiche.
your right to object to the use of your personal information where the basis of our processing the information is our legitimate interests (unless it is needed for dealing with legal claims or we have other compelling legitimate reasons that override your rights)
your right to object to the processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes including profiling for the purposes of direct marketing.
Please note if you exercise this right in relation to all Aer Lingus marketing communications we will no longer send you marketing communications however we will still send you communications about the services you have booked to use, such as your travel itinerary. These communications will help you get the most from the services we provide and may also contain options and other details about the services you will be using (e.g. advance seating requests, additional baggage and pre-booked meals). In addition, we will also need to retain and process some of your personal information to make sure you are excluded from future marketing communications.
Please note that opting out of Aer Lingus marketing communications will not have the effect of removing you from the AerClub marketing list as these are maintained as two separate marketing lists and Guests opt into each list separately.  If you opt out of Aer Lingus marketing communications but have separately opted in to receive AerClub marketing communications you will continue to receive AerClub marketing communication until such time as you indicate you no longer wish to do so. You can do this at any time by logging on and changing your AerClub account settings or by clicking "unsubscribe" in any marketing email.
