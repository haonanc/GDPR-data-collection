Information we collect
Information you give us
When you create an account with us, we save certain information about you like your name, email address, gender, and photo so we can address you appropriately in the Services and in any communications and indicate to you which account you are logged in to the Services with, among other things.
When you are signed in and configure a widget or update your settings, that information is automatically saved. This could include, for example, your location that you entered to see a localized weather forecast or your news preferences.

Information we automatically collect
We collect information about how you use the Services, like which widgets you use and how often you use the Services, to improve them. This information may be associated with your account or Internet Protocol (“IP”) address so we can track things like how many people use a particular widget instead of just how many times a widget was used.
This information is compiled into aggregate statistics that no single person can be identified from. After it’s compiled, we save the original information for a few days and then delete it. However, it may be stored indefinitely in our backups.

Information collected by or provided to third parties
We collect anonymous usage data using industry standard third party analytics services to monitor and better understand the performance and usage of the Services. The information we collect via third party services does not contain personal information, however it may include your IP address.
We use a user feedback and support service, UserVoice, to collect feedback and associate support requests with a particular user. Certain personally identifiable information, such as your name and email address, may be transmitted to UserVoice along with non-personally identifiable information like your IP address and how you submitted a support request, even before you make a support request. We use this information to better respond to support tickets by seeing more about you and how you use the Services along with your inquiry. Your usage of UserVoice, even from inside the Services, is governed by UserVoice’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .
We also use a web performance and security service, CloudFlare, to ensure that the Services are secure and operate quickly. CloudFlare may collect non personally identifiable information about you although we do not directly provide any information to them. Any such collection is governed by CloudFlare’s Privacy Policy .
When you buy Pro or update your billing information some of your personally identifiable information is transmitted to Braintree along with your payment information. Your credit card information is never stored on our systems. Any information handling by Braintree is governed by Braintree's policies .
We use Google Analytics to track general things, CloudFlare to make things faster and more secure, Braintree to process payments, and provide some data to UserVoice so we can handle feedback better

Who we share information with
Personal information
We may disclose your personal information without asking for your consent in order to protect the legal rights of iChrome or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers; to protect the safety and security of users of the Services or to enforce our Terms of Service; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required.

Non-personal information and aggregate data

Because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data.
We might share analytics information and statistics with third parties, but data like that doesn't include anything personal
