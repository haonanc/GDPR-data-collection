3. Registration

Such promotions, contests                                 and sweepstakes will also be governed by the rules and regulations posted with such                                 promotions, contests and sweepstakes.

Participation in these promotions, contests and sweepstakes is completely voluntary                                 and you therefore have a choice whether or not to register and provide your Personal                                 Information.

6. Other Information Collected
Some information may                                             be collected automatically every time you visit the g4wow’s web sites, such as                                             cookies and computer information. In addition, information may be collected from                                             other independent, third-party sources. We also collect information about which                                             pages you visit within this site. This site visitation data is identified only by                                             a unique URL.
7.Cookies
The g4wow uses both session ID cookies and persistent                                             cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric                                             identifier (a file) that the g4wow’s web sites transfer to your computer’s hard                                             drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for                                             record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser,                                             while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.                                             We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our web sites. We                                             use persistent cookies to identify and track which sections of each web site you                                             most often visit. We also use persistent cookies in areas of each web site where                                             you must register, and where you are able to customize the information you see,                                             so that you don't have to enter your preferences more than once. By configuring                                             the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system.                                             However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features                                             on this site and you may be required to reenter the information required to complete                                             an order during new or interrupted browser sessions. Some of the g4wow’s business                                             partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on the site. We have no access to or control                                             over these cookies (see "Third Party Advertising" and "Third Party Cookies" below).                                             Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the g4wow only and                                             does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
8. Log Files
As is true of most web sites, the g4wow gathers certain information automatically                                 and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,                                 browser type, internet services provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating                                 system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. The g4wow uses this information                                 to analyze trends, screen for fraud, administer the g4wow’s sites, track users'                                 movements around the web sites and gather demographic information about the g4wow's                                 user base as a whole.
9.Clear GIFs
The g4wow employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web                                 Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites by informing the g4wow                                 what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier,                                 similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web                                 users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive,                                 clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period                                 at the end of this sentence. The g4wow uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails                                 to inform itself of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the g4wow                                 to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of the                                 g4wow's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please                                 see "Choice and Opt-Out" section of this Privacy Policy.
10.Third Parties
To improve services and enhance personalization, the g4wow may periodically obtain                                 information about you from other independent third party sources and add it to our                                 account information. For example, when you visit a site on which the g4wow advertises,                                 and click through such advertisement, the g4wow may place cookies on your computer.
11.Third Party Advertising
The ads that appear from time to time on the                                     g4wow’s web sites are delivered to you by a third party. Information about your                                     visits to the sites, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other Personal Information), is used to serve ads to you.
12.Use of Information
13.Personal Information
The g4wow collects Personal Information                                     to verify the accuracy of your name, billing address, shipping address, credit card                                     number, and credit card expiration date provided, to screen for fraud, to bill you                                     for products and services purchased and to pay you for products and services sold.                                     The g4wow uses your e-mail address(es) to contact you regarding the status of                                     your order when necessary and to send you a Receipt of Purchase/Sale Confirmation                                     and Order Shipping Notification.
14.Special Offers and Updates
The g4wow collects information about which                                     sections of its web site you visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter                                     and information about relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which                                     may interest you. Accordingly, the g4wow will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.
15.Service-Related Announcements
The g4wow may, but is not obligated to,                                     send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary                                     to do so. For example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance,                                     we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications                                     since they are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you                                     may have the option to deactivate your account.
16.Research
We also collect information for research purposes                                     and to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. The g4wow                                     uses the information collected for its own internal marketing and demographic studies                                     to improve customer service and product offerings.
17.Customer Service
We will communicate with you in response to                                     your inquiries, to provide the products and services you request, and to manage                                     your account.

18.Preferences
The g4wow stores information that it collects                                     through cookies, log files, and third party sources to create a profile of your                                     preferences, in order to improve the content of the g4wow’s web site for you.
19.Information Sharing and Disclosure
The g4wow does not sell or rent any of the                                     information collected to third parties for any purposes, but it shares information                                     with third parties as described below.

However, the g4wow will never share information to any service provider relevant                                     to any asset data, source code, information, e-mails, electronic messages or any                                     information of any asset, product, or service rights transferred to any individual                                     or customer who does business with our g4wow.

These                                     third-party partners do not have independent rights to share the information provided                                     to them by us.

24.Links to Other Web Sites
There are several places throughout the g4wow’s                                     web sites that may link you to other web sites that do not operate under this Privacy                                     Policy. When you click through to these web sites, this Privacy Policy no longer                                     applies. The g4wow recommends that you examine the privacy statements for all                                     third party web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and                                     disclosing your Personal Information.
25.Security
The g4wow protects the privacy and integrity of the information it collects by employing appropriate administrative protocols,                                     technical safeguards, and physical security controls designed to limit access, detect                                     and prevent the unauthorized access, improper disclosure, alteration, or destruction                                     of the information under its control. The g4wow transmits the information used                                     by its external service providers for the specific outsourced operations listed                                     above across public and private networks via recognized encryption technologies,                                     such as by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information                                     you input. Although the g4wow follows the procedures set forth above to protect                                     the Personal Information submitted to the g4wow, no method of transmission over                                     the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
