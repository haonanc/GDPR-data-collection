Keep-It™ Money Back Guarantee
We’ve taken the tricks out of the Money Back Guarantee. Most companies push out mediocre products and rely on the fact that dissatisfied customers are too busy to go through the hassle of returning the product to qualify for their money back. We’re confident you’ll love your Onnit supplements, and we’re not gonna play games with you.
Order any of our entry size supplements, and if you don’t like it, you can keep it. Notify us and we’ll give you a full refund right there on the spot. No complicated intake forms and no return necessary. We trust you, but to protect against fraud, the Keep-It™ guarantee is valid only for first time purchases of a product, and redeemable up to three months after purchase.
Multiple bottles, foods, apparel and gear are subject to our basic, no stress money back guarantee. Fitness equipment, personal care products, knowledge purchases, and DVDs are not eligible. For more information and a full list of products that qualify, visit our Keep-It™ page. To process a refund, visit our support page .
