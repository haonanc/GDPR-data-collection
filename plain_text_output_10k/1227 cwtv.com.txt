CW Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting The CW. The CW Network is a joint venture between Warner Bros. Entertainment and CBS Corporation (collectively "we" or "us"). Your privacy is important to us. To help protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the collection and use of the personally identifiable information collected on our online and mobile websites, services, and applications (“Site” or “Sites”). By using the Sites, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your personal information as described in this notice.
For certain offerings on our Sites, there may be additional notices about information practices and choices. Please read those additional privacy disclosures to understand how they apply to you. 
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Registration and account information. At some Sites, you can order products, play games, read and submit reviews, enter contests, vote in polls, view and rate videos, TV shows and other content, or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that you provide as part of your account may include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card and billing information, information about your interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services, and other information that you provide to us.  In the course of using our Sites, we may ask you to create an account or register for an application by providing us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, as well as to administer your account.
Information about others/inviting friends. At some of our Sites, you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to share content or recommendations, send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people as part of this process include recipient's name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and information about the recipient’s interest in and use of various content, products, programs, and services. 
Some of our Sites also allow you to invite your friends to join our services and to connect with you through social media features. Inviting friends is always optional. To do so, you may provide their contact information or may enter your log-in credentials to import e-mail addresses or usernames from your address book from other sites that support such functionality (e.g., Yahoo!, Gmail, Facebook). You select the friends you want to invite to share in this experience.
Information from other sources. We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance our ability to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you. 
Social media. You can also engage with our content and other offerings, such as videos, contests, games and activities, on or through third-party social media sites, plug-ins and applications, such as those offered by Facebook and others. You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social media sites. When you link your account or engage with our content on or through third party social media sites, services, plug-ins, or applications you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, profile photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends and their contact information, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make). We may also receive non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on, etc.) from your interaction with our content. 
When you provide information to a Site from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (i) give you exclusive content, (ii) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our Sites, and (iii) contact you through the social media sites or directly with the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By providing such information, you consent to the use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
If you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting on a blog, or participating in chat functions or online forums or communities at our Sites, or when you interact with our Sites through social media sites, plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how third party social media sites handle your personally identifiable information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.
Information collection from mobile devices. If you access our Sites, on your mobile telephone or other mobile device, we also may collect your unique device identifier and mobile device IP address (e.g. MAC address), as well as information about your device’s operating system, mobile carrier, and mobile Internet browsers, your precise location information, and other information described in this Policy. 
Technical and usage information. We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you use our Sites, including when you view content and videos on our Sites, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android), the domain name of your Internet service provider or mobile carrier, IP address, device ID and other technical attributes related to your device, and certain usage information.  For example, some content on our Sites is limited to users in the United States and the US territories. Your device IP address is tested by the Site so that The CW can determine whether you are located in the United States or the US territories.

We also may disclose such information in response to a US or other law enforcement agency’s request or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the rights, property, or physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, and to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Sites and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by US or other law or legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer information about our visitors in the event of a business transaction or reorganization, such as if we or one of our business units or our relevant assets are reorganized, acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.
Service providers. Our agents, contractors and other service providers may have access information, including personally identifiable information to help carry out the services they are performing for us.

We sometimes may offer content or programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications or social network integrations) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. We have no control over these third parties' use of this information, which is covered by their own privacy policies. The Site will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.
Advertising. At some of our Sites, reputable third parties may present or serve advertisements, provide us with data collection, reporting, ad response measurement, and site analytics, and assist with delivery of relevant marketing messages and advertisements. These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. The use of these technologies by these third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. They may also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your computer or mobile device, the sites you visit, and other information about you or your computer or device in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Site and elsewhere.

COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNICAL INFORMATION 
Cookies and web beacons. We, and our affiliates, third party service providers, and our business partners may send "cookies" to your computer or use similar technologies to support and enhance your online experience at our Sites, including by helping us collect and understand usage and performance information and to display and measure advertisements. For example, "cookies" are files that can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us and/or other networks or sites. Cookies can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).
Some of our Sites may use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as "Flash cookies") to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your web browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html .
We may also use "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Sites. Web beacons (or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data, such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the types of browser that fetched the web beacon and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. 
When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.
On their own, cookies or web beacons generally do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. However, if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies/web beacons.
Managing cookies and web beacons and Do Not Track. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and web beacons as described herein. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some web beacons. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information. However, certain areas of our Sites can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of our content or Site features. We do not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.
For more information about cookies and how browser settings can be changed to reject them, you should go to your web browser’s Help menu. 
Google Analytics, one of our service providers, provides its own opt-out process.
