The following information details how LabCorp uses information that you provide to us via the LabCorp website and answers commonly asked questions regarding the privacy of your individual information.
What personal information does LabCorp collect?
LabCorp does not ask you to provide personal health care information to us through our general website.* We obtain personally identifying information about you only if you voluntarily choose to provide such information via correspondence with LabCorp. Feedback forms used in LabCorp correspondence specifically request that you not include personal information such as user names, passwords, social security numbers, and private health information. Correspondence conducted via LabCorp feedback forms is stored on a third-party server and then downloaded by LabCorp personnel.

LabCorp utilizes the services of ACI, an independent third party in processing payment information.
How does LabCorp protect the security of your information?
Financial information and payment data, including credit card numbers, that you provide to us via the LabCorp internet bill payment link is encrypted by using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption technology, which employs a 128-bit encryption system. This information may be accessed only by LabCorp employees who maintain password and job-required access rights, and third party vendors who support LabCorp’s billing operations. Additionally, LabCorp maintains all personal patient data within the LabCorp information system (IS) firewalls that operate on separate LabCorp mainframes/servers. The general public may not access these mainframes/servers.
