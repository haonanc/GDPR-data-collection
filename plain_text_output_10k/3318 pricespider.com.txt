USE OF COOKIES
PriceSpider uses cookies to personalize and enhance your user experience. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, etc. When you return to the site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site’s features that you customized. Below is a list of the types of cookies that PriceSpider utilizes in connection with the Services:
The Location Cookie. The Location Cookie is used to store information about your location (such as your zip code) so that you are able to locate nearby stores that have the desired products in stock. Disabling the Location Cookie will cause you to have to re-enter your location (i.e. zip code) when prompted by the Service, in order to locate stores that carry a desired product.
The Analytics Cookie. The Analytics Cookie is used to identify new vs. returning site visitors. When you visit a website for the first time, the Analytics Cookie assigns a randomly generated “globally-unique identifier” (i.e. a very long random number) to you. The Analytics Cookie allows PriceSpider to perform analytics on your behaviors while using the Service and afterwards (such as the amount of time spent on particular pages, the number of clicks on a particular site, and which sites your clicks directed you to, etc.). That said, if you wish to disable the Analytics Cookie, it will have no impact on your experience with the Service.
PriceSpider may occasionally opt to share analytics learned through these cookies with PriceSpider’s customers (i.e. the manufacturers or sellers of the products that you are shopping for through the Service). As a result, if you don’t want PriceSpider to share this information with any third party, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by contacting PriceSpider at datapolicy@pricespider.com, or by modifying your browser settings to decline cookies altogether.
USE OF LOG FILES AND WEB BEACONS

This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help PriceSpider provide and improve our Service.
Further, PriceSpider may place web beacons in marketing emails that are sent to you. The web beacons notify PriceSpider when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of PriceSpider’s websites. Such tracking technologies are used to operate and improve our Services.
You have certain personal data rights, including to access what personal information we have about you, make corrections or updates to it, tell us to delete that data, or receive a portable copy of that information. To make such requests please contact PriceSpider at datapolicy@pricespider.com.
