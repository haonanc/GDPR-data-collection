Website Security
Please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody.  We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks.  When disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent.  In particular, while individual data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not.  A third party may therefore be able to trace an existing bank account or relationship or one that is subsequently created.  Even if both the sender and recipient are located in the same country data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including to countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your country of domicile.
Password-protected areas of the Website can be accessed only with a valid user name and password.  Each password owner is responsible for keeping the password confidential and safe, as Hollar has no control or responsibility for this type of User information.  If the password may have been stolen or might otherwise be misused, it is the responsibility of the password owner to notify Hollar immediately for further action.
Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your Personal Information or data during its transfer via Internet.  Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.
International Users
The Website and the Service are exclusively hosted in the United States.  If you are a User accessing the Website or the Service from the European Union, Australia, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as such other regions.  User information (including Personal Information or “personal data” as defined by foreign laws) collected through the Website or the Service may be stored and processed in the United States, and by using the Website or the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your home country.

Inviting Friends and Earning Referral Credit
When you invite a friend to register for an account at Hollar.com, you and your friend will both receive a $2 Referral Credit for each friend who makes a qualified first purchase. Your friend must be a new member of Hollar (this offer excludes returning or existing members) and live in a different household
You will only receive a Referral Credit for your friend's first qualified purchase if the purchase was a result of an invite from you via an authorized referral method. If your friend does not click on the personal referral link in their invite email or other invite mechanism to accept your invitation, you may not receive a Referral Credit and we will have no liability to you because there is no discernible way to identify that the purchase resulted from your referral.
A qualified purchase is considered a member’s first Hollar purchase. You may earn a maximum $50 in Referral Credits per calendar year. You can track your Referral Credits by visiting the Refer-a-Friend section in My Account.
If two people refer the same friend, the friend who sent the link that is used to create the new member's account will be considered the referring friend, regardless of which link was sent to the new member first. There is a limit of one Referral Credit per new email address that is registered on Hollar.com.
You may not use spam or send unsolicited emails to people you don't personally know to collect Referral Credits and you may not collect Referral Credits by posting on message boards or other online venues in violation of such venues' terms of use.
See the Privacy Policy for how information is stored.
Spending Referral Credit
Referral Credits are valid for 3 months from issuance. Your Referral Credits are automatically applied to your purchases at checkout in the order in which they expire (i.e., first to expire will be applied first).
You can check the amount of Referral Credits you have earned and their associated expiration dates at any time by visiting the Refer-a-Friend section in My Account.
Prohibitions and Cancellation
Referral Credits are issued to a single Hollar.com account holder at our discretion and cannot be transferred between accounts or between users. Credits cannot be bartered, exchanged, or sold.
Referral Credits are a promotional offer and are not a payment instruments. Referral Credits are issued without any exchange of money or value from you and you have no vested property right or interest in them.
Referral Credits have no cash value by themselves; they are only deemed to have a notional cash value of $2 if they are used in connection with an eligible purchase on our site.
We reserve the right to limit or cancel your Referral Credits in our sole discretion if we determine that you have violated these Terms of Service, including through fraudulent or misleading referral activity (for example, by inviting fake people to join Hollar, using false names, using multiple email accounts or email addresses, impersonating another person or otherwise providing false or misleading information to us) or if we terminate your account for any reason. You may also be liable for civil and/or criminal penalties under applicable law.

Resolution of Disputes – Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
We offer the following process to help you resolve a complaint or Dispute (as defined below) that you may have with Hollar, any goods sold via the Website, or use of this Website. Please read this section carefully. Our Customer Service Department, which you can reach at support@hollar.com , can help you resolve most of your concerns. If our Customer Service Department is unable to resolve your complaint or Dispute, you agree to take the following steps to resolve any Dispute you may have with us.
Step 1. Notice of Dispute
You must first try to resolve any complaint or Dispute with us through our Notice of Dispute process. You begin by submitting a “Notice of Dispute” with any supporting documents or other information by U. S. Mail to:
Hollar Inc.
Commerce, CA 90040
A “Notice of Dispute” is a written form in which you provide your name, address, contact information, email address, the facts regarding your Dispute, and the relief you are requesting from us. Once we receive your Notice of Dispute, you and we will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within forty-five (45) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is received by us. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or we may initiate an arbitration proceeding or small claims action as described below.
You agree that the term “Dispute” in this Agreement will have the broadest meaning possible. It applies to any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and us relating to the Website, any goods offered or purchased from us, any transaction or relationship between us resulting from your use of the Website or purchase of any goods from us, communications between us, the purchase/order/use of goods from the Website, or this Agreement – whether in contract, warranty, tort, laws or regulation. The term also applies to any dispute over the validity, enforceability, or scope of this arbitration provision.
Step 2: Arbitration
If your Dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 45 days from when we received your Notice of Dispute, you and we agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us. As we explain below, you and we also may also have the right to bring an individual action before a Small Claims Court for certain claims. You agree that arbitration or a small claims action will be your sole and exclusive remedy to resolve any dispute with us. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Agreement.
By agreeing to arbitrate, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) any and all Disputes in a court before a judge or jury (except Small Claims Court). Instead, a neutral arbitrator will resolve all Disputes.
To read more about arbitration, visit www.adr.org . The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct any arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at that time. You can review the Consumer Arbitration Rules here. You may begin an arbitration with us by completing a Demand for Arbitration form, available by clicking here. The completed form(s) should be returned directly to the AAA. The AAA will assign someone to manage your case. You will be contacted with instructions for continuing the arbitration process. Be sure to keep a copy of everything you send to the administrator of your arbitration or us. If, for any reason, the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum which will be governed by the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA rules will determine whether the arbitration will take place through written submissions by you and us, by telephone, or in person.
Class Action Waiver
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, consolidation of your Dispute with other arbitrations, or any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity or as a private attorney general are not permitted and are waived by you, and an arbitrator will have no jurisdiction to hear such claims. If a court or arbitrator finds that the class action waiver in this section is unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then the class action waiver will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of this Dispute resolution section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.
Costs
If you initiate an arbitration with the AAA, we will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee you may have been required to pay by the AAA, once you have notified us in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration demand. However, if we are the prevailing party in the arbitration, we will be entitled to seek and recover our attorneys’ fees and costs, subject to the arbitrator’s determination and applicable law.
Small Claims Option
You may also litigate any Dispute in Small Claims Court in the County of Los Angeles, California, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You can learn more about the Small Claims Court in the County of Los Angeles by clicking here. However, if you initiate a Small Claims case, you are responsible for all your court costs.
Choice of Law and Forum Selection
You agree that the laws of the State of California govern this agreement and any claim or Dispute or issues arising from it, without regard to California’s conflict of laws rules.
Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or Dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any Disputes or claims that you may have against us reside in and will be resolved by a state or federal court located in Los Angeles County in the State of California and you agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.
Notice for Users in California
