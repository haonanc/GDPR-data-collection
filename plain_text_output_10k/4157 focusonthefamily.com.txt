Some Focus Services permit or require you to create an account to participate or to secure additional benefits.  You agree to provide and maintain accurate, current and complete information, including your contact information for notices and other communications from us and your payment information.  You agree not to impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity, including using another person’s username, password or other account information, or another person’s name or likeness, or provide false details for a parent or guardian.  You agree that we may take steps to verify the accuracy of information you provide, including contact information for a parent or guardian.

4. Paid Transactions
Identity of Seller
Focus uses a third-party vendor to transact sales on the Focus Services. 
Subscriptions
Some Focus Services require paid subscriptions to access.  By signing up for a subscription, you agree that your subscription will be automatically renewed.  Unless you cancel your subscription, you authorize us to charge your payment method for the renewal term.  The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of sale.  The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal.  You must cancel your subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to you for the particular Focus Service.  We will not refund fees that may have accrued to your account and will not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.  From time to time, we may offer a free trial subscription for a Focus Service.  If you register for a free trial subscription, we will begin to bill your account when the free trial subscription expires, unless you cancel your subscription before that time.
The Order Process
You will have the opportunity to review and confirm your order, including delivery address (if applicable), payment method and product details.  We will send to you a notice when we accept your order and our acceptance will be deemed complete and for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to you at the time we send the notice.  At such time, the contract for sale will be made and become binding on both you and us.  The risk of loss in any goods you purchase and the responsibility to insure them passes to you when the relevant goods are delivered.
We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order prior to delivery.  Some situations that may result in your order being cancelled include system or typographical errors, inaccuracies in product or pricing information or product availability, fairness among customers where supplies are limited, or problems identified by our credit or fraud departments.  We also may require additional verification or information before accepting an order.  We will contact you if any portion of your order is cancelled or if additional information is required to accept your order.  If your order is cancelled after we have processed your payment but prior to delivery, we will refund your payment.
Payments and Billing
When you provide payment information, you represent and warrant that the information is accurate, that you are authorized to use the payment method provided, and that you will notify us of changes to the payment information.  We reserve the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards.  If you use a payment method other than a credit card, you may incur an additional payment processing fee and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.
Right of Cancellation
When you subscribe to a Focus Service, you have the right to withdraw from your contract within fourteen (14) days after your receipt and acceptance of these terms and you will receive a full refund of the subscription fee paid.  For semi-annual and annual subscriptions, if notice of cancellation is received within the first thirty (30) days following the first day of initial billing, you will receive a refund of the subscription fees paid but will still be obligated to pay other charges incurred.  Notices of withdrawal or cancellation must be in writing and delivered to the address provided in connection with the relevant Focus Service.
All license purchase fees are non-refundable.  When purchasing a license to access digital content or virtual items, you agree that you are not entitled to a cancellation or cooling-off period and that the license purchase becomes final when you receive delivery of or otherwise access such content.
Right of Return
You have the right, within thirty (30) days from the date of your receipt of the relevant goods, to cancel our contract with you and return the goods.  This right does not apply to digital content, virtual items or products stated by us on the Focus Services to be non-returnable, including audio and video recordings, computer software, and CD’s, DVD’s or other physical media that have been unsealed.
Pricing; Taxes
We may revise the pricing for products and services we offer.  If you pay a periodic subscription fee for a Focus Service, we will provide you with reasonable notice of changes to the fees or billing methods in advance of their effective date and you will be able to cancel your subscription prior to such change.  When you place your order, we estimate the tax and include that estimate in the total for your convenience.  The actual tax amount that will be applied to your order and charged to your payment method is based on calculations on the date of shipment, regardless of when the order was placed.
5. Competitions
Competitions that you enter on a Focus Service may have supplemental rules and conditions, but the following general rules apply absent contrary terms in any supplemental rules or conditions for the competition.
Entries
Your competition entry is User Generated Content and subject to all provisions of these terms that govern your submission and our use of your User Generated Content.  We may disqualify entries that are late, misdirected, incomplete, corrupted, lost, illegible or invalid or where appropriate parental authorization was not provided.  Competition entries are limited to one per person and entries via agents or third parties or the use of multiple identities are not permitted.  Use of automated entries, votes or other programs is prohibited and all such entries (or votes) will be disqualified.
We reserve the right to modify, suspend, cancel or terminate a competition or extend or resume the entry period or disqualify any participant or entry at any time without giving advance notice.  We will do so if it cannot be guaranteed the competition can be carried out fairly or correctly for technical, legal or other reasons, or if we suspect that any person has manipulated entries or results, provided false information, or acted unethically.  If we cancel or terminate a competition, prizes may be awarded in any manner we deem fair and appropriate consistent with local laws governing the competition.
Eligibility
To enter a competition, you must be a registered user of the Focus Services.  In some cases, you may be required to have an active account with current contact information.  No purchase is necessary to enter a competition and a purchase will not improve your chances of winning.  Competitions are not open to our employees (or their immediate families) or anyone else professionally associated with the competition.  If you are under age 18 (or the age of majority under applicable law) and the competition is open to you, we may need your parent or guardian’s permission before we can accept your entry.  We reserve the right to request proof of identity or to verify eligibility conditions and potential winning entries, and to award any prize to a winner in person.  Competitions are void where prohibited or restricted by law.  Potential winners who are residents in jurisdictions where competitions require an element of skill may be required to answer a mathematical test in order to be eligible to win a prize.
Prizes
No cash or alternative prizes are available, except that we (or the party providing a prize) reserve the right to substitute a similar prize of equal or greater value.  Prizes cannot be transferred (except to a child or other family member) or sold by winners.  Only the number of prizes stated for the competition are available to be won and all prizes will be awarded provided a sufficient number of eligible entries are received and prizes are validly claimed by the date provided in connection with the competition, after which no alternate winners will be selected or unclaimed prizes awarded.  Unless otherwise disclosed in the prize description prior to entry, winners are responsible for all costs and expenses associated with claiming a prize.  All taxes are solely the responsibility of each winner, although we reserve the right to withhold applicable taxes and each winner agrees to complete any required tax forms.
Your acceptance of a prize constitutes agreement to participate in reasonable publicity related to the competition and grants us an unconditional right to us to use your name, town or city and state, province or country, likeness, prize information and statements by you about the competition for publicity, advertising and promotional purposes and to comply with applicable law and regulations, all without additional permission or compensation.  As a condition of receiving a prize, winners (or their parents or guardians) may be required to sign and return an affidavit of eligibility, liability release and publicity release.
6. Additional Provisions
Submissions and Unsolicited Ideas Policies
Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider unsolicited creative ideas, suggestions or materials.  In connection with anything you submit to us – whether or not solicited by us – you agree that creative ideas, suggestions or other materials you submit are not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of review, compensation or consideration of any type.
Claims of Copyright Infringement 
Notifications of claimed copyright infringement and counter notices must be sent to our designated agent:
Legal Department
We are only able to accept notices in the English language.
We will respond to claims of copyright infringement committed using the Focus Services that are reported to our Designated Copyright Agent, identified above, in accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (“DMCA”) or, as applicable, other laws.  With respect to Focus Services hosted in the United States, these notices must include the required information set forth in the DMCA and described in detail  here .
Choice of Forum
You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms or the Focus Services shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the state or federal courts located in Colorado, United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action.
Choice of Law
These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.
Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
You and Focus agree to arbitrate all disputes between you and Focus on the Family or its affiliates, except disputes relating to the enforcement of Focus on the Family or its affiliates’ intellectual property rights.  “Dispute” includes any dispute, action or other controversy between you and us concerning the Focus Services or these terms, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute or regulation, or other legal or equitable basis.
In the event of a dispute, you or Focus must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.  You must send any notice of dispute to Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Drive, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80920, USA, and Attention: Legal Department/Arbitration Notice.  We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.  You and Focus will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent.  After sixty (60) days, you or we may commence arbitration.  You may also litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.
If you and Focus do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act.  YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.  Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.  For more information, visit www.adr.org or, in the United States, call 800-778-7879.  Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.  The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, Focus will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.  If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then we will pay you the amount of the award or US $1,000, whichever is greater, and pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys’ fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrue for investigating, preparing and pursuing your claim in arbitration.  We waive any right to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any non-frivolous arbitration between you and us.
If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in El Paso County, Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States of America, and you and Focus agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located there, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.  Neither you nor Focus will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.  No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding.  If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.
Severability
If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
Survival
The provisions of these terms which by their nature should survive the termination of these terms shall survive such termination.
Waiver
No waiver of any provision of these terms by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

POSTING GUIDELINES
Last Updated: March 2015
Focus on the Family (hereinafter, "Focus") websites are based on a set of foundational Christian beliefs. We make no apologies for holding a Judeo-Christian perspective of marriage, family and the value of life and children. Thanks for your openness to respectfully consider our viewpoints. To find out more about our organization, please visit  About Us .
PLEASE READ THESE POSTING GUIDELINES CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR SITES. By posting any content to a Focus site, you signify your assent to these guidelines. If you do not agree with any part of the following guidelines, do not post to our sites. These Posting Guidelines may be updated from time to time without notice to you. Focus may republish any material contributed by our users. By posting a message, users expressly grant Focus the right to republish or sell the posted content as part of any edited compilation.
1. POSTING RULES AND ONLINE ETIQUETTE.
As our online communities have developed, we've discovered a need to establish guidelines for posting user-generated content to our sites. You are solely responsible for the content or information you publish or display (hereinafter, "post") on any of our sites, or transmit to other users. Users may be held legally responsible for copyright infringement, defamation or invasion of privacy, as well as any damages arising out of actions resulting from materials submitted by them and posted by Focus. By using our sites, you agree to adhere to the following rules:
In an effort to foster civil discourse, community users are required to communicate with the respect, love, and understanding that Christ would expect from all of us. Therefore, refrain from addressing topics that you would not be willing to bring up with a close, Christian friend or mentor and strive to maintain a tone like that you would use when speaking to a valued friend.
No strong, vulgar, graphic, obscene, racial, or otherwise harmful or derogatory language is permitted. When posting about sexual matters, comments should be discreet, appropriate, and not overly detailed.
No harassing, intimidating, stalking, or threatening other Focus users.
No libelous, defamatory, or slanderous language aimed at other users or members of your family. It's important that our online community uphold the sanctity of the marriage relationship and foster respect among family members.
No impersonating any person, including, but not limited to, other Focus users or employees of Focus.
No invasion of another's privacy.
No actions that are harmful to minors.
No posting, distributing, transmitting, or promoting illegal content.
No posting, providing, transmitting, or otherwise making available any information that you do not have a right to make available due to contract, fiduciary duty, or operation of law (such as inside, proprietary or confidential information).
No posting, providing, transmitting, or otherwise making available any junk mail or spam.
No posting, uploading, emailing, or otherwise transmitting any material that contains any malicious computer code (including spyware, worms, Trojan horses, viruses, malware, etc.).
No off-topic posts that go outside the scope of, or move the conversation away from, the original intent of the blog or forum.
No discussion of medical or legal topics that should be handled in a professional setting.
No photos, videos, surveys, solicitations, personal research, soliciting or marketing are permitted.
No extended or disrespectful debates between users.
No links from Focus sites to other websites unless such other websites are related to the topic being discussed.
No posting of any material that is copyright protected without written permission from the copyright owner. You are responsible for ensuring that your message or posting does not violate any existing copyrights.
No posting of any personal information, including but not limited to your date of birth, street address, email address, or any other information that might allow others improper access to you or your family, or to impact the security of your identity.
No collecting, storing, or posting of personal data about or of other community members.
No posting of comments that refer specifically to any current political candidate, or any measure on or being considered for, a current ballot – at any level of local, state, or federal government. Focus is a non-profit entity qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, cannot take a position on specific votes or display on our sites any statements related to specific voting positions. In addition, we cannot discuss or permit posts of personal viewpoints on political candidates or ballot measures. Any posts that violate these rules will be removed
2. RELIANCE ON POSTED INFORMATION.
The opinions, ideas, views and recommendations expressed on any of the blogs or forums hosted by Focus do not necessarily represent those of Focus. Therefore, we encourage you to be discerning and wise when reading the comments posted by other users. Focus is not and will not be responsible for any misleading, false, or otherwise injurious information and advice communicated on forums or blogs hosted by Focus, or for any results obtained from the use of such information or advice. Focus will not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by a user through the user's reliance on information and advice gained from forums or blogs hosted by Focus.
3. USER SAFETY.
Please be aware that many of the blogs on the Focus websites will display the user's first and last name in association with any post.  However, Focus is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users. As stated above, please refrain from posting any personal information to any Focus site. In order to protect your safety and the safety of your family, Focus may delete in their entirety any posts containing any such personal information. As an additional measure to provide safety to our online community, we will not facilitate or allow private contacts between users.
4. MODERATING.
Focus may, but has no obligation, to monitor the materials posted to Focus sites. Notwithstanding this right, you remain solely responsible for the content of the materials you post to any Focus site. Once a post is submitted, it may be reviewed by Focus staff moderators for content, length, privacy, appropriateness, and/or the use of any personal information, and removed. Focus may contact or respond to users individually regarding the nature or content of their posts. In addition, Focus may remove and delete in their entirety any posts that violate the law or these Posting Guidelines, or for any other reason in Focus' sole discretion. Focus may close any conversation by locking the thread.
5. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER FOCUS POLICIES.
