Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of our website or about a group or category of services or Users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

The term “Service(s)” means the services Tuesday Morning offers through TuesdayMorning.com and related websites, mobile applications, and other platforms that enable Users to access and use content made available by Tuesday Morning about its stores, its business and operations, the goods and services it offers for sale, promotional materials, employment opportunities, various interactive features that may be made available to Users from time to time, and other important information and functionality, some or all of which may be made available to the general public or only to registered Users of Tuesday Morning’s website(s).
It is important to us that you understand how Tuesday Morning works and how we use the information you provide. By using Tuesday Morning, including services available at one or more Tuesday Morning domains, such as TuesdayMorning.com, Users agree to be bound by this Policy and Tuesday Morning’s Terms of Use.

Information Collection
General
We collect personal information about our Users because it helps us deliver the best User experience we can provide. Gathering information enables us to provide convenient and accurate information about our goods and services offered in our stores and other content that may interest you, and to deliver timely and relevant information about various Tuesday Morning website Services that you may choose to use. Such practices also help us refine the product experience over time so that we may optimize our Services based on User feedback and actual use. In addition, this information helps us keep you informed about the latest Tuesday Morning announcements, updates, and support information in a timely fashion.
Some information may be gathered by passive means, such as the use of cookies and log files (as described below), and will apply to all Users regardless of whether the User has completed a registration with Tuesday Morning. In addition to the information gathered through passive means, if you register for an account on a Tuesday Morning website, other information, including personal information, will be gathered from the registration and profile information you submit and from other active means as you use the website(s) and Services. Our gathering of personal information from registered Users may enable additional website functionality and help connect you with other registered Users.
Registration
When you sign up for a Tuesday Morning account, we will collect personal information such as your name, email address, street address, zip code, User identifier, and password. You must provide this information to register. Like all other passwords you create, you should choose a Tuesday Morning password that is known only by you. You acknowledge that the registration information is personal to you, and by creating an account on Tuesday Morning, you allow others, including Tuesday Morning, to identify you.
By registering for a User account on TuesdayMorning.com, you voluntarily and willingly provide us certain information, including personal information, which we collect in order to provide our Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us, having your information displayed on the TuesdayMorning.com domain, or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Policy or the Terms of Use, you should not register for a Tuesday Morning account. If you already are a registered User and have any reservations about using Tuesday Morning, you should close your account.

Once you become a User, you may provide additional User profile information, which may include personal information. Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you. Any information you provide at registration or in other sections may be used by Tuesday Morning as described in this Policy and in the Terms of Use.

Like most websites, Tuesday Morning uses cookies, web log files, or related technologies to track site usage and trends, improve the quality of our Service, customize your experience on Tuesday Morning’s website and through its Services, and deliver third-party advertising to Users both on and off the Tuesday Morning website. A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, which allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the Tuesday Morning website using the same computer and web browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note, however, that if you decline to allow cookies in your browser, some or all of our features or Services may not function properly as a result. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing the Services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. Tuesday Morning does not store unencrypted personal information in the cookies.
Log Files, IP Addresses, and Computer or Mobile Information
When you visit the TuesdayMorning.com domain we may log your IP address, access URL, time of access, browser type, and referral URL in order to provide us with internal information regarding site traffic statistics. This information may also be used to identify Users who are using the service for activity that is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Use. This information is used in the aggregate, and is never linked back to any personal information, except as otherwise described herein.
Information Security
We store all User information in secure databases protected via a variety of industry-standard access controls.

We employ these measures to ensure this data is accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement. When we use third parties to assist us, we require that they comply with all the same confidentiality and security measures.
