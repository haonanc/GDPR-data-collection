General Data Protection Regulation
On May 25, 2018, the European Union’s  General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) becomes officially operative. General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is a European Union law governing privacy and data protection for all residents of the EU. The provisions of GDPR can be also applied to how data is processed and verified outside the European Union.
GDPR is intended to empower the citizens of the European Union to control their personal information. In accordance with the applicable laws, users are authorized to access and modify their own data held by the companies, which includes data collection, ad tracking, surveys, cookies, location data, and every other bit of a user’s “digital footprint”. Users are also entitled to transmit their personal details to other organizations. The GDPR also enforces companies to determine their in-house data security policies.
We maintain our commitment to protect the privacy of our users and abide by the legislation of all regions we operate in, including compliance with the GDPR.
Taking into account the above, personal data (if any) of our users is processed under the “purposes of legitimate interests” as outlined in  GDPR Article 6(1)(f) . Such an approach also helps us to fight against fraud and reimburse our contractors and agents. In accordance with the GDPR requirements, we will strive to, at any time, (i) streamline the data handling controls, (ii) specify our relationships with data partners, and (iii) provide the data subjects with an understanding and direct management of the way their personal information is used.
GDPR measures
Controller Classification: 
As a Processor by the classifications of GDPR, we cooperate with our partners (Data Controllers and other Data Processors) to make sure any kind of user data is handled under the agreed terms and in compliance with the pertinent regulations.
As a Controller by the classification of GDPR, we have the appropriate technical and organizational measures in place ensuring that data processing is performed in accordance with GDPR. Such measures will be reviewed and updated if necessary and in accordance with the specifics of the gathered data.
Data Security: We have assigned a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who can be contacted at dpo@clickdealer.com.
Personal Information: Personal information will be pseudonymized and encrypted to ensure the user privacy. The collected information will be handled for standard cases of use described in this Privacy Policy.
Sub-Processors: We will, to the best of our ability, make sure that our sub-processors operate in full accordance with GDPR requirements before starting cooperation with them and require such sub-processors to comply with this Privacy Policy and maintain appropriate security to protect user information from unauthorized access or processing, unless we have no ability to do so (for example, where we are sharing information with regulatory authorities or courts). Nevertheless, we cannot be held responsible or liable for the use of any information that a sub-processor may execute, or that is gathered by sub-processors. Whenever applicable, users should acquaint themselves with Privacy Policies of any of the involved sub-processors’ websites.
Data Retention: We will retain the gathered data for the period of the cooperation, but in no case longer than the maximum allowed by the existing legislation, unless you choose to withdraw it yourself.
