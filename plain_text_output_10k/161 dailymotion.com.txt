We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the     Dailymotion Service or transacting business with us.

1. DATA WE COLLECT
1.1. In General. We may collect personal information that can identify you directly, such     as your name and email address, and other information that does not     identify you directly. When you provide personal information through our     website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United     States, France, and other countries around the world. This Section explains     what personal information we collect and how we collect such information.

1.3.a. Data You Provide To Us. We collect personal information you provide to us when you interact with     the Dailymotion Service, including when you sign up for an account, upload     Content, create a playlist or share a playlist with others.

1.3.b. Usage and Log Data. We collect information when you use the Dailymotion Service or view     Dailymotion advertising outside of the Dailymotion Service. We may also     collect information from or about the computers, phones, tablets, or other     devices where you install or access the Dailymotion Service, depending on     the permissions you've granted.

We may combine the information we collect from or about you and use it in     the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by     law.
1.4. How the Data Is Collected.
1.4.a. Data Collected through Cookies and Similar Technologies. Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage     data and store preferences. The data collected helps us to propose, protect     and improve the Dailymotion Service as well as to personalize your user     experience by adapting the Content and advertising to your taste. The     technologies we use are discussed below.
Cookies and Local Storage. One technology we     use is called a cookie, a small data file that is transferred to your     computer’s hard disk. We may use both session cookies and persistent     cookies to better understand how you interact with the Dailymotion Service     or Dailymotion advertising published outside of the Dailymotion Service; to     monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the     Dailymotion Service; and to customize Content and advertising. We may     create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we     can customize your experience based on your preferences. These uses allow     us to create a better experience for you on the Dailymotion Service. For     further information on Dailymotion’s cookie management policy, please read     out Cookie Policy available here. You may also decide to manage your cookie settings at any time by     indicating which types of cookies you accept or refuse to receive by     clicking on the cookie management page available at all times on the     Dailymotion Service.
We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also     referred to as "Flash cookies") and HTML5 local storage,     including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the     Video Player. Since these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they     are sometimes referred to as "browser cookies" even though they may be     stored in different parts of your computer.
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. By changing your     browser settings, you can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies     or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. For     further information on disabling cookies or deleting information contained     in cookies in general, please click here .     Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in     cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of     the Dailymotion Service, including the Video Player. For example, we may     not be able to store your preferences or login information or customize the     Content and advertising to your viewing habits.
Web Beacons or Pixels. In addition to     cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags,     which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails. Web beacons or pixel     tags are used to collect certain types of information from your browser or     device; check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email     message; and determine other usage details including: the time and date on     which you viewed Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of     the web page from which the Content was viewed.
Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits ("SDKs"). We may use or work with third parties, including our business partners and     service providers, who use mobile SDKs to collect information such as     advertising identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA") and information related     to how mobile devices interact with the Dailymotion Service. An SDK is     computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads     to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to     be implemented (a mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel     tag or beacon, described above). For instance, we may use this technology     to analyze how you interact with Content and advertisements and to enable     analytics or other features through mobile devices.
o The uses of these various technologies, notably in connection with     advertising on the Dailymotion Service, are explained further below.
2. PURPOSE FOR COLLECTING THIS DATA
We collect Data because we are passionate about creating customized and     engaging experiences for our users.

For example, we collect your authentication     data to allow you to connect to your account, and we collect information on     your language setting preferences to provide you with the Dailymotion     Service in the language of your choice. We may conduct surveys and     research, test features in development and analyze the information that we     have in order to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new     products or features and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.
2.2. Communicate with You. We may use your information to send you marketing communications,     communicate with you about the Dailymotion Service and update you about our     policies and terms. We also may use your information to respond to you when     you contact us, or for any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the     time we collect the Data or that is related to a request made by you.

2.5. Use of Precise Location Data. In order to access certain services from your mobile device, you may be     required to share with us your device’s location data (limited to the city     level only). In addition to providing you with certain services, this also     enables us to serve you Content related to your local area such as local     news and sports videos, or to ensure the respect of Content     geo-restrictions dictated by the Content uploader. This data may also be     used to tailor advertising to you based on your location.

In addition to any personally identifiable data use that is described in     this Privacy Policy, we may aggregate information about you and other     individuals together, or otherwise "de-identify" the Data about you     (meaning that the Data is anonymized and aggregated so it no longer     personally identifies you). We may use this “de-identified” information for     any legitimate internal and external business purpose, including for     research and analysis, administration of the Dailymotion Service,     advertising (e.g. improving our targeting efforts), and business     promotional purposes.
2.7. Ensure Safety and Security. We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to     promote safety and security on and off our Services, such as by     investigating suspicious activity or violations of our legal terms and     policies. We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers,     automated systems and advanced technology such as encryption and machine     learning.
3. DATA RECIPIENTS

We may work with service providers     who use information collected from or about you to help us identify the     browsers and devices you use for various purposes: including for targeted     advertising, analytics, attribution, and measurement purposes.

This information includes Data on your online     activities in relation to your use of the Dailymotion Service, such as the     websites you have visited and advertisements you have viewed. For example,     we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed     their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally     identifying demographic information (such as 25-year-old female, in New     York) to these advertisers to help them understand their audience or     customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by our Privacy     Policy and strict confidentiality obligations. Please also note: we do not     share directly identifiable information about you with advertisers and     advertising-related service providers unless you give us express     permission.
3.5. Audience Measurement Providers. Our business partners, such as content programmers, as well as our     advertisers, seek to measure the performance of their creative material     across many platforms, including the Dailymotion Service. Accordingly,     Dailymotion may permit the use of third-party measurement software that     enables third parties (e.g., Nielsen or comScore) to include your Content     views on the Dailymotion Service in calculating measurement statistics. To     learn more about your choices with respect to audience measurement     software, please see the Data we have provided in Section 8 ("Your Rights & Opting-Out ").

In some instances, we may be required to disclose information from or about     you without providing you with notice or giving you the opportunity to     consent. For example, we may disclose your information in good-faith in the     following ways: to protect the legal rights of Dailymotion and our     affiliates or partners, and each of our respective equity holders,     directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners; to protect     the safety and security of users of the Dailymotion Service or third parties; to enforce our Terms of Use ; to protect     against fraud; for risk management purposes; and to comply with or respond     to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government     entity. However, it is Dailymotion’s policy, whenever reasonably possible     and legally permissible, to promptly notify you upon receipt of a subpoena     or court order requesting your Data and to not produce your Data until     after receipt of such subpoena or court order, so that you will have     adequate opportunity to move to quash this request in court. Furthermore,     if you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by     Dailymotion or another user of the Dailymotion Service, we may provide the     Data that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is     necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint.

If we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or     otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the     event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information from or about you to one     or more third parties as part of the transaction, including as part of the due diligence process. Please note that in such a case your Data would be     shared only as an integral part of the Dailymotion Service and not sold or     transferred separately from the Service to third parties.

4. DATA SECURITY AND ACCOUNT ACCESS
4.1. Data Security. Dailymotion attaches great importance to the security of your Data and     takes all appropriate steps to limit the risk that it may be lost, damaged     or misused. Our aim is to make you feel confident and safe when using the     Dailymotion Service.
We use a variety of physical, technical, and administrative measures to     safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and     unauthorized use, disclosure, and modification. For example, we take steps     to limit access to sensitive information from or about you to only those     Dailymotion employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate     business reason to access such information. We also use measures like     encryption and hashing to help protect sensitive information when in     transmission, and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from     gaining access to your personal information. We also use techniques such as     data aggregation to render it more difficult to link and trace information     to you.
Despite these efforts, in today’s world there is always a possibility that     a breach in data transmission or storage may occur. We want you to feel     confident in our security when using the Dailymotion Service, but we cannot     guarantee the security of any information from or about you 100% of the     time.
4.2. Account Access. If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and     update your personal information online by logging into your account. You     can also review and update your personal information either by accessing     your account or by contacting us. More information about how to contact us     is provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
Please note that if you allow others to use your account (including others     you permit to set up profiles under your account), they may be able to view     information about your account or any of the profiles under your account,     including information about the videos you view and your email address. You     should take care of how you handle and disclose your personal information     and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.     Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at     https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/privacy-identity-online-security for     further information on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

Information associated with your account will be     kept for a period of one year following the deletion of your account, or     earlier if we no longer need the data to provide our products and services.     After that point, data is kept only for statistical purposes (or as     otherwise legally permitted) and shall not be used for any other reason.     Please note that you may always exercise your right to erase your personal     data stored in our system.
