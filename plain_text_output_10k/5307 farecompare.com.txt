How we help protect your user information
FareCompare has security features to help protect the personal information we collect.

We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information.
Children’s Privacy
This website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect information about children. Should a child whom we know to be under 13 send personal information to us, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personal information.
