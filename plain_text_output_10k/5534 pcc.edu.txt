PCC Board Policy
The PCC district shall follow all applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations      that apply to student records. All information contained in the college records      which is personally identifiable to any student shall be kept confidential and      not released except upon prior written consent of the subject student or upon      the lawful subpoena or other order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Student      information may be shared among college faculty and staff on an official "need to know" basis.      ( Policy     B 407 )
Confidentiality
Students      have certain rights with respect to student records under Public Law 93-380. These include:
The right to inspect the educational records of the student.
The right to challenge the accuracy        of the records if they are believed to be misleading or to violate privacy          or other rights of the student.
Except as may be provided by law, the right to prevent the release of any or all information       from the records to any other party. The college will not send transcript or copies of other       educational records to any other school, prospective employer or other person without written       request of the student.
Solomon Act
Federal law requires PCC to provide student name, address and telephone number to the military      for recruiting purposes. If you would like your name withheld, call the Registration        Office at 971-722-8888.
Privacy Rights of Student Educational Records
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (Statute: 20 U.S.C. 1232g; Regulations:      34CFR Part 99) also known as the Buckley Amendment is a Federal Law which states (a) that a      written institutional policy must be established and (b) that a statement of adopted procedures      covering the privacy rights of students be made available. The law provides that the institution     will maintain the confidentiality of student education records.
Educational Records Policy
The Family Educational rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights regarding     their educational records. They are:
The right to inspect and review the student's records. The student may request to        review their records by submitting a written request to the Records      Office or other school official having custody of such records;
The right to seek amendment        of the student's records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading,          or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights. Requests for amendment      of records must be in writing and must describe the specific portions or specific      record(s) the student wishes to have amended, instructions as to the change desired, and reasons       why the change is justified;
The right to consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information        contained in the student's education records, except for when consent is       not required by FERPA. FERPA does not require a student's consent when disclosure       is to other school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person       employed by the college in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support       staff position; a person or company with whom the college has contracted or appointed as its       agent; or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official in       performing the official's tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if       the official needs to review an educational record in order to fulfill their professional       responsibilities.
The right to file a complaint with the Department of Education, Family Compliance       Office, concerning alleged failures by the college to comply with the       requirements of FERPA.   Written complaints  should be directed to: The Family       Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 500 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington,       D.C. 20202-5920.
Note: FERPA rights belong to the PCC student, regardless of the student's age.
Note: While PCC does not have any directory information, the college may contact a student via the phone and mailing address provided by the student, and may leave a voice mail at the provided number.
