This Privacy Policy describes how TunnelBear LLC. ("TunnelBear") handles your Personal Data when you use our services ("Services").
By using our Services and/or registering for an account, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service , which are integrated here by reference.
TunnelBear is a global company. Although our physical servers are located in many different countries around the world, TunnelBear does not store Personal Data outside of Canada's physical borders. By using our services, you authorize TunnelBear to use your information according to Canada's laws, regardless of which country you are located in.
If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: privacy (at) tunnelbear.com
As a provider of an online privacy service, we ultimately strive to collect the minimal amount of information required to operate our service. This often means difficult trade-offs between the information we collect and the performance of our service.
We believe in an open dialogue because this Privacy Policy is an evolving document. We welcome your thoughts and feedback on how we're doing.
As described below, "Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("Individual") and includes information provided by you while using our Services. If we use or store Personal Data with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as Personal Data.
We strive to collect the minimum amount of information required to operate our service.
Account Data
Email address
Twitter ID (optional)
Email confirmed
Paid user
Paid user expiry date
Example Trade-off: Collecting your name
TunnelBear previously collected your full name as part of the account creation process. Having your full name allowed us to personalize communications and customer support. However, through TunnelBear's regular data privacy discussions, we decided that it was more important to protect privacy than to customize communications. As a result, we have deleted this data and you are now only required to provide your email address when creating a TunnelBear account.
If you pay for our services with a credit card, we do still collect your last name along with your payment information, see 1.4 Personal and Financial Data Collected at Payment for more details.
Operational Data
OS Version
TunnelBear App Version
Total data used this month
e.g. 22.34 GB
Customer satisfaction, support, network demand planning, granting free user data
Operational events
e.g. Created an account, complete Twitter bonus, made a payment
Troubleshooting account and payment related issues, these events are not related to the time and activity of VPN usage
Example Trade-off: Selecting an anonymous usage metric
Understanding how much data people are using is a critical metric for TunnelBear. It tells us if people are using TunnelBear, if people have reached their free data limit, if the service is working properly and it also helps us plan for demand on our network. However, choosing a usage metric that respects your privacy is challenging task. We decided that collecting the overall amount of data used by a specific user, for the current month, was the correct balance. We also ensure that no historical record is kept by resetting the total monthly usage value to 0 at the end of each month. We felt that overall usage would respect individual user privacy (i.e. no login timestamps, no logs, etc.) while still providing the most vital data for TunnelBear to efficiently operate our service.
Making a purchase with a credit card on any service will result in Personal Data being exchanged with payment processors. For an anonymous purchase experience, TunnelBear offers payment through Bitcoin. No information is collected or stored from Bitcoin transactions.
Credit Card Transactions
TunnelBear processes credit card payment information securely through Stripe and PayPal. Credit card processors may store Personal Data associated with financial transactions outside of Canada's borders.
When you pay with credit card, TunnelBear stores the following information:
Payment Data
Cardholder last name
Date of card use
Last four Numbers of Credit Card
e.g. 5555
For use in credit card fraud prevention
TunnelBear does not store, but can securely login and view the following information through our third party payment processors Stripe and PayPal:
Payment Data
Card billing address
Card expiry
Last four Numbers of Credit Card
For use in credit card fraud prevention
TunnelBear never stores your complete credit card number. To keep your payment information secure, we adopt all available security and multi-factor authentication measures available from these providers.
TunnelBear operates exclusively with PCI compliant payment processors. Only our payment processors have the ability to collect, use and access your full credit card information and other financial information. They can use this information solely for the purpose of charging and invoicing you for our (paid) Services.
Example Trade-off: Fighting Credit Card Fraud
No one likes credit card fraud. As a service that's serious about online privacy, TunnelBear can attract some dodgy characters that attempt to use stolen credit cards to purchase upgraded TunnelBear accounts. Despite trying a number of commercial solutions, credit card fraud became a significant enough problem that we built our own proprietary machine-learning anti-fraud solution.
To enhance the effectiveness of TunnelBear's anti-fraud tools, we sometimes store your Last Name and the last four numbers of your credit card (and only last 4 numbers) when you upgrade your TunnelBear.
This information is exclusively stored for the purposes of making the use of stolen credit cards to purchase TunnelBear as annoying as possible for thieves.
Some data is used to prevent purchase fraud.
