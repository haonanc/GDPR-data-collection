Privacy Policy
This policy describes Tripping.com's practices regarding personally identifiable information and data ("personal information"). This policy applies to our websites and social media accounts (the "Services"). When you use the Services, you agree to the terms in this policy.  Remember that your use of the Services is at all times subject to the Terms and Conditions , which incorporates this privacy policy.  Any terms we use in this privacy policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms and Conditions.
Information Overview
When you visit the Services, we may collect information about your visit. This information can include search history, IP address, screen resolution, browser used, operating system and settings, access times and referring URL. If you are using a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your device, your settings and your location. This is a standard practice for most websites and it enables us to provide higher quality service for our users.
If you inquire about an accommodation via the Services, we may request additional information from you, which may include your name, email address and telephone number.
In addition, we collect personal information from you, such as first and last name, date of birth, e-mail address, and password, when you register for our services. When registering, we may also collect financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address and credit card number. If you choose a third-party service, like Facebook Login, to register or login, you are permitting us to use and store certain profile information related to the third-party account, such as your name and contact information.
If you give us personal information, you are telling us that the information is true, accurate, complete and current. You are also telling us that you have the authorization to provide it to us.
How we collect your Personal Information
We collect your personal information directly from you and with your consent. For example, you may provide your personal information (such as your phone number) when you register with us or inquire about accommodations.
We also collect your personal information passively. For example, we collect anonymized information about you over time and across different Websites when you use the Services. We also use tracking tools like cookies and beacons. To learn more about these tools and how to control them, please see below.
How we use your Personal Information
There are several reasons as to why we may collect your personal information. More than anything, it's to provide excellent customer service and to consistently improve our Services and products. We may also collect it for the below reasons:
To allow you to register with, log-in, and use, our services.
To process your accommodation requests and inquiries.
To display more relevant advertising and recommendations, or suppress advertising and content that you might find irrelevant.
To contact you, including as follows:
To send confirmations that we've received your inquiries;
To get in touch if you contact us in connection with the Services;
To send you marketing emails from a Tripping.com address regarding our Services or those of our Partners, provided you have opted-in to receive emails from us or have transacted with us, and as permitted by law. (We hate spam so we'll always do our best to send emails that are targeted to your interests.)
Your Choices
Marketing email has an opt-out URL and you can unsubscribe from such communications at any time. You cannot unsubscribe from servicing emails and administrative messages that are considered part of your account membership, unless you cancel your membership. To change or modify your communication preferences please email support@tripping.com.
How we share your Personal Information
Your privacy is important to us and we will only share your personal information in connection with your use of the Services. With this in mind, we may share information with our corporate affiliates and with third parties for legitimate business purposes as permitted by law. For example, we may share your personal information with suppliers that perform services on our behalf. Unless we tell you differently, such suppliers do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
We may also share anonymous aggregated usage information with others.
In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. For example, if you inquire through the Services, we may share your personal information with the Partners and the accommodation owners you have inquired to regarding products or services such third parties make available via the Services. If you choose to engage in any business or take part in any transaction with such third parties,  the third parties will process your personal information in accordance with their own terms and conditions and privacy policies.  We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service with any such supplier or third party, please review all such parties' policies.
We may also share your information as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. For example, if you provide information to enter a sweepstakes, we may share your information with the promotional partners. We will disclose this in the terms of the sweepstakes so that you have the option to opt-out at any time.
If Tripping.com itself (or part of its business) is sold or otherwise changes control, the new owners may have access to your personal information for the uses set out herein.
We may disclose personal information if required by law, for example to law enforcement or other authorities. This includes court orders, subpoenas and orders arising from legal processes, and administrative or criminal investigations. We may also disclose your personal information if the disclosure is necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts or to prevent other damage, or in response to a legal action or to enforce our rights and claims.
How we store and protect your Personal Information
Our servers and data centers are located in the U.S, and our service providers may be located there and in other countries. By providing us personal information, you agree that your personal information may be transferred to and stored in these countries. These countries may have different and/or less stringent privacy/data protection and data security rules than those of your own country. As a result, your personal information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in those countries according to laws in those countries. Subject to the applicable laws in such other countries, we will provide the necessary safeguards to maintain protections of your personal information, e.g. by obtaining from the data recipients contractual commitments to limit use of and protect your personal information.
Tripping.com has a security program intended to keep the personal information stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access and misuse. Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling technologies and firewalls constructed to industry standards. We also use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that protects the data you send over the Internet. Personal information may only be accessed by persons within our organizations, or our third party suppliers, who require such access to carry out the uses indicated in this Privacy Policy.
