What information do we collect from users and how is it used?
This section describes the types of personal information we may collect about you, and how we use that information. We use the personal information we collect to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us; to improve our services; to provide you with information about other goods and services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased or enquired about; or to notify you about changes to our Services.
Information you provide to us directly. We may collect personal information, such as your name, phone number, address, industry, company and e-mail address when you when you register for our Services, sign up for our mailing list, or otherwise communicate with us.
Payment and transaction information. Information such as camera purchased and subscription plans, date and time of your transaction, and payment information, such as your credit card or bank account details. We use this information to facilitate transactions, detect and prevent fraud and inform our advertising and marketing.
Online Inquiries. When you submit an inquiry via the Services, we may ask for your first and last name, physical address, email address, phone number, company name, industry type, and certain other information from time to time. We request this information for identification purposes, and to communicate with you regarding your inquiry. If you provide your phone number, we may use that information to make direct dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, and to send text messages, from Matterport relating to our product and services.
Correspondence. If you correspond with us via email, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit.
Images stored. When you capture imagery and submit it to the Matterport Cloud (as described in the Matterport Cloud Subscription Agreement), we may collect personal information which is depicted within the imagery you submit. We do use this information in aggregated form for analytics and machine learning, but the results of these activities do not contain or disclose any personal information that is identifiable to you. We do not use this incidental information for any other purpose, but this information may be publicly displayed if you choose to display the underlying imagery publicly through the Matterport Cloud. If you do not wish to publicly display personal information depicted in the imagery you submit, you should either refrain from capturing such personal information in your imagery or designate the imagery as “private” in your Matterport Cloud account. For additional information on designating your imagery as “public” or “private”, restricting third parties from editing or re-sharing your imagery, and the consequences of archiving your imagery, deleting your imagery and/or terminating your account, please also see the Matterport Cloud Subscription Agreement. We will store your imagery for the longer of (i) the period of your subscription to the Matterport Cloud or (ii) 10 years from the date of first import into the Matterport Cloud.
URL, IP addresses, Device Information and Frequency of Use. Like many other online service providers, we collect and analyze information about our users’ utilization and navigation of our Services. This information helps us to design our Services to better suit our users’ needs, and we also use this information to share aggregated, anonymous information on the effectiveness of our Services with content owners and creators.
We track and collect data about how frequently you use the Services, the time You spend actively using the Services, and the pattern of actions you take in using the Services, We also track the URL that you visited before you came to our Services, the URL to which you next go, information about the browser through which you are accessing the Services, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We use this information to help diagnose problems with our Services and to administer our Services. Your IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad location and demographic information.
Our mobile applications also track and provide to us data about the ID and make/model of the mobile device that runs the app. The mobile applications will track information when you are online, and may also track information when you are offline.
Legal basis for processing in the EU
If you are a resident in the EU, we need to tell you the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information. In the EU, the purposes for which we process your personal data are:
Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you for the Service;
Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; and
Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation in the EU.
We may ask for your consent for processing your personal information in relation to the Services, in certain cases. You should be aware that you are entitled under Data Protection Legislation to withdraw your consent where that has been given, at any time.  If you do this and we have no alternative lawful reason to process your personal data, this may affect our ability to provide you with rights to use the Services.
In summary, we need certain categories of personal data in order to provide you with the Services. Certain other personal data is processed for our legitimate interests in cases where this does not result in prejudice to you. Certain other personal data is processed based on consent.
We have set out in the table at Annex 1 a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal basis we are relying on to process your personal data where more than one legal basis has been set out.

We disclose information that we collect about you to our third-party contractors who perform services for Matterport in connection with the Services and/or our business, or to complete or confirm a transaction that you conduct with us. Unless you request otherwise, we require these contractors to use or disclose this information only as necessary to perform services on our behalf in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by law.
We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you for marketing or promotional purposes, as further described below.

We reserve the right to release information that we collect to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary or appropriate.
Where do we process your personal information?
International Transfers of your personal information. As we are primarily located in the USA, any information you provide will initially be collected processed and stored in the USA. If you are in the EU or EEA, this may mean that your personal information will be stored in a jurisdiction that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal information than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in.
Privacy Shield. We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. privacy framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information received from European Union countries and Switzerland (the "Privacy Shield"). We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Principles of notice, choice and accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability ("Principles"). If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Principles shall govern.

How do we use online analytics services and tailored online marketing?
In our Services, we use Google Analytics and other third-party web analytics services. These third-party services use the sort of technology described in the preceding sections to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the URL that users visited before they came to our Services. These service providers will receive or directly collect the information collected by the technology, which they will use to evaluate your use of the Services. As described in the following paragraphs, we also use Google Analytics on this website, and in the services available through this website (collectively, the “Site”) for certain purposes related to online marketing. You may click here to install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on to prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics on the Site.
We also allow other third parties, such as Google Analytics and other ad networks and ad servers, to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site. These tracking technologies enable these third parties to serve our tailored marketing to you while viewing other areas of the Internet, based on anonymous information collected while you are visiting our Site. We have implemented the following Google Analytics advertising features based on interests and location for the purposes of remarketing: retargeting and enhanced demographic tracking, including affinity audiences, custom affinity audiences, in-market audiences, similar audiences, demographic and location targeting, and demographics and interest reports. The parties that provide these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of targeted marketing as described below. Click here for more information on how Google uses data when you use the Site.
You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out Link and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt-out of receiving tailored marketing from companies that participate in those programs, and if you are interested in learning about tailored browser marketing and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored marketing (i.e., not just for our Site). You may also visit the Google Ads Settings page to opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads. Please also see additional information here about Google Ad Settings for mobile apps. Be aware that you may still receive marketing content that is not tailored to your interests, even if you opt-out of tailored marketing, to the extent marketing technology is integrated into our Site. In addition, we are not responsible for any choices you make using any of the above opt-out links, and we do not control these opt-out methods or their continued availability or accuracy.
You may also receive tailored in-application marketing content when using an application on a mobile device. Each mobile operating system provides its own instructions on how to prevent or opt-out of the delivery of tailored in-application marketing content.
California privacy disclosures.
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn’t an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don’t respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions. In general, subject to certain exceptions, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide, free of charge, a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by sending an e-mail to info@matterport.com.
