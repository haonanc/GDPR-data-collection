Understanding Cookies
Websites can automatically place small text files, known as “cookies,” on the computers of their visitors.  So long as they do not expire or get deleted, cookies identify the unique browser used by the visitor.  On each subsequent visit to the website, the visitor’s browser will retrieve the cookie, allowing us to aggregate the number of return visitors. Northwell Health uses “cookies” to test and optimize our website design and content. We use two types of cookies on our websites:
We use session cookies to gather data for technical purposes, such as improving navigation through our website and generating statistics about how the website is used. Session cookies are temporary text files that expire when you leave our website. When cookies expire, they are automatically deleted from your computer. We do not use session cookies to collect personal information, and we do not share data collected from session cookies.
We use multi-session cookies, or persistent cookies, to customize our website for frequent visitors and to test variations of website design and content. Multi-session cookies are cookies that are stored over more than a single session on your computer. We do not use multi-session cookies to collect personal information, and we do not share data collected from multi-session cookies. Our multi-session cookies are set to expire no more than two years after your last visit to our website. After two years, they are automatically deleted from your computer. Northwell Health is unable to identify an individual by using such technologies.
Blocking session cookies from your computer will not affect your access to the content and tools on our website. Blocking multi-session or persistent cookies may affect the personalization of the information on those sites.
Website Security
We employ commercially reasonable measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the information we collect. These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. We use software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or other types of malicious use. Information collected from these sources may be used to help identify an individual in the event of a criminal investigation or as required by any legal process.
