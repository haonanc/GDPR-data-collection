How We Use the Information
We may use the information you provide about yourself or others to fulfill requests for our publications, products or services, to respond to inquiries about offerings and to offer other products, programs or services that may be of interest. We may combine information we receive with outside records and share such information with third parties to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that may be of interest to you. We may disclose personally identifiable information we receive from you and from third party sources to third parties whose practices are not covered by this privacy statement (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases and nonprofit organizations) that want to market products or services to you.
When you request a magazine, service or other product, we will forward the information you give us to the publisher or provider for fulfillment. They may contact you with special offers of possible interest.
We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or sweepstakes, or when we make changes to subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter or to contact you about your account.
If you choose to submit content (e.g., photos, videos, stories, online reviews, or communications to our editorial staff), we may publish your name, screen name and other information you have provided to us on our website, social media accounts or the websites and social media accounts of affiliated B.A.S.S., LLC sites.
The information we collect in connection with our social media accounts, online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs or services.
We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our publications and websites, and to enable us to customize your Internet experience. We also may use this information to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs or services.
We will disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law; for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency’s request.
Agents and contractors of B.A.S.S., LLC that have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for B.A.S.S., LLC. We may transfer your personally identifiable information to other B.A.S.S., LLC offices for internal management and administrative purposes. Your personal data will be transferred to other B.A.S.S., LLC offices where necessary for the performance or conclusion of our contractual obligations to you or for your benefit. To the extent allowed by applicable law, transfers of personally identifiable information may also be made where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Please note that if B.A.S.S., LLC or any of its subsidiaries or lines of business is sold or otherwise disposed of, including through merger of, consolidation or sale of assets, the relevant customer database, including personally identifiable information we may possess about you, may, in whole or in part, be sold, disposed of, transferred or otherwise disclosed as part of that transaction. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.

Cookies
To enhance your online experience, we use cookies. Cookies are small text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences.
