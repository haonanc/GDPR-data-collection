3. Notice for EU Residents:
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, Animoto Inc. is generally the “data controller” as such term is used in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) with respect to the information that can be associated with or relates to a person or could be used to identify a person (‘Personal Data’) collected through our Site; contact information is located at the end of this privacy policy. In some situations where we receive your Personal Data from another of our customers, we may be the “data processor” and such customer may be the “data controller” for purposes of the GDPR. In such cases, we may need to refer your inquiries, complaints, or requests to such customer as the data controller. In all cases where we are the data controller, the following provisions apply:
Rights of EU Residents
Consent
Animoto will obtain your consent before collecting and processing your Personal Data.
Right to Access, Update, and Delete Your Personal Data
You may request confirmation from us as to whether or not your Personal Data is being processed, where and for what purpose. We will provide you a copy of the Personal Data, free of charge, in an electronic format. We may ask for proof of identification to verify your access requests.  If your Personal Data that we hold is inaccurate or incomplete, please notify us and we will update the relevant information without undue delay. You may also request deletion of your Personal Data in our possession. In certain circumstances we may need to retain your Personal Data, such as: (i) where required by law; (ii) where necessary to continue providing services; or (iii) where the burden or expense of deleting such Personal Data would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. For example, in cases where we are not the data controller (such as when the personal data was collected on behalf of a third party data controller), we may need to refer you or your request to the applicable data controller.
Right to be Forgotten
If you no longer wish to use our Services, you may request an erasure of your Personal Data. We will erase your Personal Data and notify you when the erasure is completed. However, we will compare your right to be erased with the public interest in the availability of the data when considering your requests of erasure.
Right to Object or Opt-Out
You may object to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. If you choose to object, we will no longer process your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, unless there is a compelling legitimate grounds for future processing. You may not be able to use the full functionality of the Services as a result of an objection.
Right to Restrict Processing of Your Information
You may choose to restrict us from processing your Personal Data when: (1) you contest the accuracy of your Personal Data, (2) you oppose the erasure of your Personal Data when the processing is unlawful, (3) we no longer need the Personal Data to provide our Services but you would like to keep your Personal Data available for establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or (4) you object to processing of the Personal Data. If you choose to restrict processing of your Personal Data, we will only store and will not further process your Personal Data without your consent. However, we may process your Personal Data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or of a EU Member State. If it is necessary for us to process your Personal Data after you choose to restrict, we will inform you before any data processing starts.
Right to be Notified of Data Breach
You will receive data breach notification in accordance to applicable laws if we or our data processors become aware of a data breach which is likely to result in a risk for your rights and freedoms.
Right to Data Portability
You may require us to provide you a copy of your Personal Data, which you have previously provided, in electronic format. You are free to transmit the Personal Data to any other controllers.
Right to Lodge a Complaint
European residents who believe their rights have been violated under the GDPR may lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office or other supervisory authority.
Privacy by Design and Default
We are committed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal privacy at all design stages. Our design features address the amount of Personal Data collected, the extent of Personal Data processing, the period of Personal Data storage and Personal Data accessibility.
Animoto Processors
To support delivery of our Services, Animoto may engage and use data processors with access to certain Personal Data of its Users (each, a “Processor”). Animoto currently uses third-party Processors to (a) provide infrastructure services, (b) facilitate payments, (c) provide information for site security, maintenance, performance, and error tracking; (d) tracking and reporting user analytics for purposes of improving customer experience.

Legal: In certain situations, Animoto may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. If Animoto is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer your personal data (where relevant) to the successor of the relevant business, and they will be bound to the same obligations that we were previously bound to.

We may also disclose your personal information to any other third party with your prior consent.
7. Security of Information
We will keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure consistent with current industry standards. Security of your Personally Identifiable Information is of utmost concern to us. Personally Identifiable Information, once transmitted to us, will be stored on computers that only selected personnel and contractors have access to via password, and/or on web hosting servers maintained by Amazon Web Services, which employs its own physical and network security measures. In addition, your Animoto videos and/or content may be stored on Amazon Web Services servers. A copy of Amazon Web Services' Privacy Policy may be obtained here .
Your Animoto videos and user content are limited-access, where access is gained through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess the URL address of your video or content without an invitation from you including the relevant URL. However, because the videos and content are not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover your videos and/or content. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at sending us an email .
8. Changes to this Statement
Animoto has the discretion to update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
