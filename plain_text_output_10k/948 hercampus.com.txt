Privacy Policy
Purpose of this Privacy Policy
This privacy policy describes how Her Campus Media treats the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit the web sites, mobile-optimized versions of the web site, and digital applications and platforms to which this policy is linked.
What is Personally Identifiable Information
"Personally identifiable information" is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, telephone number and any other information that is connected with you personally.
Information This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply To
This privacy policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except Her Campus Media and only applies to the web sites, mobile-optimized versions of the web sites and digital applications and platforms to which this policy is linked. Any information you provide when you visit web sites other than those covered by this policy (including other web sites affiliated with Her Campus Media) or when you purchase any products or services, or enter contests, that may be linked to or advertised on our web site by companies other than Her Campus Media is subject to the privacy policies posted on those sites.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
Her Campus Media generally collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you enter a sweepstakes or contest, complete a survey, register for those portions of our sites that may require registration, make a purchase, participate in our social networking features, subscribe to our newsletters, and other electronic services you will be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, and shipping address. Information such as your age, gender, hobbies or interests may also be requested. This information may sometimes be collected by third party service providers with whom Her Campus Media contracts to host the web site or to fulfill requests for services; in that event, Her Campus Media asks such service providers to make the personal information available only to Her Campus Media for Her Campus Media to use in accordance with the terms of this policy and not to use the information for any other purpose. Her Campus Media uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. Â We might also send out e-mails to users and sweepstakes/contest entrants to announce special offers, services and announcements from our sites and/or our advertisers.
We may use information you provide us through emails, Q & A, blogs, comments, surveys, in response to polls, or though any other user-generated submission for editorial purposes, and may use your name and any stories you provide us in articles published online or on other platforms. Please be advised that any such submissions become the property of Her Campus Media and may be used by Her Campus Media for any lawful purpose. If you provide us with personal anecdotes, they may be attributed to you. Her Campus Media can edit, rewrite, use, and reuse the content, including your name, likeness, photograph, and biographical information you provide, in any way and any media whether now known or invented in the future, with or without attribution, including but not limited to publication on the website, and in trade media, and advertising. You agree that any content you send us will not violate any rights of any third party and that you will only send us content for which you own the rights.
Some of our sites may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis. Those transactions may take place on a Her Campus Media site, or the site of the third party. In either case, personal information you provide in connection with the transaction may be shared with the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such opportunities and features. Some of our sites may offer you the ability to access a third-party site with whom we have a relationship to access both sites through a co-branded registration or password; in that event, your applicable registration information may be shared with the third-party partner and used by them in accordance with their own privacy policy. We will notify you at the applicable point of sign up if any such co-branded registration or password practices will be in effect.
Some of our applications and mobile-optimized sites may have location-based features. For those features, we will collect your geographic location and, depending on the application, other information you provide us to enable you to enjoy the service being offered. For example, we may offer shopping features that allows you to get information about local merchants or travel features that allows you to locate nearby sights and destinations. We will use your location to serve relevant content, and your information may be shared with third party retailers and other facilities as applicable to allow you to take advantage of the particular service being offered.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.
In addition to the foregoing, Her Campus Media may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when:
we utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them;
You have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information may be shared with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing (Some of our contests and sweeps will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like your personal information to be shared with the sponsor. Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest);
the entity to whom the information is disclosed is one under control of, or under common control with Her Campus Media (for these purposes, a company controlling 20% or more of the voting stock of another entity shall be deemed to control such entity);
the entity to whom the information is disclosed is hosting web sites associated with our websites, other than those web sites covered by this policy;
the entity to whom the information is disclosed has affiliated with us to publish a website or furnish services associated with a website;
you have furnished us personal information with the intent that it be forwarded to a third party for use in connection with a specified service you are electing to participate in (examples include, without limitation, e-commerce partners, services to help old friends locate you online, etc.);
we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us);
we must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process;
we have reason to believe that someone may be causing injury to someone or interfering with our rights or the rights of our users, or general public, or using our services in violation of a legal or personal right; or
in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the web sites to which this policy applies.
