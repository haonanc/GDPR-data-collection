Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. Animaker wants to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use Animaker's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate Animaker's firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Animaker collects information from all end users of Animaker's services (the "Services") - those who access some of Animaker Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay subscription fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members") - what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. Animaker requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.
Introduction
You may visit the Animaker website without a need to disclose any personal information or any information. Animaker collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access various parts of Animaker's Services and the network of Web sites accessible through Animaker's Service. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use Animaker's Services and, generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below. Animaker always strive to provide the best user experience of high quality and to allow Animaker to provide the same, Animaker collects aggregate information about the use of the Services, including information about users accessing the site or viewing animations or using our Services on other sites.
Registration
Members are asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for Animaker Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. However, in instances where Animaker and a partner jointly promote the Services, Animaker may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of allowing Animaker and the partner to assess the results of the promotion.  In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. Animaker may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Members provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names of Members). As explained in more detail below, Animaker may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.
Online Advertisements

Animaker share aggregated and non-identifying information about Animaker Visitors and Members collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, Animaker use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements. Animaker does not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these advertisers.

Responses To Email Inquiries
When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to Animaker, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry that Animaker receives. Animaker does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.
Voluntary Customer Surveys
Animaker may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. Animaker encourage its customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in Animaker customer surveys is voluntary.
We take the information we receive from individuals responding to Animaker Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other Animaker customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions. Animaker then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of Animaker services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.
