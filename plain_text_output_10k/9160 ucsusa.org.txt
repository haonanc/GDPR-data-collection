Website Usage
Most areas of our site are accessible without having to provide personal information of any kind. Some of our services do, however, require some form of identification, which the user is free to provide (or withhold) voluntarily.
UCS uses Google Analytics to collect aggregate website browsing information including (but not limited to) IP address, domain name, page views, and Internet browser.

Cookies
Like most websites, UCS places a "cookie," or small text file, in the browser files of visitors to our site. This cookie is used to collect website traffic information.

Data collected is used in accordance with our privacy policy. Users retain the right to reject cookies and can opt out from interest-based advertising through their cookie settings or by using a browser plugin.
Collection of Personal Information
UCS may collect personal information when it is voluntarily submitted through our websites.
