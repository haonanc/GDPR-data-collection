Commitment to Privacy
Protecting your privacy is important to the owners and operators ("Website Owners" or "we") of the HBO Canada website (the "Website"). As part of our commitment to privacy protection, we have implemented this Privacy Policy, which explains our privacy practices, including those of the Website. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to better serve your needs. Notice of any changes will be provided on the Website and a copy of all amendments is on file at our offices. You can be sure that our Privacy Policy satisfies all of the requirements of applicable privacy law, including Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act ("PIPED Act").
This Privacy Policy governs the way we manage your Personal Information. If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, please contact us, using the contact information at the end of this policy.
Whenever you provide us with Personal Information, whether in writing, over the telephone, or online, you will be referred to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Policy, please contact us at the address given at the end of this Policy, we would be pleased to address your concerns.
What is "Personal Information"?
"Personal Information" is information about you as an individual. Examples include your name, mailing and e-mail addresses, age, birthday, telephone number, picture, and voice recording. Your personal preferences, such as your favourite colour or flavour of ice cream, could also qualify as Personal Information if connected with other information that identifies you. This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Information that we collect, how we collect it, why we collect it, and what we use it for.
"Non-identifiable Information" is information that cannot be associated with or traced back to a specific person. Non-identifiable information includes: anonymous aggregated information, information about your visits to the Website which is not linked to you, information about your computer's operating system and web browser software. Your computer and its operating systems, browsers, and memory contain vast quantities of transaction data and records of your use of it. This Personal Information could be gleaned from these systems by outsiders if you do not take steps to protect your system. It is our policy not to associate this information with customers, even though we verify some kinds of technical information to ensure that the Website is optimized to serve our customers.
When you interact with the Website, we may use a browser feature, known as a "cookie", to verify non-identifiable information about visitors to the Website and measure visitor traffic patterns. We do this to maintain the best possible Website. A cookie is a small computer file. When you first visit our Websites, the Website manager may have implemented a program that creates a small computer file stored on your computer's hard drive. We ensure that the minimum information required is placed in the cookie only so that we can recognize returning Website visitors. The cookie does not contain Personal Information and we will not combine information in the cookie with Personal Information that would enable us to identify you individually. On subsequent visits to the Website, our server communicates with your computer, reads the cookie, recognizes and confirms that you are a returning visitor. Our server uses this information to provide you with a "short cut" that facilitates the quickest, most efficient and best possible Website experience.
Most browser softwares allow you to delete cookies. You should consult your Internet service provider for information on how to delete cookies. This may interfere with our ability to personalize your experience at our Websites and be recognized, or may slow down performance.
