Effective Date: May 25, 2018
Your privacy is very important to us.  This Privacy Policy explains our information privacy practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  When you access and use our website and the Litmus services, features and information available on our website (collectively, the “Services”), you are consenting to the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
1. Key Privacy Points:
Email Submissions. Email submissions (“Email Submissions”) uploaded by a customer to our Services belong to that customer.  We don’t use a customer’s Email Submissions, including any resulting email previews generated via the Services (“Email Previews”), for purposes unrelated to that customer or the use of our Services, except in limited circumstances (e.g., we are compelled by subpoena, or the customer has given us permission to do so).  Email Submissions should never contain personal data.
Email Analytics. All data collected by Litmus on behalf of a customer that elects to use our email analytics Services (“Email Analytics”) belongs to that customer.  We don’t use Email Analytics data for purposes unrelated to that customer or the use of our Services, except in aggregated, de-identified form as permitted under our Terms of Service (or such other service agreement between Litmus and the customer) or other limited circumstances (e.g., we are compelled by subpoena, or the customer has given us permission to do so).
While we strongly prefer that our customers do not provide us with or collect any personal data in connection with their use of Email Analytics Services, if a customer does elect to provide or collect that information we don’t use it for any other purpose.  Litmus is merely a custodian of that data.
If you use Email Analytics Services, you agree to comply with applicable privacy laws, including requirements to inform the recipients of your emails about the specific uses and disclosures of their data described herein, and to directly address any concerns they may have about your privacy policies and/or use of their information for this purpose.
User Data. Personal data provided by customers to set up user accounts is used by Litmus only as authorized by the individual user (“User”) or as otherwise permitted by law.
Sharing. We only share your information in limited circumstances in accordance with applicable law.
Security and Storage. We hold customer data securely on servers located in the United States.  We leverage Amazon’s AWS infrastructure and built-in security controls, which incorporate several modern security standards and best practices.  Please see our Trust Center for more information on our security practices.

This Privacy Policy applies to information gathered by Litmus Software, Inc., including our wholly-owned subsidiary, Litmus Software Ltd. (collectively, “Litmus,” “we,” “us” or “our”), through your use of our Services.
This policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that we do not own or control, including third-party websites, services and applications (“Third-Party Services”) that you may access through our Services, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.  While we attempt to partner with only Third-Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we are not responsible for the content or privacy policies of those third parties.  You are responsible to review the privacy policies of any Third-Party Services you access.
3. What Information Does Litmus Collect?
We gather various types of information from our Users, as explained more fully below.  We may use that information to facilitate the setup of User accounts and profiles, contact Users, fulfill requests for Services, personalize and improve our Services, analyze how Users engage with our Services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.  We may share certain types of personal data with third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.  We may also use cookies and similar tools, including third-party analytics providers and technologies, in collecting this information.

Account Registration Information. You need a Litmus User account before you can use our Services.  When you set up a User account, we collect personal data, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, browser information, and username.   You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or take advantage of some features of our Services.
Billing Information. If you sign up for our Services and/or to attend a paid event, we require you to provide billing details, such as a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your applicable method of payment (e.g., payment card information).  If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the customer.
Account Settings. You can set various preferences and personal details on your account preferences page, such as your username and communication preferences (e.g.  opting in or out of receiving marketing emails from Litmus).
Event Registration Information. If you elect to attend an event hosted by Litmus (e.g., Litmus Live or a webinar), we may collect personal data, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and other information.  You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or take advantage of some features (e.g., receipt of emails regarding event details, electronic copies of event materials, etc.).
Survey Data. If you elect to participate in a Litmus survey, we may collect, store and process your survey responses.
Other Data. We may collect your personal information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts (e.g., sales inquiries, customer support requests, etc.).
Information Collected Indirectly or Passively when You Interact with Us.
Usage Data. We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our Services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions and other related information. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses, internet service providers, the files viewed on our website (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions and timestamps.
Device Data. We collect data from the devices and applications you use to access our Services, such as IP address, operating system version, device type, system and performance information and browser type.  We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.
Information from Cookies. We employ cookies and similar tools, including through the use of third party analytics and tracking services, to collect data about individuals who access and use our website.  This data includes usage and user statistics.  For example, this data tells us how often individuals use parts of our websites, so that we can make our websites appealing and easy to use, and our content as relevant as possible.
Information from Third Parties. We may collect your personal data from third parties if you give permissions to those third parties to share your information with us or where you have made that information publicly available
Data Collected Through Use of Email Analytics Services
We offer Email Analytics Services that, if available through a customer’s subscription, may allow us to collect data on the customer’s behalf about the emails that the customer sends. We provide a pixel that the customer may include in the body of the emails the customer sends that enables us to collect certain data on the customer’s behalf about its email recipients.  Email Analytics Services are intended to allow the email sender to measure the performance of the email message and to learn how to improve email delivery and open rates.  Such data may include, as determined by our customer via its configuration of the Services, the email recipients’ IP addresses, email addresses, the browser and email clients used, geolocation information inferred from IP addresses and details about how their recipients engage with the email (e.g., whether or not the email was read,       forwarded or printed). Click here for more information about the data elements processed in connection with Email Analytics Services.
It is in our customers’ discretion as to what data is collected in connection with Email Analytics Services and, therefore, each customer is solely responsible for the collection and use of any such data, including, without limitation, ensuring that such collection and use is in accordance with the customer’s privacy policies and all applicable laws.
4. How Does Litmus Use the Information We Collect?

You can’t opt out of receiving these communications since they are required to provide our Services to you.
Marketing Purposes. We will only send marketing-related communications if you have consented to receive such communications.

5. Will Litmus Share Any of the Information we Receive?
We may share your personal data with third parties as follows:
Service Providers. We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide Services to you (e.g., payment processors, hosting services, email service providers and web traffic analytics tools).  Unless we tell you differently, our service providers do not have any right to use the personal data we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.  We also implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us and handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
With Your Organization; Billing Contacts. If the email address under which you have registered your User account belongs to or is controlled by an organization (e.g., your employer), we may disclose that email address and other pertinent account information to that organization in order to help it understand who associated with that organization uses Litmus, and to assist the organization with its enterprise accounts.  In addition, if your User account details are different from the billing contact listed for your account, we may disclose your identity and the account details to the billing contact upon their request.
User Profiles and Submissions. Certain User profile information, including without limitation a User’s name and location, and any email, video, image or other content that such User has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other Users to facilitate User interaction within the Services (e.g., to provide examples on our blog or to encourage interaction through a forum hosted on our website) or to address your request for Services and support.  Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other Users who can see the personal data in your User profile and/or what information in your User profile is visible to others.  Any information you upload to your public User profile, along with any personal data or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other individuals can view (e.g., on discussion boards, in forums, messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others.  Your username may also be displayed to other Users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through public portions of our websites and other individuals can contact you through messages and comments.
Affiliated Businesses and Third-Party Services We Do Not Control. In certain situations, businesses or Third-Party Services we are affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the our Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your personal data with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.  We have no control over the policies and practices of Third-Party Services as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated Third-Party Service, please review all such policies that may apply.
Business Transfers. We may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred.  Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal data would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
Protection of Litmus and Others. We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Litmus, our employees, our Users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Usage Information. We may collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites through cookies or otherwise.  We may use this information and/or data in aggregate form (as combined with information and/or data that we receive from our other Users and service providers) for our marketing or other business-related purposes. For example, usage information tells us how often visitors and Users use parts of our websites and, therefore, can be used to help us make our websites appealing as possible and our content relevant.
