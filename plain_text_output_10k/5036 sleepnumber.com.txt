Is Information from Children Collected?
The Website is not intended to attract children under the age of 13. You will need to affirm that You are             more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legally sufficient parental or legal guardian             consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations,             representations, and warranties set forth in this Privacy Notice, and to abide by and comply with this             Privacy Notice. In any case, You affirm that You are over the age 13, as THE WEBSITE IS NOT INTENDED FOR             CHILDREN UNDER 13 WHO ARE UNACCOMPANIED BY THEIR PARENT(S) OR LEGAL GUARDIAN(S).
With respect to the Services, We may collect, store, and use Information about a Child in connection with             administering and operating Our Services. Such collection occurs when You create a User Profile on behalf of             Your Child in connection with the SleepIQ Kids bed or the extent you allow your child to use a Bed you             purchased. We only collect personally identifiable information reasonably necessary to provide services             requested by the Child’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s), and only after We receive parental/legal guardian             consent for such collection. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE ACT OF YOU CREATING A USER PROFILE FOR A             CHILD OR OTHERWISE ALLOWING YOUR CHILD TO USE A BED IS YOUR PARENTAL/LEGAL GUARDIAN CONSENT FOR THE             COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AND USAGE INFORMATION ABOUT AND FROM THAT CHILD, AS PERMITTED IN             THIS PRIVACY NOTICE.
For the avoidance of doubt, We will not intentionally collect Personal Information about children unless             You create a User Profile for Your Child. We will not share personally identifiable information that We             collect about a Child with third parties, except for information that We share to provide the services             requested by the Child’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and except as provided in the “Is Personal             Information shared?” section of this Privacy Notice. We do not knowingly advertise or market to children. We             will maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Information We collect about a Child,             including by taking reasonable steps to release such Information only to parties capable of maintaining its             confidentiality and security.
If You desire to prevent further collection of Your Child’s Personal Information, You should deactivate             their User Profile. If that happens, then We will no longer be able to provide Services on behalf of Your             Child. If You deactivate Your Child’s User Profile, You must uninstall the App from the device(s) used by             Your Child. If You change Your mind We may not be able to reactivate the Child’s User Profile.
Parents and legal guardians should be aware that while this Privacy Notice will govern Our use of Personal             Information, use of information that is voluntarily given by a Child – or others – in email exchanges,             bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited communications. We             encourage all parents and legal guardians to instruct their children in the safe and responsible use of             their Personal Information while using the Internet and mobile applications.
How are My California Specific Rights Protected?
Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide certain personally identifiable             information in connection with obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are             entitled to request and obtain from Us (once a calendar year) information about the customer information We             shared (if any) with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information             would include the categories of customer information and the names and addresses of those businesses with             which We shared Your customer information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in             2017 will receive information regarding 2016 sharing activities, if any).
To obtain this information, please send an email message to Legal@sleepnumber.com with “Request for             California Privacy Information” in the subject line and in the body of Your message.

How are “Do Not Track” Signals Handled?
Note that Your browser settings may allow You to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites             and online services You visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track”             means in this context. Like many websites and online services, We currently do not alter Our practices when             We receive a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser.

In some cases, the Data is generated             by averaging, correlating, or otherwise manipulating raw data being captured and transmitted to Your Bed. We             intend the Data to be informational only and You should not use the Data as a substitute for medical care or             diagnosis, including, without limitation, the proper supervision of either a medical condition or person.             For example, nobody should use the Services to monitor a person of limited mobility or who is at risk of a             fall to ensure that they remain in bed, or to monitor someone with sleep apnea to ensure they are breathing.             We undertake no responsibility or liability with respect to use of the Data to ensure Your or any other             person’s health or safety. You acknowledge and agree that the Services and the Bed do not protect Your or             any other person’s health or safety. If You rely on information provided by the Services or the Bed, You do             so solely at Your own risk.

You are ultimately             responsible for protecting Your username, password, Sleep Number account, and User Profile information from             disclosure to third parties, and You are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption             technologies.
