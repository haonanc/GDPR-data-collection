Website Policy ( As Approved by the Council of Elders on February 23, 2007 )
1. No website other than the official website of the United Church of God, an International Association (hereinafter the “Church” or “UCG IA “) at http://www.ucg.org and the official websites of United Church of God National Councils outside the United States which have been sanctioned by the Church, may use the name “United Church of God” or contain, republish, refer to, advertise or take orders for Church literature or other copyrighted materials, in whole or in part, that are proprietary to the Church without UCG IA’s written permission. Local websites receiving such permission should create a hyperlink to Church literature located at http://www.ucg.org/booklets for the United States (and/or the address of the Web site of their National Council if outside the U.S.) for viewing, downloading or for taking website visitor requests for said literature. Each website that creates an appearance of affiliation with the Church shall be subject to review to help ensure that its content does not violate the law or personal rights.
2. Local congregations or others claiming a Church affiliation who are using the name of the Church must not violate the Church’s copyright(s), trademark(s) or service mark(s), or other intellectual property.
3. The only official website of the UCG IA is located at http://www.ucg.org . Any other website maintained by a local congregation of UCG IA , or third parties claiming affiliation with UCG IA , or using its name in a way that is likely to convey such an affiliation, must display on the index or introductory page the following statement. In effect that statement shall say that they are not official websites of UCG IA and that the UCG IA does not endorse and is not responsible for the claims and representations made by that website:
“This is not the official website of the United Church of God, an International Association (“UCG IA “). The only official UCG IA website is at www.ucg.org , or one of the websites of National Councils which are part of UCG IA . They are not responsible and will not be held liable for the content, representations, or any claims arising out of the materials contained on this website.”
4. The Church’s Council of Elders may prescribe rules and ethical guidelines within which National Council, local church, and third party (claiming a UCG IA affiliation) websites shall be required to conform. Failure to conform to these rules and guidelines can result in withdrawal of UCG IA permission to use the name “United Church of God” in connection with that National, local church or third party website.
5. The Church reserves the right to modify this policy at any time with or without advance notice.
