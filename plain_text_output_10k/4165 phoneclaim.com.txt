This policy is incorporated as part of the Terms of Service that apply to your use of the services. When you use our services, you acknowledge that you have accepted the Terms of Service and this policy without exception. You also acknowledge that you consent to our privacy practices, including our use and disclosure of your personal information.
If you do not consent to the Terms of Service or this policy, please do not use our services or provide any personal information.

This Policy does not cover and we are not responsible for third-party sites or applications that may be linked from our sites; linking to them does not imply an endorsement. We are not responsible for these sites or applications or any information they may collect. You should always review the privacy policy of any third-party site or application.
Personal information we collect
When you use our services, we may collect the below types of personal information:
Name;
Cell phone number;
Information that identifies your mobile device, such as Electronic Serial Number ("ESN") or International Mobile Equipment Identity ("IMEI") data;
Device serial number and media access control ("MAC") address;

Other information that personally identifies you or is linked or linkable to you.

Asurion and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the site, track users\' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Asurion also gathers certain information about the use of Asurion\'s services, including the number of unique visitors, the frequency of visits, how users interact with the sites, user experience preferences, IP address, and other information that may help Asurion improve the customer experience, mitigate fraudulent activity, and comply with legal requirements. Such information may include, but is not limited to the following:
Log information
When you visit Asurion\'s sites we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs. This type of information includes details of how you interacted with our services. It may include personal information such as: IP address, Unique Device Identifier, or CallerID / ANI (Automatic Number Identification) information, content of web pages, transaction with APIs (Application Program Interface), transactions with IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems, activity and content of visitor interaction with call center representatives; application usage activity, hardware information, hardware and system settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, referral URL, etc.
Cookies
A cookie is a small, data file that is managed by your web browser or other application and stored on your local system. Asurion uses session and persistent cookies to, among other things, identify your computer during a particular interaction and analyze your behavior during a particular visit. Most web browsers provide you with the ability to accept or decline cookies, as well as to be warned each time a cookie is being sent. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully use Asurion\'s services.
Pixel tags
Pixel tags, also known as web beacons, help Asurion better manage user experience and content tracking. Pixel tags are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which provide a similar function to cookies and are used to track user interaction with content provided by Asurion or an affiliate organization. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\'s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly within content. The small size and transparency of pixel tags are not intended to deceive content recipients, but minimize distraction.
Third-party data sources
Asurion may leverage external data sources in order to provide context and background on the users of its services in order to improve customer experience, mitigate fraud or malicious activity, or comply with internal company and external regulatory requirements.
Do Not Track and Third-Party Advertising Cookies
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative, http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection/, that has developed a technical "flag" or signal that an end-user may be able to activate within their browser software to notify sites that they do not wish to be "tracked" by third parties as defined by the initiative. The initiative, however, has not reached a consensus as to exactly what technical or other actions those parties receiving the signal should take. As a result, Do-Not-Track has not yet been standardized and most sites, including Asurion Sites, do not alter their behavior or change their services when they receive a "do-not-track" flag or signal. You can, however, make decisions about your privacy and the advertisements you receive.
Some of the ads you receive on sites are customized based on predictions about your interests generated from your visits to different Sites. This type of ad customization is sometimes called "online behavioral" or "interest-based" advertising. We partner with a third-party to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here or if you are located in the European Union click here . Please note you will continue to receive generic ads. As an alternative to the opt-out, you can also elect to block all cookies from first parties (such as Asurion) and from third parties (such as entities involved in advertising) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. Please note, however, that if you do decide to block cookies, some parts of Asurion\'s sites may not function correctly.
