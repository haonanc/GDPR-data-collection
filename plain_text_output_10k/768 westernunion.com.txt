Who we are
What we do
How does Western Union Financial Services, Inc. protect my personal information?
To help protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use, we endeavor to use reasonable security measures. These measures can include physical, electronic and procedural safeguards such as computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We also endeavor to limit access to personal information to only employees, agents and representatives that need to know. Despite our efforts, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your personal information, transmissions to us, or may wrongly instruct you to disclose information to them by posing as Western Union or by misinforming you about our services. Always use caution and good judgment when sending money and when using internet and mobile technologies.
How does Western Union Financial Services, Inc. collect my personal information?
We collect your personal information, for example, when you:
send or receive money, complete a payment or use or request other products or services from us or other financial companies
submit information to us, our Agents or other third parties on applications, forms, and by other means
use or visit our or other online sites (for example, to complete a transaction, manage your accounts, or provide your choices)
enter a promotion, register for email alerts or marketing communications, or join a loyalty program
use our mobile app or internet sites, such as westernunion.com
We also collect information about you from a variety of sources, including without limitation, computer systems and mobile devices; third party sources such as our business clients, government agencies, advertising agencies and networks, social media operators and networks, and other suppliers of information; and consumer reporting agencies. We may collect, track and combine information across devices, platforms and transaction channels.
Why can't I limit all sharing?
Federal law gives you the right to limit only 
sharing for affiliates’ everyday business purposes—information about your creditworthiness
affiliates from using your information to market to you
sharing for nonaffiliates to market to you
State laws and individual companies may give you additional rights to limit sharing. For details, see the “To limit our sharing” section.
What happens when I limit sharing for an account I hold jointly with someone else?
Your choices will apply to everyone on your account.
