You may interact with us directly, such as when you sign up for a Fivestars account through the Site or App, as well as indirectly, such as when you sign up for a Fivestars account through our Platform operated by one of our Rewards Providers or otherwise interact with one of our Rewards Providers.
Information You Provide
We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide it, such as when you register for access to the Services and create an account, use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our surveys. For example, we may collect your name, phone number, email address, photograph, birthdate, location information, Third-Party Service (defined below) login credentials, other information (such as your name and online activity) based on your registration and privacy settings on those Third-Party Services, and the messages you send or receive through the Services.

The collection of this data allows Rewards Providers to automatically award you rewards points.
By voluntarily providing us with information or making a purchase at a Rewards Provider that uses POS devices, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide information, you acknowledge and agree that such information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Fivestars and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.

We may also remove your personal information from POS device data and aggregate it with other anonymous data, pool and/or combine aggregated data with other information, and share aggregated data with Rewards Providers, its affiliates, service providers, agents and business partners. Fivestars may also disclose aggregated data to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

In addition, one of the special features of the Services is that they allow you to integrate various online third-party services, such as social media and social networking services (“Third-Party Services”), directly into your Fivestars experience. To take advantage of this feature, we will ask you to provide us your username and password for the relevant Third-Party Services.

INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
Fivestars is not in the business of selling your personal information. We consider personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Rewards Providers: To the extent you have obtained or redeemed a reward offered by a Rewards Provider, added a Rewards Provider as a membership to your account, made a purchase at or through a Rewards Provider, or otherwise participated in any other activity sponsored or offered on behalf of the Rewards Provider, we may provide your information to such Rewards Providers (a) for the Rewards Provider to redeem and validate your reward, send you customized offers, troubleshoot redemption, combat fraud and otherwise communicate with you; (b) as part of legal proceedings affecting Fivestars or the Rewards Provider; or (c) to send you marketing information or otherwise facilitate a direct relationship between the Rewards Provider and you.
Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.

Related Companies: We may also share your information with our Related Companies, but will only do so in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Fivestars, like many businesses, sometimes hires agents or service providers to perform certain business-related functions.

These third parties may match this data with information that they have previously collected about you under their own privacy policies.
Your Public Profile: If you make any information available through your public profile, it will be made available to members of the Fivestars community. Please note that your first name and last initial and photo are, by default, available on your public profile, while your phone number, email, and birthday are kept nonpublic (consistent with this Privacy Policy). Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these public areas of the Services.
Legal Requirements: Fivestars may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation or assist government enforcement agencies, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Fivestars, Rewards Providers, or our users, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, (iv) protect against legal liability; (v) protect Rewards Providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; or (vi) protect the security or integrity of the Services.
