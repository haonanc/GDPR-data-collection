Our Commitment to Privacy
Cub Cadet LLC, including each of its subsidiaries and/or affiliates, having a principal place of business located at 5903 Grafton Road, Valley City, Ohio 44280 (“Cub Cadet”) is committed to protecting the privacy and security of personal information. As part of normal business activities, we may collect and store personal information regarding customers, employees and associates, suppliers, and distributors. Personal information may be collected, transferred, and stored on servers located in any country in which we do business.
The following persons or entities may have access to the information that you provide to Cub Cadet: Cub Cadet, our employees and associates; Cub Cadet authorized sales and service centers; and service providers who assist us with archival, auditing, accounting, legal, business consulting, and website or technology services. Cub Cadet will not need your consent for the transmission of your personal information to the foregoing persons or entities. Please bear in mind that Cub Cadet and our service providers will take reasonable care to protect data and limit access only to associates who have a legitimate business reason to view the data. All parties who have access to your information are required to keep the information confidential and may not use it for any purpose other than to provide you services within the normal business activities of Cub Cadet and its authorized sales and service centers.
This policy (the “Policy”) applies to all personal information that is provided to Cub Cadet in any form or medium, and may be amended from time to time. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes here as notification and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back to our website periodically.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we know are under the age of 13. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent/guardian may follow the procedures below to access a child's information and to request the information be deleted from our records. Following such a request, we will make reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our records.

Why We Collect Personal Information
 
 
Cub Cadet limits the collection and use of personal information to what is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the personal information is collected. The personal information we collect will only be used for the purposes identified at the time of collection or as outlined in this Policy.
CHOICE
If at any time you do not wish to continue receiving information from us or you would like to withdraw the personal information you have previously disclosed, you can ask that your personal information be removed from our records and/or consent withdrawn. You can do so by submitting a request to:

Unless otherwise authorized by the individual, Cub Cadet will not disclose personal information to a third party for use in a manner incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected. However, an individual may not opt out of the transfer of his or her personal information which is transferred by Cub Cadet to a third party for the purpose of (1) meeting applicable legal requirements or (2) permitting the legitimate interests of Cub Cadet in making promotions, appointments, or other employment decisions. For certain more sensitive personal information (which may include race, gender, religion, medical information, etc.) Cub Cadet will provide an affirmative or explicit (opt in) choice if the personal information is to be disclosed to a third party for use in a manner incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected.

SECURITY
No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, despite our efforts to protect personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us online. You transmit all such information at your own risk.
However, once we receive your transmission, we take reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is safeguarded at all times. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of personal information under our control. Our data networks are secured and protected by firewalls and other safeguards. In addition to technological measures, we also ensure that personal information stored on our premises or stored by our third parties, is secured by other means, including restricting access and using locked and secured storage units.
In the event of a breach of our systems and unless a law enforcement agency informs us that notification would impede a criminal investigation, you will be notified of any unencrypted personal information that was or was reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person as soon as reasonably possible.
