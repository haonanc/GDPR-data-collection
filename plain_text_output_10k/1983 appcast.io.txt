What Information Do We Collect?
Information You Provide Us
When you register as a user of the Service and at other times, you submit basic information such as your company name, email address, phone number and physical address. We also collect and maintain your user ID and password, which you create and provide to use. In connection with using the Service, from time to time, you will provide us with job openings and job ads along with the cost-per-applicant you are willing to pay.
Information Collected Through Technology
To provide the Service, we collect certain information from job applicants using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. We use cookies and web beacons to collect information from job applicants when they click on an Appcast sponsored job ad at third party websites and when job applicants start and complete a job application at your website or a website operated by your applicant tracking system. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, referring URLs, and dates and times of site visits. A cookie is a text file that websites send to a user’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the device and browser or to store information or settings in a browser. A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag or pixel tag, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but browser settings can be changed to prevent these cookies from collecting information. Disabling cookies does not necessarily disable the use of pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies that collect information.

Name
Contact information (e.g., email address, physical address, telephone number)

You acknowledge and agree that we own all of the information we collect from job applicants, including information collected via cookies and web beacons regarding job ad views, job application starts and job application completions. We may use such information for any purpose whatsoever in connection with our business; provided, however, that we will not sell such information to data brokers or any other third parties. Further, in no event will we publicly disclose any performance-related data specific to you.

Data Storage and Security
Information security is important to us. The security of your information depends on your protection of your account user IDs and passwords. Please do not disclose your user IDs or passwords to unauthorized people. We use reasonable efforts to keep your information safe. Although we take reasonable precautions to protect your information, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.
