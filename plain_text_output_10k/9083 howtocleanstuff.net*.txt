How We Use Cookies

We use “analytics” cookies which, in conjunction with our web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the number of people visiting HowToCleanStuff.net and which parts of our website are most popular. This helps us gather and improve our website and better serve our users. We do not generally store any personal information that you provide to us in a cookie.

These cookies allow us to know whether or not you’ve seen an advertisement or a type of advertisement, and how long it is since you’ve seen it.
We may also use cookies set by a third party to more accurately target advertising specifically to you. These cookies are anonymous – they store information about the content you are browsing, but no personally-identifiable information.

The companies that create these cookies have their own privacy policies, and we have no access to read or write these cookies. These third party advertising cookies may be used by those third parties to anonymously target ads to you on other websites you visit, based on your visit to our website.
