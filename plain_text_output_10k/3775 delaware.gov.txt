When you visit the Delaware.gov Web Portal, some basic information may be collected from your web browser. This information is used solely to help us make this site more useful to visitors, to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the kinds of technology they use.

The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;

The web site you visited prior to coming to this web site;
The web site you visit as you leave this web site; and
If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.
What if I send you an email?
You may choose to provide us with personal information, as an e-mail with a comment or question. This information is used to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we share your e-mail with other State agencies and employees who may be better able to help you, and these staffs may be employed by a different agency within the State. By law, we cannot share this information with individuals (including state employees) that do not require it as a normal part of their official duties. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, or as required by law, we do not distribute, share, sell, or lease e-mail to any other entities without your consent.

Does the Delaware.gov Web Portal require me to accept cookies?
Visitors to the Delaware.gov Web Portal can access the Portal without accepting cookies, however, the Delaware Portal does use cookies to improve information to users.
What is a Cookie?
There are two general types of cookies that web sites make use of:
1. Session cookies — these are cookies created by a web site that exist only as long as your visit to that web site. They are not stored permanently on your computer.
2. Persistent cookies — these cookies are stored on your computer by a web site for some period of time and are used when you return to that site in the future.
A cookie provides a way for a web site to keep track of a user's internet browsing patterns and preferences. Cookies contain a range of web site addresses for which they are valid. When a user's web browser encounters those addresses again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user's specific preferences were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent times.
What won't a cookie do?
Certain web-based applications operated by Delaware State agencies (e.g., online tax filing with the Delaware Division of Revenue) may require users to establish a user ID and password. When accessing these applications through the Delaware.gov Portal you will need to separately enter and/or store your user information as required by the agency operating the application. A cookie that is stored on your computer for these applications will not incorporate those separate user IDs and passwords. In other words, should a third party use your computer they WILL NOT have access to personal information (e.g., your name or e-mail address) simply by virtue of having cookies stored on your computer. A third party using your computer MAY BE ABLE to view your personalized accounts when using your computer if you have selected the option that allows a web site or service to "remember" your username and password. If you are using a computer in a shared location, or are uncomfortable with this, you may want to avoid this option. If you do not want cookies stored on your computer, you should carefully read the information contained in the next section entitled "What options do I have with respect to cookies?"
What options do I have with respect to cookies?
You can have your browser disable cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser under the "Options" or "Preferences" menu.
Will my information be disclosed to third parties?
The Delaware.gov Portal will not distribute, share, sell, or lease your information to third parties for direct marketing or e-mail marketing purposes. The information collected at this site will remain confidential to the extent permitted by state or federal law. State law may, however, require disclosure upon request of certain information collected at this site should it be deemed "public information" under the Delaware Freedom of Information Act. To learn more about requirements for requests, and information that may be disclosed in response to a request, consult the Delaware Freedom of Information Act, Title 29, Chapter 100 of the Delaware Code.
