AND CO collects Your Personal Information:
AND CO is a provider of online back office service designed for freelancers     and small businesses, including online accounting and finance management     application and services, simple contract and document template services,     and professional referral services. The information we gather enables us to     personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection     with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or     display some of your Personal Information. “Personal Information” is     information about an identifiable individual, and may include information     such as the individual’s name, email address, telephone number, bank     account details, taxation details, and accounting and financial     information. AND CO may collect Personal Information directly from You when     You:
register to use the Services,
use the Services,
post to the AND CO Community forum or on our blog,
contact the AND CO support team, and/or
visit our Website or App.
You can always choose not to provide Your Personal Information to AND CO,     but it may mean that we are unable to provide You with the Services.
AND CO may receive Personal Information from You about others:
Through Your use of the Services, AND CO may also collect information from     You about someone else. If You provide AND CO with Personal Information     about someone else, You warrant and represent that You are authorized to     disclose that information to AND CO and that AND CO may collect, use and     disclose such information for the purposes described in this Privacy     Policy.
This means that You must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual     concerned is aware of and/or consents to the various matters detailed in     this Privacy Policy, including the fact that their Personal Information is     being collected, the purposes for which that information is being     collected, the intended recipients of that information, the individual's     right to obtain access to that information, AND CO’s identity, and how to     contact AND CO.
Where requested to do so by AND CO, You must also assist AND CO with any     requests by the individual to access or update the Personal Information You     have collected from them and entered into the Services.
AND CO collects, holds, and uses Your Personal Information for limited       purposes:
AND CO collects Your Personal Information so that we can provide You with     the Services. In doing so, AND CO may use the Personal Information we have     collected from You for purposes related to the Services, including but not     limited to:
verify Your identity,
administer the Services,
notify You of new or changed services offered in relation to the       Services,
carry out marketing or training relating to the Services,
assist with the resolution of technical support issues or other issues       relating to the Services,
comply with applicable rules, laws and regulations, and
communicate with You.
By using the Services, You consent to Your Personal Information being     collected, held and used in this way and for any other use You authorize.     AND CO will only use Your Personal Information for the purposes described     in this Policy or in accordance with Your express consent.
Note that we do not collect financial information, such as your bank     account or credit card number, credit card type and expiration date, and     other such information (“Financial Information”). When You register for     your Account or pay Your invoices, Your Financial Information is collected     and stored by our Payment Processor. Currently, AND CO’s Payment Processor     for payments for use of the Services is Stripe (https://stripe.com). If you     use Stripe, you agree to the Stripe terms of service (located at     https://stripe.com/payment-terms/legal) and privacy policy (located at     https://stripe.com/us/privacy).
AND CO may aggregate Your non-personally identifiable data:
By using the Services, You agree that AND CO may access, aggregate and use     non-personally identifiable data AND CO has collected from You     (“Non-Personal Information”). AND CO may share Non-Personal information     with its partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct     business (“Business Partners”). Non-Personal information includes     information that is (i) not Personal Information or (ii) derived from     Personal Information but has been anonymized so that it is no longer     personally identifiable. We use and share this type of data so that we and     our Business Partners can understand how and how often people use our and     their services or websites, which facilitates improving our Services, their     services and how our Services interface with their services. In addition,     these Business Partners may share with us non-private, aggregated or     otherwise Non-Personal Information about You that they have independently     developed or acquired.
AND CO may use Non-Personal Information to:
assist us to better understand how our customers are using the       Services,
provide our customers with further information regarding the uses and       benefits of the Services,
enhance freelancer’s productivity, including by creating useful       business insights from that aggregated data and allowing You to       benchmark Your business’ performance against that aggregated data, and
otherwise to improve the Services.
AND CO Servers:
All Data, including Personal and Non-Personal Information, that is entered     into the Services by You, or automatically imported on Your instruction, is     transferred to AND CO’s servers as a function of transmission across the     Internet. By using the Services, You consent to Your Personal Information     being transferred to our servers as set out in this Privacy Policy.
You should review our Privacy Policy regularly to keep informed of any     updates.
AND CO takes steps to protect your personal information:
AND CO is committed to protecting the security of Your Personal Information     and we take all reasonable, industry-standard precautions to protect it     from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. Your Personal     Information is stored on secure servers and all Data transferred between     You and the Services is encrypted. However, the Internet is not in itself a     secure environment and we cannot give an absolute assurance that Your     Personal Information will be secure at all times. Transmission of Personal     Information over the Internet is at Your own risk and You should only     input, or instruct the inputting of, Personal Information to the Services     within a secure environment. You are responsible for preventing     unauthorized access to Your account and Personal Information, including,     for example, by protecting Your account credentials and limiting access to     devices on which You access the Services.
We will advise You as soon as reasonably possible, and in accordance with     applicable laws, upon discovering or being advised of a security breach     where Your Personal Information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed,     copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorized persons or in any     unauthorized manner.
AND CO only discloses Your Personal Information in limited       circumstances:
AND CO will only disclose the Personal Information You have provided to us     to entities outside the AND CO group of companies if it is necessary and     appropriate to facilitate the purpose for which Your Personal Information     was collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including the provision of     the Services. AND CO will not otherwise disclose Your Personal Information     to a third party unless You have provided Your express consent. However,     notwithstanding the foregoing, AND CO does reserve the right to access,     read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is     necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or     governmental request; (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of     Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof; (iii)     detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;     (iv) respond to user support requests or (v) protect our rights, property     or safety, our users and the public. This includes exchanging information     with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and     spam/malware prevention. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify You     if we are required by law to disclose Your Personal Information.
AND CO may employ and contract with people and other entities that perform     certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”).     We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to     provide the Services to You. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do     not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we     share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent     to our sharing of Your Personal Information with our Agents.
Finally, AND CO may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of     transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business     assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired,     or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be     one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You     acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or     our assets may continue to use Your Personal Information as set forth in     this policy.
You may request access to Your Personal Information:
It is Your responsibility to ensure that the Personal Information You     provide to us is accurate, complete and up-to-date. You may request access     to the Personal Information we hold about You, or request that we update or     correct any Personal Information we hold about You, by setting out Your     request in writing and sending it to us at [email protected] .
AND CO will process Your request as soon as reasonably practicable,     provided we are not otherwise prevented from doing so on legal grounds. If     we are unable to meet Your request, we will let you know why. In some     circumstances, it may be necessary for us to seek to arrange access to Your     Personal Information through a mutually agreed intermediary (for example,     the Subscriber).
We’ll only keep Your Personal Information for as long as we require it for     the purposes of providing You with the Services. However, we may also be     required to keep some of Your Personal Information for specified periods of     time, for example under certain laws relating to corporations, money     laundering, and financial reporting legislation.

Please note that requesting to be removed from one mailing list may not     result in Your being removed from all mailing lists to which You are     subscribed. You may need to send separate requests to be removed from each     specific mailing list to which You are subscribed.
You are responsible for transfer of Your data to third-party       applications:
