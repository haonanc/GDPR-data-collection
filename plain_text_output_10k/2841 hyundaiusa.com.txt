Information We Collect Automatically
We also collect certain information from users of the Site automatically when they visit.  We may collect such information in the following ways:
Cookies
We may collect certain preference information of website users through the use of HTTP cookies which are small files stored on your web browser in order to optimize the design of the Site. Cookies enable us to track and aggregate user behavior data so that we may better target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on the Site. You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.
Web Beacons
Some of our web pages, commercial email messages and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel GIFs. Web beacons collect information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. Web beacons are a technique we may use to enhance and personalize the Site and the products and Services we offer, to provide product information and advertisements that are more relevant to your interests, compile aggregated statistics about the usage of the Site and to track the number of users who have opened and acted upon our commercial email messages.
Web Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising
A number of technologies exist to analyze use of the Site, assess consumer behavior and serve relevant ads to consumers online. Hyundai employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons, third-party analytics services, and third party interest-based advertising services. These technologies allow us to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. Many of these technologies are provided to Hyundai via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior. For example, our analytics service providers may use cookies or other technologies to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information about Site visitor behavior. The information generated by your browser use, stored via cookies, log files, and other information sources (including IP address), is transmitted to our analytics service providers. We may also obtain information from our advertising partners about your interaction with our marketing campaigns across websites, devices, platforms, and environments. This information is then used to evaluate visitors’ use of the Site, to compile statistical reports on website activity for Hyundai, and to review the efficacy of marketing campaigns. We may aggregate this Non-Personally Identifiable Information with other information for analytics purposes. Our third-party advertising partners on this Site may also use browser and device tracking technologies (HTTP cookies, web beacons, advertising IDs, etc.) to collect and measure non-personally identifiable data about your browsing behaviors. We use these interest-based advertising vendors serve relevant advertising across the Internet and other platforms and environments (including television). If you would like to know more about interest-based advertising, or opt-out of interest-based advertising conducted by our partners, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance .
Third Party Advertisers

Unlike cookies and web beacons used by Hyundai in content it controls on the Site, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within the Site and they may use information (not including Personally Identifiable Information) about your visits to the Site and other websites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share certain information with their clients such as date and time the banner ad was shown you, the specific ad shown and the IP address.
Log Files

Contact information (name, address, city, state and zip code, email address, telephone number)

For example, we may send you email messages to invite you to join a contest Program. Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be shared with our business partner and may also be used by our business partner if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that company. If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies and this Privacy Policy will not apply to that company’s use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Privacy Policy, those applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us (or our business partners) with any Personally Identifiable Information.
For Audit and Legal Purposes
Hyundai may disclose any Personally Identifiable Information or Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected to any person performing audit, legal, operational or other similar services for Hyundai. Hyundai may also disclose any Personally Identifiable Information or Non-Personally Identifiable Information when required to do so by subpoena, court order, or warrant. Hyundai will also disclose any Personally Identifiable Information or Non-Personally Identifiable Information deemed necessary to protect the safety of an individual, the public, or the security and reliability of Hyundai and the Site.
Participating Vendors
Some of our websites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On websites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we may also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.
Credit Card Companies; Third Party Payment Services; Third Party Promotional Sites
In some cases, we use third party payment and transaction services to facilitate your transactions and process your orders. In such cases, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information and credit card information with third party payment services companies solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order. In some cases, we will share your Personally Identifiable Information and credit card information with third parties who may offer you a gift or promotional offer as a result of your interest.

Hyundai will not otherwise provide any Personally Identifiable Information to your credit card company.
