The Big Think, Inc. ("Big Think") knows that you care about how your             personal information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously.             Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By             visiting the Big Think's website at http://www.bigthink.com             ("bigthink.com"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you             accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers Big Think's treatment of personally identifiable             information ("Personal Information") that Big Think gathers when you are             accessing bigthink.com and when you use our services. This policy does not             apply to the practices of companies that Big Think does not own or control,             or to individuals that Big Think does not employ or manage.
What Personal Information Does Big Think display or Collect?
The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve             our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile             that can be used to interact with other users through bigthink.com. In             connection with bigthink.com, we request and display some personal             information to other users and visitors of bigthink.com, which allows users             to identify each other.
We collect the following types of information from our users.
Personal Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on bigthink.com or                     provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information                     collected include or may include in the future your name, age, gender,                     e-mail address, income, and hometown. You may choose not to provide us                     with certain information, but then you may not be able to take                     advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information                     you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests                     for certain information, products and services, customizing the                     advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about                     specials and new features. You may modify or remove any of your                     personal information at any time by logging into your account and                     accessing features to edit your profile and account information.
Personal Information Collected Automatically: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you                     interact with bigthink.com or obtain services from us. Big Think                     automatically receives and records information on our server logs from                     your browser including your IP address, Big Think cookie information,                     and the page you requested. We also record the details of your                     transactions on bigthink.com.
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such                     as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its                     components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people                     watched a particular show. Big Think only uses this data in aggregate                     form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that                     would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us                     to figure out how often users use parts of bigthink.com or services so                     that we can make bigthink.com appealing to as many users as possible,                     and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may                     provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users,                     collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so                     that our partners also understand how often people use their services                     and bigthink.com, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal                     online experience. Again, Big Think never discloses aggregate                     information to a partner in a manner that would identify you                     personally.
E-mail Communications: We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Big Think                     if your computer supports this type of program. Big Think uses this                     confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We                     also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in                     an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.

These cookies allow the ad server to             recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to             compile information about you or others who use your computer. This             information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted             advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This             Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Big Think and does not cover             the use of cookies by any advertisers.

You hereby                     consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.

Users' full names                     will not be directly revealed to other users by Big Think, however, to                     facilitate searching Contributor Submissions, Big Think allows users                     to search for other users by using information users provide in their                     profile.
Communication in response to Contributor Submissions: As part                     of bigthink.com and Services, you will receive from Big Think and                     other users e-mail and other communication relating to your                     Contributor Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Service). You                     acknowledge and agree that by posting such Contributor Submissions,                     Big Think and other users may send you e-mail and other communication                     that they determine in their sole discretion relate to your                     Contributor Submissions.
Promotional Offers: Big Think allows users the option of                     having daily email alerts sent to them if there is any activity from                     other users on the ideas they have submitted to the site. Users can                     opt-in to these email alerts by choosing to receive them upon                     registration. Subsequently, users can opt out of the email alerts by                     choosing not to receive them from the settings page of their Big Think                     account.
We do not currently send offers to users on behalf of other                     businesses, but reserve the right to do so.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or                     sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is                     typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if                     Big Think, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the                     unlikely event that Big Think goes out of business or enters                     bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is                     transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such                     transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Big Think may continue                     to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
Protection of Big Think and Others: We may release Personal                     Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to                     comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other                     agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Big Think,                     our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without                     limitation, exchanging information with other companies and                     organizations for fraud protection.
With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be                     notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third                     parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this                     information.
