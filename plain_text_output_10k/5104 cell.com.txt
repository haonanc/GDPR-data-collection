Privacy Policy:
Cellcom inc. ("Cellcom")         operates Cellcom.ie and may operate other websites. It         is Cellcom's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect         while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Cellcom collects non-personally-identifying information of the         sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,         referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Cellcom's purpose in         collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand         how Cellcom's visitors use its website. From time to         time, Cellcom may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by         publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Cellcom also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol         (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Cellcom.ie        blogs/sites. Cellcom only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same         circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that         commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site         where the comment was left.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Cellcom's websites choose to interact         with Cellcom in ways that require Cellcom to gather         personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Cellcom gathers         depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at Cellcom.ie to provide a         username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Cellcom are asked to         provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to         process those transactions. In each case, Cellcom collects such information only insofar as         is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with   Cellcom. Cellcom does not disclose personally-identifying information         other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with         the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Cellcom may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its         websites. Cellcom may display this information publicly or provide it to others.         However, Cellcom does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as         described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Cellcom discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information         only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information         in order to process it on Cellcom's behalf or to provide services available         at Cellcom's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some         of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by         using Cellcom's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to         them. Cellcom will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and         personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated         organizations, as described above, Cellcom discloses potentially personally-identifying and         personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or         when Cellcom believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the         property or rights of Cellcom, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered         user of an Cellcom website and have supplied your email address, Cellcom        may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to         date with what's going on with Cellcom and our products. If you send us a request (for         example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us         clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cellcom takes all         measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of         potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Cookies
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser         provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Cellcom uses cookies to         help Cellcom identify and track visitors, their usage of Cellcom        website, and their website access preferences. Cellcom visitors who do not wish to have         cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before         using Cellcom's websites, with the drawback that certain features         of Cellcom's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Business Transfers
If Cellcom, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event         that Cellcom goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the         assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that         any acquirer of Cellcom may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this         policy.
Ads
Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.         These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to         compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among         other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy         Policy covers the use of cookies by Cellcom and does not cover the use of cookies by any         advertisers.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Cellcom may change         its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Cellcom's sole         discretion. Cellcom encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to         its Privacy Policy. If you have a Cellcom.ie account, you might also         receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in         this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
