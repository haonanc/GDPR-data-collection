Payette Forward Privacy Policy
Why Does Payette Forward Have A Privacy Policy?
In short, we’re required to have a privacy policy because we allow you to post comments using your Facebook account instead of having to create yet another account for this site. Facebook requires us to have a privacy policy, but it’s a good idea anyway.
The long and short of it is that we don’t know who you are, but we use Google Analytics to see where you’re coming from by anonymously collecting your zip code – we don’t get any closer than that. If you want us to know who you are, you’ll tell us. We don’t give away or sell any of your information to third-parties or advertisers or do any of that sort of thing. We only want to be helpful. Thanks for understanding and Contact Payette Forward if you have any questions at all.
