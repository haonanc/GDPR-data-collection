At Parchment Inc. (“Parchment”) we take your privacy seriously. We have developed this Privacy Policy to clearly describe how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information as we provide our services and tools on or via this website, www.parchment.com , and its affiliated websites (“the Site”), collectively referred to herein as “Services.” The Services include the electronic ordering, fulfillment, and delivery of academic credentials and data, including without limitation, transcripts and related admissions documents, diplomas, test score reports, certificates and certifications (collectively, “Credentials”) and the electronic awarding of Credentials.
By accessing and using our Site or by clicking “I accept” prior to your registration on the Parchment Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your information and personal data by Parchment as described in this Privacy Policy.
What Information do we collect?
Automatic collection of information. Like many websites on the Internet, we automatically gather certain non-personally identifiable information and store it in log files. This information may include, for example, your IP address, browser type, and Internet connection speed. In addition, we may employ the use of “cookies” in certain areas of our Site. We use this information, which does not identify individual users through such users’ personally-identifiable information (PII) defined as data that we collect that could identify a single individual (including names, email addresses, postal addresses, and phone numbers), but does differentiate between users (as described in greater detail below) to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Parchment and our partners, affiliates, or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.
Cookies.
We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Site.
We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits the Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on the Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
Cookies we use.
Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:

We may create anonymous data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect.  We make personal information into anonymous data by excluding information that makes the data personally identifiable to you.
Sensitive Personal Data.
We do not collect and we ask that you do not send us or disclose any sensitive personal data (e.g. information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other beliefs, health, biometrics, or criminal background) on or through the Services, with the exception of certain services on the Site where some users may opt in to providing ethnicity in order to participate in such service offering.

If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such user generated content in our Services.
Anonymous Information.
We may use anonymous information in aggregate form to provide institutions with analytics on Credential exchange activity through the Services, including analysis to track where requests are coming from and going to, and benchmarking information. Additionally, we may use anonymous information in aggregate form to provide users with certain admissions-related analytics. These analytics rely solely on aggregated, anonymized data, and do not include any data from the Credentials we process.
We may use a third party to assist us in collecting and analyzing information as described below.
In addition, we use that anonymous data for our lawful business purposes.
How we share your information?
Our business hinges on security and the trust you place in us. We take great care to ensure that your personally identifiable information is only shared in the following limited circumstances:
Designated Institutions or Third Parties. When a student, academic institution, or other user uses our Services, we will access certain data, including personal information, and may transmit, fulfill, or otherwise disclose Credentials and related data to such other academic institutions or third parties as authorized by such user. The consent of a student-user’s parent may be required to submit a Credential request for non-postsecondary students under the age of 18. We will share certain information with the institutions from which we obtain your Credentials in order to fulfill your order.
Service providers. We may also use other companies and individuals to perform supporting functions on our behalf for the institutions that we work with or for the various Services offered through the Site, such as account billing and processing. They handle data only in compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, and will not be permitted to use the information collected from you for any purpose other than performing the support functions for Parchment.
 
 
Academic Research. We may share anonymous data with researchers at academic institutions for academic research purposes, including the study of topics of relevance to the admissions process, college access, and labor market outcomes. Researchers and academic institutions are only permitted to handle such data in compliance with the terms of a restricted use agreement with Parchment; additionally, such academic institutions must be accredited and the research must be approved by the researching institution’s institutional review board (IRB), passing review of the methods proposed for research to ensure that they are ethical.
Protection of rights. We may disclose your information if we believe that such action is appropriate to: (i) comply with law or any lawful requests and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities, (ii) enforce the Terms of Use Agreement for the Site or this Privacy Policy, (iii) respond to claims that any information or content posted on our site or transmitted through the use of the Services violates the rights of any third party, or (iv) protect the rights, privacy, property, or personal safety of Parchment, its affiliates and employees, other Site users or others, or (v) protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity. .
Business transfers. Parchment may sell, transfer, or otherwise share your information to an acquirer, assignee or other successor entity in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the equity, business, or assets of Parchment to which your information relates, or in connection with a sale, merger, bankruptcy, reorganization, change in control, or other similar transaction.
International Data Transfer
 
 
European Union users should read the important information provided here about transfer of personal information outside of the European Economic Area.
Storage of information
Once a Credential request has been fulfilled, Parchment does not retain such Credential, unless requested by the individual user, the sending institution, or the receiving institution, for the convenience of such user. For example, it is Parchment’s policy to comply with the sending institution’s preferences until the Credential is delivered. After the Credential is delivered, Parchment follows the receiver’s preferences regarding the retention and analysis of the transmitted Credential. If an individual user requests Parchment retain their Credentials on their behalf, Parchment will comply with such request and maintain the Credentials on behalf of such user in their personal account. Similarly, if an institution requests that Parchment store Credentials in the Parchment credential library, Parchment will comply with such request and maintain the Credentials on behalf of such institution in its credential library, subject to the applicable agreement between such institution and Parchment.
