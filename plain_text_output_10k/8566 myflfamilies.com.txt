I. Purpose of This Privacy Policy
Mead Johnson Nutrition respects the privacy of its customers, including visitors to its websites, and understands that information about you, your health, and your health care is sensitive. Mead Johnson Nutrition will not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes, except as provided in the “Transfer of Control” subsection of this Privacy Policy. Mead Johnson Nutrition developed this Privacy Policy to provide information about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide when using the Enfamil website (which includes the Enfamil Online Shop and the Enfamil mobile website) and the Enfamil mobile apps. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy before submitting information or using this website or the mobile apps. By submitting information or using this website or the mobile apps, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is data specifically about you, which you typically provide on a voluntary basis. Aggregate or combined information includes data that is related to you but studied as a group and does not identify you specifically. You cannot “opt-out” from having aggregate information collected except as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.
II. Information We Collect
Information You Voluntarily Provide on the Website
You can visit much of our website without telling us who you are or providing us with other Personal Information. Some areas of our website allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments, including via surveys from our service providers. When you communicate with us and request a response, we ask for your name and contact information so that we may respond to you. Some areas of our website may also require that you submit information to access specific content, features, interactive tools, services, or participate in a particular activity. For example, to create an online account for the Enfamil Online Shop or to subscribe to an email newsletter, we may ask for certain Personal Information such as your name, contact information, address, credit card information if you are making a purchase, and perhaps additional information so we can tailor our response to your request. In addition, when you access certain interactive tools or service, you may be asked to provide Personal Information. Other features of the website, such as the profile update feature, may ask you to provide information such as your education level or certain medical information regarding you, your infant, or your child. You may always choose not to provide the requested information, but then you may not be able to participate in the particular activity that requires the information.
Information You Voluntarily Provide on the Mobile Apps
Certain features and tools may be developed for the Enfamil mobile apps that may collect certain information from you. If you provide such information for these mobile app-specific tools and features, we will not use such information except to provide you with those tools and features. For example, the Birth Announcement Creator tool may ask you for your baby’s name, time and date of birth, length, weight and photo to create a birth announcement for you. In addition, the mobile apps may provide enable you to choose to share certain information with certain third parties, such as via Facebook or email.
Note that if you visit the Enfamil website on your mobile device (separate from the Enfamil mobile apps), the portions of this Privacy Policy applicable to the website will apply.
Information We Automatically Collect
If you use the Enfamil website, we will automatically gather and store certain information about your visit, such as your IP address and your browser type, which is in addition to and separate from any Personal Information that you provide. We may collect this information through the use of cookies, web beacons, and log files. Through our log files, our website keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from (i.e., your IP address, domain name), date and time of the page request, the referring website (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). None of this automatically collected information is deemed to be Personal Information.
III. Use and Disclosure of Your Information

Our service providers may compile and use non-personally identifiable aggregated data to provide the services. We may also share your information with other Mead Johnson Nutrition companies who might invite you to participate in one of their programs.
We may also disclose your Personal Information as necessary (1) if we determine a website or policy violation has occurred, or to enforce the Enfamil Terms of Use; (2) if we believe such disclosure is necessary to identify, contract or bring legal action regarding injury or interference with the rights and property of Mead Johnson Nutrition, including to enforce Mean Johnson Nutrition’s rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to Mean Johnson Nutrition’s information technology assets or against other inappropriate use of the website or mobile apps; (3) to comply with laws, regulations, court orders and subpoenas or similar requests for information by authorities, or as otherwise required by law (including as described in the “Regulatory Requirements” subsection below); (4) to protect your safety and the safety of others; and (5) to assist us in fraud prevention or investigation.

California Do-Not-Track Disclosures

Note that opting out of marketing emails will not prevent you from receiving transactional emails (e.g., emails relating to your Enfamil Online Shop order). In addition, Mead Johnson Nutrition may still contact you in the event of a service or safety notification (e.g., a recall notice), regardless of your stated privacy preferences.
Except as limited in the Regulatory Requirements section of this Privacy Policy, you may update, correct your Personal Information or opt-out from our mailings and other services that you may have previously requested, by contacting us through the email address or phone number listed in the Contact Us section of this Privacy Policy.
