We know that your privacy is very important to you.
The University of Tennessee recognizes the concerns of individuals regarding privacy and online data collection. We strive to respect and protect the privacy expectations of our website visitors.
Most websites collect some information regarding visitors. Types of information collected are wide-ranging, and are collected both passively (by the web servers that host the websites) and actively (via user input through forms, surveys, etc.).
Some of the information collected allows site owners to determine who a particular visitor is and to track their behavior within and across a website domain.
However, most of the information collected cannot identify you as a particular individual and is only collected in aggregate.
Websites within the University of Tennessee website domain, tennessee.edu likewise collect information regarding site visitors. This statement outlines the types of information (data) collected, our methods for collecting data, and the reasons we collect data.
Aggregate Information
The following are examples of information that may be collected in aggregate to provide communications staff, site owners, content managers, designers, and IT specialists insight into visitor behavior for the purpose of improving university websites and access to university information.
The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer and name of the Internet domain used to access the Internet;
IP addresses of websites linking directly to sites within the tennessee.edu domain;
The date and time a site was accessed within the tennessee.edu domain;
Pages visited (“requested”) during this session;
Web browser and operating system used to access a site within the tennessee.edu domain;

University of Tennessee websites commonly use one of the following methods to collect this data:
Cookies
Cookies are files that many websites transfer to users’ web browsers to enable the site to deliver personalized services or to provide persistent authentication. The information contained in a cookie typically includes information collected automatically by the web server and/or information provided voluntarily by the user. Our website uses persistent cookies in conjunction with a third party technology partner to analyze search engine usage and web traffic patterns. This information is used in the aggregate to monitor and enhance our web pages.  It is not used to track the usage patterns of individual users.
Users may set preferences regarding the storage of cookies within their individual web browsers, which can also be used to remove stored cookies.
Third-party Tracking (e.g. Google Analytics)
Many websites within the tennessee.edu domain use Google Analytics to collect visitor data in aggregate. This data is also collected using cookies set by Google. See Google’s privacy and terms with regard to partner sites for more info: google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
The University of Tennessee may also transmit non-Personally identifiable information (NPII) collected by third-party tracking services (cookies) to other third parties (e.g. Facebook) so that you may see messages from the university when you visit other websites outside of the tennessee.edu domain.
Users can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by blocking third party cookies and tracking mechanisms via browser or operating system settings, browser plugins, or using a service such as aboutads.info/choices or youronlinechoices.eu/ .
Server logs
All web servers collect very basic visitor information to monitor site usage and performance.
Lawful Basis for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data
UT is an institution of higher education involved in education, research, and public service.  In order for UT to educate its students both in class and on-line, engage in research, and provide public service, it is essential, necessary, and UT has lawful bases to collect, process, use, and maintain data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its educational, research, and public service programs.
