Google Remarketing
Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website’s owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes, so you may see advertisements for our products as you search the Internet. For this to happen Google or other emarketing providers will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. (This can only happen if your browser is set to let it happen).
You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies and remarketing at this link: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en or you opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/
Facebook Remarketing
Our website uses Facebook’s remarketing advertising service. With remarketing, you may see ads for our products which you have previously looked at when you use Facebook. For this to happen Facebook uses a Custom Audience Pixel that is activated when a visitor lands on a webpage and a unique “cookie” is placed in their browser. To opt out of Facebook remarketing visit: https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217
