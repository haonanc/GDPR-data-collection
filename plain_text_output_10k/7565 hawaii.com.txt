Privacy Policy
Introduction
Hawaii.com (the “Service”) is owned and operated by Oahu Publications, Inc. d.b.a. Hawaii.com, and contains material which is derived in whole or in part from The Honolulu Star-Advertiser and other sources.
This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect from all sources, including in connection with our websites, mobile sites, events, contests, and electronic newsletters or communications.
This Privacy Policy also explains the types of personal data we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and how we keep the data safe. Your decision to use the Service and provide your personal information is voluntary. Hawaii.com is catered for the general audience, and does not target, and do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age.
What We Collect
Hawaii.com and our service providers collect personal data in order to create your account or provide services you have requested. We use various technologies like cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and databases to collect and store information. The data Hawaii.com and our service providers collect may include the following:
Information You Provide to Us
Hawaii.com may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply either while on the Hawaii.com Web site or in responding, via e-mail to a feature provided on the Hawaii.com Web site. Some examples of this type of information include: demographic information that you electronically submit when you sign up for access to certain features on the Service, information (such as your name or e-mail address) that you electronically submit when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests on the Hawaii.com Web site, information that you post on message boards on the Hawaii.com Web site, and information contained in search requests or questions that you submit to the Hawaii.com Web site. If you decline to supply or provide Hawaii.com with certain information while using the Service, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of the features offered through the Service.
Personal information you voluntarily provided such as your name, e-mail address, birthdate, phone number, gender, social network data, number of children (for vacation packages), and postal code may be collected depending on the services you’re using.
Social media services, and other third parties, may also provide personal information like location, IP address, profile picture, and other information they share with us. By connecting your social media account to your Hawaii.com account, you are authorizing Hawaii.com to collect, store and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For other third party services we use for analytics and sending emails, they may also provide us data about your browser, device, email opens, and email clicks.
Information that is Automatically Collected.
Hawaii.com also collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Hawaii.com Website. For example, to enhance your experience on the Hawaii.com Web site, Hawaii.com uses a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie.” Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Hawaii.com Web site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Hawaii.com Web site where you have entered preference information before. Hawaii.com also uses web beacons (also known as “single-pixel GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Hawaii.com Web site or open Hawaii.com’s HTML-formatted email messages. Another example of information that Hawaii.com automatically collects as you navigate the Hawaii.com Web site is information about your computer’s connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our Web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Hawaii.com Web site.
We also collect data that does not reveal your specific identity to us, such as browser information, device, usage data, data collected from cookies and other technologies, demographic information, geolocation data, obtained with your consent where required by applicable law, and aggregated information. These data are collected from our service providers through cookies and other tracking technologies
How Hawaii.com Uses Your Personal Information and Other Data
Personal information collected through the site are primarily used to deliver you the services you have requested. Data are also used to personalize and customize our services such as birthday greetings and points. Information collected from analytics also help us measure performance and improve your experience using the Service. Understanding usage across platforms keeps us informed of what features are useful, what features we should add, and what features we need to improve.
We also use your contact information to contact you for customer support, newsletters you’ve signed up, or notifications related to our products and services. We also use the information you’ve submitted to us through sign-ups, forms, and contests to give you updates and information about Hawaii. Some forms give you options to sign up to newsletters or email campaigns from our advertisers. Hawaii.com understands and respects your privacy. If you want to opt-out on any of our emails, you can log in and update your email preferences or email us at help@hawaii.com .
Please also keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online — for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas — that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides Hawaii.com. Hawaii.com cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third party use of information that you disclose online.
The Hawaii.com Web site includes links to other Web sites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another Web site or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.
We also make some content, products and services available through our Service through cooperative relationships with third party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear prominently on Hawaii.com. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly; in which cases the privacy policy of the provider partner may apply to the provider partner’s use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider directly for more information.
