General Purpose:
Bombas has developed this Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") to demonstrate its commitment to protecting the personal and private information of those using the www.bombassocks.com Website (the “Website”). Bombas, including its affiliates, is committed to protecting the privacy of users of our Website. This statement sets forth how we gather personally identifying information from users of our Website and how we use that information (e.g., your name, age, address, telephone and cell number, email address). When you provide personal information through our Website, the information may be sent to secure network servers located in the United States and/or other countries.
Acceptance of Privacy Policy:
By accessing the Website, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Website. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Each time you use the Website, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the Website, you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears above) and review any changes since the last version.
Collection, Disclosure and Use of Your Communications:
We gather information on our users in two ways: (1) tracking pages visited and (2) collecting information from voluntary submissions. We may use various technologies as well (e.g., cookies) to collect information from your computer and about your activities on our Website. We collect aggregate information on which pages of our Website that users access or visit.
Information Collected Through Voluntary Submissions:
We also collect and store any information that you voluntarily submit to us via registration. If you identify yourself by sending us an email, we collect and store your email address and any other information you provide in your email. We use this information for internal purposes and to contact you and/or send you information, including marketing information about our products. If you provide us with your postal address, we may contact you and/or send you information via your postal address. If you provide us with your telephone number, we may contact you by telephone.
Sharing of Information:
We use the information collected for internal purposes, including to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our Website and to determine how best to enhance the usability of our Website. We do not make available any information that we collect from you to any organizations or companies other than Bombas and its affiliates. However, we may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our Website functionality and supporting other features offered through our Website. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.

Future Uses of Information:
From time to time, we may use your personally identifying information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Website periodically.
Third-Party Websites:
There are a number of places on our Website where you may click on a link to access another party’s website that does not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our Website, you may be taken to a third party website that we have no ownership or control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect from you and in some instances provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy policy (if any) of all third-party websites you visit.
