We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the Apps) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.
Through your use of the Apps  
When you download and use the Apps, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.
Physical Location Information
Our Services and HTML-formatted emails include features that may require collecting different types of location information (such as IP Address, GPS coordinates or postal code) that we then use for the specific feature you have selected, such as:
Where to Buy and Store Locator.  Some of our Services allow you to search for the nearest store that offers the Stanley Black & Decker product that you want and whether such nearby stores have certain of our items in stock.  If you access one of our Sites or Apps through a mobile device and you have enabled location-based services, location information may be collected for these features, by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or WiFi signals.  If you access these features through a desktop device, you can choose to have your browser provide us your location information based on your IP Address to respond to your request, or you may be asked to provide us with your location information. The specificity of the desktop device location information can vary depending on the browser you are using and how you are connected to the internet. Your mobile device settings may allow you to disable location-based services, which will prevent our Sites and Apps from accessing your precise mobile device location information.  We recommend you review the help or user manual provided with your device for instructions.
Email.  Our emails use your IP Address to determine the postal code where you are located when you open the email.  This allows us to tailor content to you, such as a map of nearby stores carrying our products. The specificity of the location can vary depending on the device used to open our emails. Your email program may allow you to prevent the pixel tags or images in the emails you receive from us from downloading, which will also prevent our service provider from accessing your location information.  You can also unsubscribe from receiving our emails, as described in Section 6 below.
Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Services.  This section applies to additional personal information that may be collected, used, and disclosed related to our Bluetooth® enabled products and related Services (collectively our “Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Services”).  If you access our Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Services through a mobile device, we may collect and use your mobile device’s location services and Bluetooth® capabilities to identify the date, time and location of your mobile device when it was last in Bluetooth® range of a registered, Bluetooth® Enabled Product.  This is done to assist you in locating a registered Bluetooth® Enabled Product.  We may also collect location information about your registered Bluetooth® Enabled product as sent to us via other users’ mobile devices, and location information about other users’ registered Bluetooth® Enabled products as sent to us via your mobile device.  (Bluetooth® is a registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Stanley Black & Decker is under license). You may avoid collection of this data by disallowing the Services from accessing Bluetooth® on your device through your device settings or in some cases, at the time you install the App, but we may not be able to provide all features of the Services to you.
We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
If you do not consent to provide location information or you disable location-based services on your mobile device, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip or postal code.  Your desktop or mobile device settings may allow you to disable or block location-based services, which will prevent our Services from accessing your location information.   We recommend you review the help information or user manual provided with your device or browser for instructions. If you chose not to provide this information you may not be provided with content specific to your location and we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
