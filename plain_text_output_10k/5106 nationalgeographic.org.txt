Your Privacy Rights
Privacy Policy Introduction
The National Geographic Society, nationalgeographic.org, understands the importance of your privacy, and we take our responsibility to protect it seriously. Our Privacy Policy tells you what information we collect about you when you visit this website or use an online application that contains a link to this Privacy Policy (the “Services”). Our Privacy Policy also tells you how we use, share and protect this information; what choices you have about how this information is used; and how you can access and update this information. Certain aspects of this Privacy Policy also apply to the personally identifiable information we collect offline.
 
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) using our Services please note:
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new comprehensive data protection law that updates existing EU laws to strengthen the protection of “personal data” (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, so called “data subjects”) in light of rapid technological developments, the increasingly global nature of business and more complex international flows of personal data. The GDPR replaces the current patchwork of national data protection laws with a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state. The GDPR takes effect on May 25, 2018. In addition to this Privacy Policy, if you would like to know more about how we, and our partner organization National Geographic Partners, LLC, are implementing  the GDPR please visit our Frequently Asked Questions  http://help.nationalgeographic.com/customer/en/portal/topics/1113429-gdpr-faqs/articles .
We may need to collect and process certain personal information as described in this Policy in order to provide the Services to you, or because we are legally required to do so. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide the Services to you.  We may use this information only for legitimate business reasons described in this Policy. 
We do not knowingly permit children in the EEA under age 16 to register for any content, product or Service. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information about users under age 16, except as permitted by law. 
We keep your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you; (ii) as required by a legal obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) as advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard of applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).
 
Information You Provide Directly to National Geographic Society
If you are interested in obtaining information, products or services from National Geographic Society, or in participating in certain activities related to the Services, you may need to provide us with information about yourself. For example: 
If you order a product from us, we ask for your name, postal address, email address, telephone number and your credit card number. 
If you are ordering a product as a gift for another person, we will ask you for that person’s name, postal address and phone number in order to enable us to deliver the gift to the recipient. 
If you participate in an activity such as a survey or sweepstakes, we may also ask you to provide other types of information such as gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information that we have obtained about you. To enhance and customize your experience with our Services 
 
Information We Collect Automatically 
In addition to information you choose to provide to us, we also use standard Internet technologies to collect automatically certain additional information. For example: 
IP Address or Device Identifier. When you come to our Services, we collect your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which identifies the computer or service provider that you use to access the Services or your mobile device identifier, if you connect through a mobile device. We may use these identifiers to collect information regarding the frequency with which specific visitors visit various parts of our Services. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information that we have collected to make our Services and our communications to you more targeted to your interests. 
Cookies. Our site also uses cookies. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer and allow websites to remember information about users. We use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to enhance the quality of our Site. We use transient (also called “session ID”) cookies to provide continuity from page to page. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies. Persistent cookies allow our online store and certain other parts of our Site to recognize your browser when you return after your first visit to that part of our Site. Cookies allow us to personalize your return visits to our Site and to save you time during certain activities, such as checking out from our online store. You have the choice to set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) It is up to you whether to allow us to send you cookies. However, if you do not accept cookies from us, your ability to use some areas of our Site will be limited, such as our shopping cart feature or online games.
Web beacons and other technologies. The Services uses other tracking tools, including web beacons. Web beacons are images on the Services (or in emails that the Services sends to you) that help us determine what parts of the Services you have visited, whether you have opened an email that we have sent to you, or otherwise to measure the effectiveness of the Services. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information directly to us or to a service provider authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.
