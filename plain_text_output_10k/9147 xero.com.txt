The defined terms in this Policy have the same meaning as in our Terms of Use , which You should read together with this Policy. By accessing our Website and using our Service, You consent to the terms of this Policy and agree to be bound by it and our Terms of Use.
Xero collects Your personal information
Xero is a provider of beautiful online accounting software that’s simple, smart, and secure and gives business owners and their advisors real-time visibility of a business’ financial position.
The Service involves the storage of Data about a company or individual. That Data can include personal information. “Personal information” is information about an identifiable individual, and may include information such as the individual’s name, email address, telephone number, bank account details, taxation details, and accounting and financial information.
Xero may collect personal information directly from You when You:

You can always choose not to provide Your personal information to Xero, but it may mean that we are unable to provide You with the Service.
Xero may receive personal information from You about others
Through Your use of the Service, Xero may also collect information from You about someone else. If You provide Xero with personal information about someone else, You must ensure that You are authorised to disclose that information to Xero and that, without Xero taking any further steps required by applicable data protection or privacy laws, Xero may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described in this Policy.
This means that You must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of and/or consents to the various matters detailed in this Policy, including the fact that their personal information is being collected, the purposes for which that information is being collected, the intended recipients of that information, the individual's right to obtain access to that information, Xero’s identity, and how to contact Xero.
Where requested to do so by Xero, You must also assist Xero with any requests by the individual to access or update the personal information You have collected from them and entered into the Service.
Xero collects, holds, and uses Your personal information for limited purposes
Xero collects Your personal information so that we can provide You with the Service and any related services You may request. In doing so, Xero may use the personal information we have collected from You for purposes related to the Services including to:
verify Your identity,
administer the Service,
notify You of new or changed services offered in relation to the Service,
carry out marketing or training relating to the Service,
assist with the resolution of technical support issues or other issues relating to the Service,

It is Your responsibility to keep Your password to the Service safe. You should notify us as soon as possible if You become aware of any misuse of Your password, and immediately change your password within the Service or via the “Forgotten Password” process.

Xero holds your personal information on servers located in the United States of America (the U.S.)
We use top tier, third party data hosting providers’ (Rackspace, AWS, and Microsoft Azure) to host our Services on servers located in the U.S. If you are a non-U.S. resident, this means that your personal information will be transferred to the U.S.
We have in place transfer mechanisms with all our third party data hosting providers that satisfy the requirements relating to Xero’s transfer of data from the European Union to the U.S.
By entering personal information into the Services, you consent to that personal information being hosted on servers located in the U.S. While your personal information will be stored on servers located in the U.S., it will remain within Xero’s effective control at all times. Each data hosting provider’s role is limited to providing a hosting and storage service to Xero, and we’ve taken steps to ensure that our data hosting providers do not have access to, and use the necessary level of protection for, Your personal information. They do not control, and are not permitted to access or use your personal information, except for the limited purpose of storing the information. This means that, for the purposes of Australian privacy legislation and Australian users, Xero does not currently “disclose” personal information to third parties located overseas.
If You do not want Your personal information to be transferred to a server located in the U.S., You should not provide Xero with Your personal information or use the Service.

We will advise You at the first reasonable opportunity upon discovering or being advised of a security breach where Your personal information is lost, stolen, accessed, used, disclosed, copied, modified, or disposed of by any unauthorised persons or in any unauthorised manner.
