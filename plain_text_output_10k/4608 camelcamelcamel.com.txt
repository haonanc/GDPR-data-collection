We try to collect as little personal data from our users as possible, but we do typically require your email address in order to deliver price alerts and other site-related messages.  Please do not give us your email address if you do not want us to contact you.  We do not sell your email address or share it outside our company.  We will purge it from our database on request.  Easy enough.
There are, however, a few ways in which we utilize third party services to help run / fund the site:
Affiliate Marketing. When you buy a product through our site, Amazon pays us a percentage of each sale.  This does not impact your price in any way, and helps pay to keep the site online.
Advertising. This typically involves embedding a script from one or more ad networks into our pages, which then display ads that may might be relevant to the viewer.  If you don't like the sound of that, please feel free to use an ad blocker (and maybe consider making a donation .)
Analytics. Our web traffic is also analyzed by third party companies, for our own internal reporting and server monitoring.
Ad networks and analytics companies generally try to build viewer profiles to better target their advertising and/or improve their web traffic analyses, so these companies may have more of your personal data. Click here to view our full vendor list.
