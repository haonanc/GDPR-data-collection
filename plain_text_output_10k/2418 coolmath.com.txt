We Collect Information Passively
For our traffic tracking, we use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. These services use cookies (not the yummy kind) to help us understand our traffic. The information gathered is anonymous and is never tied to any information that may personally identify you. We use this data to understand things like what pages have been visited and how long our users stay on our site. This information is used only for internal purposes and is invaluable to us because it lets us know what you like and want more of, so we can continue to make Coolmath better. It's also really important for us to be able to understand our traffic so we know when we need to upgrade our servers! Without this info, we wouldn't have a clue!
