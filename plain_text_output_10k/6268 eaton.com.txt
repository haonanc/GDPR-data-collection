Beyond the Tipping Point
Massive increases in renewable energy generation mean that we must start planning now for how to manage seasonal gaps with economic, low carbon solutions when there is not enough wind and solar power to meet peak demand.
A new Bloomberg New Energy Finance economic study, commissioned by Eaton in partnership with the Renewable Energy Association, models how fast this change is set to occur and the impact of short- and long-term seasonal generation gaps on today's grid, and in the high renewable futures predicted in 2030 and 2040.
 
 
 
 
 
Privacy, cookies and data protection policy
Eaton and its affiliates (collectively, “Eaton,” or “we,” “us,” “our”) respect your concerns about personal data protection and value our relationship with you. This Privacy, Cookies and Data Protection Policy (the “Policy”) applies solely to personal data collected through Eaton web sites, web pages, portals, interactive features, applications, telephone support lines, email, widgets, blogs and their respective contents in addition to our Twitter, Facebook or other social networking sites, and their respective contents (collectively, the “Sites”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other device (collectively, “Device”).
This Policy describes the types of personal data we collect through the Sites and how that personal data may be used and/or with whom it may be shared. This Policy also describes how you can reach us to update your contact information, access and control the use of the personal data we collect in connection with our marketing communications and activities, or get answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices at these Sites. Please read this Policy carefully, because by using the Sites you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy. In addition, please review our Terms & Conditions , which governs your use of the Sites and any content you submit to the Sites.
I. Cookies
Like many companies, Eaton uses “cookies” and similar tools on the Sites to improve their performance and enhance your user experience.
What are Cookies?
A cookie is a small text file which is placed on your Device. Cookies help to analyze web traffic and allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Certain cookies may contain personal data – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie may store your username. Most cookies won’t collect personal data that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information, such as how users arrive at and use our Sites, or a user’s general location.
What do we use Cookies for?
Eaton may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security purposes, to tell us whether you have visited the Sites before, to remember your language preferences, if you are new visitor or to otherwise facilitate site navigation, and to personalize your experience while visiting our Sites. Cookies allow us to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Sites and pages visited. Cookies also allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Sites. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular Site. Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better Site by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your Device or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.
What kinds of Cookies do we use?
Generally, the cookies that are used on the Sites can be broken down in to the following categories:
Session Cookies
These cookies are used 'in-session' each time you visit and then expire when you leave a Site or shortly thereafter: they are not stored on your Device permanently, do not contain any personal data and help by minimizing the need to transfer personal data across the internet. These cookies can be deleted or you can refuse to allow their use, but this will hamper the performance and your experience in using the Sites. These cookies also take time stamps that record when you access a Site and when you leave a Site.
Tracking Cookies
These cookies enable us to recognize repeat visitors to our Sites. By matching an anonymous, randomly generated identifier, a tracking cookie keeps track of where a user of our Sites came from, what search engine they may have used, what link they clicked on, what keyword they used and where they were in the world when they accessed a Site. By monitoring this data, we can make improvements to our Sites.
Persistent Cookies
This type of cookie is saved on your Device for a fixed period (sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to remember who you are for more than one browsing session. For example, this type of cookie can be used to store your preferences, so that they are remembered for the next visit to a Site.
Performance or Analytical Cookies
Performance cookies are used to analyze how the Sites are used and to monitor their performance, which allows us to improve your experience in using the Sites. These cookies help us to tailor the content of the Sites to reflect what the Site users find most interesting and to identify when technical issues with the Sites arise. We may also use this data to compile reports to help us to analyze how Sites are used, what the most common issues are and how we can improve the Sites.
Can the Cookies be blocked?
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies. However, please be aware that if you disable or reject cookies, some features and services on our Sites may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your Eaton account(s). In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.

1. INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR SITES

However there may be circumstances when you may be asked or choose to provide personal data that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (such as your name, home address, telephone number, credit card data or email address (“Personal Data”) through the Sites. For example, Eaton may collect Personal Data when you register on the Sites, request information, purchase products or services, supply products or services, submit a resume, comments or participate in some promotion, survey or other feature of the Sites, or otherwise communicate or interact with us.

Whenever you visit or interact with the Sites, Eaton may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Sites are accessed and used (“usage data”). Usage data may include, in part, browser type, operating system, the page served, the time, how many users visited the Sites, and the preceding page views. Usage data is statistical data which provides us with information about the use of the Sites, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Sites, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. This usage data helps us to keep the Sites fresh and interesting to our visitors and to tailor content to a visitor’s interests. Usage data is generally non-identifying, but if Eaton associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Eaton treats it as Personal Data.
