ZUMIEZ CUSTOMER PRIVACY POLICY
Updated May 24, 2018
In connection with the use of a specific website, application or other interactive service (“Services”) provided by Zumiez Inc. and/or any affiliates that Zumiez directly owns or controls (collectively, "affiliates"), this privacy policy governs the personal information and other information of yours that we may collect and use. For example, as a Zumiez customer, you may be asked for information like your name, address, email address or telephone number. We collect and use this personal information as set forth in this privacy policy.
The remainder of this privacy policy will provide you with details on the personal information we may collect from you and how we use it. It also discusses the options that you may have for how we can use your personal information.
To make reading easier we sometimes use short terms that have longer definitions or meanings so we have included a separate Appendix to describe those in more detail. Also, supplemental notices may be added to this privacy policy from time to time. For example, if you provide us with personal information because you are interested in a job, we may change or supplement this privacy policy with more or different terms in a supplemental notice or separate policy to address employment related concerns.
Personal information (or "PI") means information that personally identifies you, or that could reasonably be used to identify you.  The categories of PI that we may collect from you include:
✔ Contact PI such as name, postal or email address, or phone number. For example, we'll ask for: an address if you order a newsletter or catalog or join TheZumiezStash; a phone number to notify contest winners or to help authenticate you; your cell number if you sign up for SMS alerts; and your gender to help us anticipate your shopping needs or to make suggestions.
✔ Registration & Account PI such as PI you provide, or that we otherwise collect, when open an account with us.  Such PI includes things like your name, email, postal address, telephone, fax, order history, and birthday.  You may also provide additional PI if you choose to personalize your account, for example, by adding items to a wish list.
✔ Transactional PI for all purchases & returns. This includes things like credit, debit or gift card data, postal & email addresses, phone & fax numbers, IP or device addresses or identifiers, and other related information such as receipts, confirmations, shipping, billing, adjustments, loyalty programs and so on. This PI can be about you or others (such as a gift recipient's data).
✔ Activity or Qualification PI includes supplying PI to meet an age or experience limit, or indicating your likes or dislikes by clicking a "thumbs up/down" type of icon. Please note that if one of your activities is posting PI in publicly available areas (with us or with others), that information becomes public.  So please think before you post (because anyone may be able to see or copy it).
✔ PI you give us that we didn't request, such as PI that you voluntarily put into a message to us or that happens to be in a picture or video that you provide to us.
✔ Community PI, such as PI that you post in areas of our websites or applications, or in interactive areas or communities that we or others maintain, such as social media sites, when the information you post is accessible to other users or the public (for example, posting a product review or creating a tag).
✔ PI about others could include things like a picture you submit to us containing an image of a friend, or a friend’s contact information if you use a find a friend or refer a friend feature. Please don't submit PI about somebody else unless they've said okay and you've obtained their consent to this privacy policy (or unless you're otherwise authorized to provide their consent to it).
✔ Sensitive Data: This may consist of what you consider sensitive PI, such as financial related information, certain geo-location data or other stored information such as contacts, photos, and videos.
✔ Event PI such as a name badge or other attendance data. Event information varies with the event, but could include things like your hometown or emergency contact information.
✔ Promotional PI & Surveys. This is PI such as information relating to a survey or poll, contest, sweepstake, or other activity or promotion sponsored or presented by us alone or with others. This PI varies, but tends to include things like name, gender, email, postal code, birthday and mailing address (e.g., if a prize or catalog will be shipped).
Below are examples of types of PI we tend to collect from other sources or, indirectly, from you:
✔ PI from our previous records such as PI you gave us for one activity that we use for another (e.g., re-using data from one transaction to pre-populate fields in a subsequent transaction to decrease ordering hassle).
✔ PI we obtain from public or other sources, to the extent permitted by law, such as from phone books, websites, mobile applications, and other information that others may have about you.
✔ Indirect Transactional PI. When directly collecting "Transactional PI" we also indirectly collect information that is used for things such as fraud prevention or for authentication (e.g., time, date, store location, items purchased).
✔ Indirect PI. If you participate in an event or visit one of our retail locations, PI such as your image may be captured on surveillance cameras, which we use for safety, security and fraud prevention purposes.  If you deal with us (or those who help us) over the phone or in a "live" meeting we may record the conversation for quality, training and record keeping purposes.
✔ PI we may lawfully obtain from commercial providers of information such as a data broker, ad network, marketing participant and so on.
✔ Social Media PI. If you create or log into a Zumiez account using a social media platform, connect with us on social media, or use social media functionality that is imbedded into our Channels, the social media network usually shares some PI with us, in accordance with the social media network's privacy policy or other rules.  You may be able to control the amount and type of PI that is shared by changing your privacy settings on the social media platform.
✔ Metadata. Digital items often have embedded data that you might or might not know about. For example, a digital picture might have a record of where and when you took it. Unless you remove such data, it would be an example of PI we may collect and use.
When you visit one of our websites, such as zumiez.com, thezumiezstash.com, or zumiezbestfootforward.com (these and any others we own or operate are referred to as a "Site") or interact with us at one of our stores or at an event (this and our Sites and our Apps are collectively referred as "Channels"), we may use different kind of technologies for multiple reasons, including to improve your shopping experience, for example by reducing the amount of information required at checkout or by otherwise personalizing your experience with us. Here are some examples:
Browsers: a "browser" is essentially an application (such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari) used to access and view websites by processing HTML, the code used to help you see text, links and other items.
Cookies: "Cookies" are basically a small text file that we or others put on your access device so it can be used to help us serve you better by improving our website design, services, or promotions. They also recognize you (or your device) and may be used to deliver services or ads or otherwise collect some types of PI. There are several kinds of cookies, e.g., "session" cookies allow our Channels to collect information about what you do during a browsing session but are temporary and set to be deleted at the end of a session; "functional or persistent" cookies tend to last more than a session and are set to expire in a set number of days; and "performance" cookies are basically persistent cookies that collect data for managing performance and design issues. Some cookies operate with other technologies and there are more kinds of cookies. You may be able to set your browser to refuse cookies or to notify you before a cookie is set.  If you choose to refuse cookies or other technologies (if they can be refused), some access to or functionalities of a Channel might not work properly or may be slower or unavailable.
Tracking pixels or tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, API calls, SDKs, JavaScript and similar technologies are items that can function similarly to cookies or that otherwise assist tracking by collecting certain information about your interaction with our Channels (e.g., counting users who open an HTML-formatted email message, distinguishing visitors and counting pages they visit and authenticating them, etc.).
Identifiers, including unique identifiers such as an IP address (basically, this is a number that is automatically assigned to a device such as a computer by your Internet Service Provider); a Media Access Control (or "MAC") address which basically is a hardware ID number that is part of a network card such as a Wi-Fi or Ethernet card and that identifies each device on a network, or other identifiers (e.g., Android ID, Apple IDFA, or other identifiers that might otherwise relate to you or devices you use, or identifiers that are used by ads, advertisers, networks, platforms or other third parties). The above is not necessarily a complete list and we will change and add Technologies and Channels from time to time. Technologies are complex and can differ per Channel. Also, certain kinds of Technologies are likely to be used in multiple Channels.
Using the technologies described above, we may collect:
We may use third party technologies to collect information and when we do we work closely with these third parties to protect your PI. Third parties may offer some options that may be helpful to restrict some kinds of tracking. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices for not having this information used by third-party service providers, please visit: www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .
We reserve the right to collect information about you to the fullest extent allowed by the law, but set forth below are some examples of information that might be PI that can be collected by technologies we use.
• Information such as browser type and version; access device type (e.g., phone, tablet, laptop or whatever); operating system; Internet Service Provider; IP address, MAC address and/or other unique device identifier(s); phone number; hardware/software types, authentication data, demographic data, search history, screen resolution, and other data that might create a unique "fingerprint" or the like of your device.
• Domain name from which you came or a page, link, ad, website or source that referred you; time and date stamps; how long you stay and whether you are a return visitor; where and what you do in our Channel, including what's in your shopping cart and details of items purchased; clickstream data and clicks on particular items such as an ad; other acts you take and pages you view; account holder activities (e.g., if you have an account with TheZumiezStash, we track what you do to accumulate points); patterns (e.g., how often you come back to a Channel or features you tend to use) and so on.
• General location data (e.g., country or postal code) or precise location data (e.g., an App of ours like our App for TheZumiezStash might ask if it's okay to collect exactly where you are).
• Other types of information such as: user history on use of Apps; social media check-ins or other types of log in information at stores and/or events; coupon information, TheZumiezStash loyalty reward redemptions, etc.
In general, we reserve the right to use and otherwise disclose PI for every lawful purpose. Set forth below are some non-exclusive illustrations of how we tend to or may make use of PI.
We may collect and use your PI to provide you products and services, notify you of product recalls or safety issues, process and respond to your application for current or future career opportunities, to respond to your comments or questions, determine your satisfaction with our programs and service, to personalize your experiences, if you ask us to, send you marketing communications and other information you have chosen to receive regarding our products, services, marketing or special events. We may also use push notification on our Apps. We also may use your PI for our everyday business purposes such as security, payment processing, analytics, operations, fraud detection and prevention, reporting, making back-ups and legal compliance. In addition, we may also use the personal information you provide:
• To pre-populate a form for you such as populating address information at check out.
• To deal with companies or celebrities or other third parties that participate with us in events, promotions, videos, and other activities.
• To deal with Third Party Services and other service providers, including data analytic providers such as Google Analytics. Third parties that we use, or even just third parties that you might reach via links from our Channels, may have their own privacy policies or separate terms & conditions.
• To receive and review a question or request from you.
• To deal with our current or future affiliates. This may include things like the transfer of personal information and other information from Zumiez to one of its affiliates.
• To make common uses of it (i.e., uses that an ordinary reasonable person should expect or that are typically thought to be legally acceptable).
• To make extraordinary uses (e.g., in a merger or bankruptcy etc.).
• In connection with selling, renting, leasing, disclosing or otherwise sharing of your personal information with third parties for those third parties' marketing or other purposes.
• To respond to a domestic or foreign legal process (e.g., a governmental or non-governmental subpoena).
• To make secondary uses (e.g., collecting information for one reason but using it for another when such use appears useful or convenient to us).
• To include you in relevant lists (like club or customer lists, newsletters, blogs, feeds, alerts or other communications).
• To deal with social networks . We and you will be subject to their applicable policies and rules, some of which may allow you to restrict some disclosures.
• To work with advertisers to place ads in our Channels, which may include "behavioral," "targeted," "cross site" and other types of advertising intended to be personalized to you or your device.
• For other purposes that are not in this privacy policy but that are provided or otherwise indicated in connection with a particular collection.
It is not possible for us to list every lawful disclosure we might make of PI and we'll change as technology, society, law and our business change, so the above contains general, non-exclusive illustrations. We reserve the right to supplement or change the examples from time to time and to make all lawful uses of PI worldwide.
Affiliates. We may share information between Zumiez Canada Holdings Inc. and Zumiez Inc., and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, as necessary for the proper management of the Zumiez business.  This may include sharing PI for direct marketing, market research and analysis, to develop and advertise promotions, to provide customer service, to fulfill orders and other requests, and for administrative purposes.
Business Transactions. We may disclose PI to third parties in connection with a proposed or actual business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, reorganization, sale of all or part of our stock or assets, spinoff, bankruptcy, dissolution or anything else.  Our successors and assigns may use your PI for the purposes described in this privacy policy.
Service Providers. PI may be transferred to, or collected by, service providers (including affiliates acting in this capacity) for a variety of purposes such as credit card processing, shipping, authentication, email distribution, loyalty program management, market research, promotions management, call centre, information technology and data hosting or processing services.  Some of these affiliates and service providers may be located outside of Canada, including in the United States, and your personal information may be collected, used, disclosed, stored and processed outside of Canada for the purposes described in this privacy policy. We take reasonable contractual or other measures to protect your personal information while processed or handled by these service providers.  While your personal information is located outside Canada it will be subject to legal requirements in those foreign countries applicable to us, our affiliates and service providers, for example, lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities in certain circumstances.
Analytics Providers. An example is Google Analytics whose tracking cookies collect traffic data (e.g., data about where Site visitors come from, what they do, where they go, etc.). You may read Google's privacy policy at //www.google.com/policies/privacy/ . It includes Google's instructions on how to block some cookies associated with Google services.
Advertising Networks. We may use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties to, for example, serve advertisements on our Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on our Sites. Some of these third party service providers participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool (//www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavior Advertising (//www.aboutads.info/choices/) . You can learn more about these tools by clicking on the referenced links. Please note the following with respect to opting out:
• The opt-out tools discussed above are "cookie based." This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices. If you delete tracking technologies using the controls in your Web browser after opting out, you may have to opt out again to re-establish your opt-out preferences.
• Opt-outs are "browser-specific." The opt-out preferences that you choose will apply only to the Web browser that you used when you selected these preferences. This means, for example, that if you opt-out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the use of information collected by tracking technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device. It also means that opting-out on one device will not affect the use of information by tracking technologies on other devices that you may use to access out Site.
Other. We may disclose PI as necessary to exercise, enforce or preserve our rights, to meet legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and insurance requirements, for security, fraud prevention, authentication and verification purposes, and to respond to a domestic or foreign legal processes (e.g., a governmental or non-governmental subpoena or a warrant or production order).  We may also disclose PI for other purposes with your consent or as permitted or required by law, including foreign laws applicable to us, our affiliates and service providers.
The file containing your PI will be maintained on our servers (or those of our affiliates or service providers) and will be accessible to our authorized employees, representatives and agents who require access in connection with their job responsibilities.  We use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your PI from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We use what we believe are commercially reasonable security measures to protect your PI that we possess or control. You also have a role in security, for example you are in charge of the security of any applicable password for a Channel and you control the access device you use (some of which devices can be insecure). An unfortunate reality of our digital age is that security measures are seldom infallible, accidents happen and individuals (including, but not limited to, employees, or service providers) might fail to follow policies or contracts. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION; WE PROVIDE THE SECURITY AS IS; AND WE DISCLAIM ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty on us, you agree that the standard used to measure our compliance shall be intentional misconduct.
Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers' personal information and financial account credentials. "Phishers" use 'spoofed' e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social insurance numbers. WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL INSURANCE NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such email communication, please forward it immediately to us at help@Zumiez.com with the subject of "Privacy", and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer or other device.
You can review, update, deactivate or delete some of PI related to your account with zumiez.com or thezumiezstash.com by: (1) going to the relevant Site, logging into your account and editing your profile; (2) calling Customer Care Toll Free at 1-877-828-6929 or (3) contacting us at our Privacy Policy Address below.
You can and should update your contact information so that we can communicate with you effectively, especially mobile phone numbers as this information is needed so that we can stop sending messages to your old number or address.
We may deny a request to alter or access data subject to applicable law and receipt of authenticating information where we believe it is appropriate to do so. You will not be able to change or delete all PI. For example, you will not be able to alter PI that:
• We already provided to someone else;
• You are not supposed to access, change or eliminate or that might jeopardize us or others if you altered it;
• Has already been combined with other information; or
• We need for business related purposes (for example, to prevent or respond to potential fraud or so that we can show that we or a service provider acted appropriately).
We will determine in our good faith discretion (subject to applicable law) what PI may be altered and how it may be altered. We may keep records of the original PI and changes to it (including deletions) and disclose it for lawful purposes.
When PI is eligible for "deletion" or "removal," you agree that, unless otherwise expressly required by law, we need not actually remove or eliminate it but may instead curtail access to it until it is gone (such as by being overwritten), or we may keep it but make it invisible to Channel visitors. Please note that even if we remove PI or eliminate or restrict access to it, others who already have the PI will still have it and we do not agree to try and get them to change or delete it. If a law requires us to try to do that, you agree that we may satisfy such a law by sending the third party notice to alter or delete it.
Zumiez Privacy Policy
If applicable law requires us to accept requests by other means, use the foregoing address to learn about those means. We will honor requests as required by law. We may do that by supplying a copy or access within a reasonable time, but no less time than needed to process or alter databases in the ordinary course of business.
Currently, we do not charge for responding to such requests, but reserve the right to do so.
You need particularly to consent to items that some laws want us to emphasize. You specifically consent to each of the following:
Behavioral, Targeted or Similar Advertising: Certain features and services on our Site are designed to make your online experience more efficient and enjoyable through the use of behavioral, targeted or similar advertising. By that we mean that we collect data about your activities with others or us over time for use in providing advertising about products and services tailored to what we or others think you might be of interest to you. This commonly happens on our Site and other websites, but it may also occur in our Apps — like our App for TheZumiezStash — (or others) and at physical stores or events. You expressly agree that we and other participants may disclose PI to do such advertising.
Precise Geo Location Data: This privacy policy discloses that we may obtain and disclose location data. We are referring to GPS technology (or the like) that helps determine your location such as when you are using our Site, an App (of ours or others) or are at a store or event. You agree that we may disclose and keep that data as allowed by this privacy policy. If you give consent to someone else (such as an App store) for us to use location information, you agree that we may rely on that consent in addition to this one.
Sensitive PI: This privacy policy explains that we and others (e.g., service providers) may make disclosures of PI that might be viewed by some regulators as sensitive PI. You expressly consent to that.
Data Transfers: This privacy policy explains that we and others will make disclosures and transfers of PI into and out of the United States and any other country worldwide. You expressly consent to that.
Cookies and Other Technologies: This privacy policy explains that cookies and/or other technologies may be stored on or access your computing devices. You consent to that, and, subject to this privacy policy and applicable laws, to disclosure of the PI or other information so gained by us or others.
Electronic Notice if There is a Security Breach: If we or any of our service providers are required to provide notice of unauthorized access to, use of, or other disclosure of PI about you, you agree that we (or they) may do so voluntarily or when required by posting notice in a relevant Channel, sending notice to an e-mail or other "e" address we have for you (or that you have authorized for other communications), or by any other method allow by law or contract in our (or their) sole discretion.
Consent to Recording. If you deal with us (or those who help us) over the phone or in a "live" meeting or the like that you access by computer, mobile phone or other access device, you agree that we may record the conversation and use and disclose it under this privacy policy. PI included in one medium (e.g., a telephone call) may be recorded or entered into other media (e.g., a computer record).
The above special consents are specifically highlighted in our privacy policy because we want to make you aware of them, and to let you know that, unless you withdraw your consent (as discussed more below in Your Opt-Out/In Options ), we consider your use of our Channels to be your consent to the above items. If you are not willing to provide and maintain theses consents, then do not use the Channels through which PI is collected, eliminate your accounts with us, and uninstall any of our Apps.
Options Offered By Us. You have the option to opt-in or opt-out to marketing emails and text messages. Many of the ways are straightforward. For example, if we ask you to participate in a survey and you participate we may ask that you provide PI. If you don't want to provide any PI then one option you have is to not participate in the survey. Similarly, if you use a social media network to share your favorite finds from Zumiez you may exchange PI with us. Once you provide PI or use such technologies such as a "like/dislike" button the data may be disclosed or used by us. Again, one option you have is to not utilize social media in this way if you have concerns about sharing your PI.
Even if you opt-out (or do not opt-in), you will still receive other communications from us such as transactional emails and messages related to your questions, orders, updates about products or services you purchased and information about your account. You will also continue to receive communications relating to particular things you signed up for such as for a contest or at an event.
Options Offered By Others; Third Parties on Our or Other Websites. Some browsers, devices, distribution platforms, or applications help you refuse to accept some technologies or allow you to create some privacy settings (for example, establishing a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal to third parties; or being able to say yes or no to the collection of certain data). These technologies may or may not be successful. For example in the case of browsers, not all technologies are controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser or device might be recognizable even if you disable a technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be honored; and even if a setting is honored for one purpose data still may be collected for another. Also, you can control tools on your mobile devices. For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. To modify the push notifications you get from our Apps, you can alter your preferences in your profile.
For all options, opting-out does not apply to PI that was disclosed before opting-out or to disclosures to which opting-out is not allowed by law, this privacy policy, a supplemental notice, our other terms and conditions or any other relevant arrangement we have with you (e.g., terms of a contest). If you opt-out and then do so something inconsistent with that opt-out (e.g., again use a Channel that collects the "opted-out" PI), we will assume you have changed your mind and may rely once again on all of your previous consents (subject to applicable law) or any new consents relating to your new actions.
As referenced earlier, we may use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties to, for example, serve advertisements on our Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on our Sites. Some of these third party service providers participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool ( //www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ ) and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavior Advertising ( //www.aboutads.info/choices/ ). You can learn more about these tools by clicking on the referenced links. Please note the following with respect to opting out:
• The opt-out tools discussed above are "cookie based." This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices. If you delete tracking technologies using the controls in your Web browser after opting out, you may have to opt out again to re-establish your opt-out preferences.
• Opt-outs are "browser-specific." The opt-out preferences that you choose will apply only to the Web browser that you used when you selected these preferences. This means, for example, that if you opt-out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the use of information collected by tracking technologies when you us Mozilla Firefox on the same Device. It also means that opting-out on one device will not affect the use of information by tracking technologies on other devices that you may use to access out Site.
Unless legally required, we do not commit to honoring "Do Not Track" signals in your browser because honoring it would prevent much of the tracking and disclosures described in this privacy policy. Even if we were to decide to honor such a signal, we would not make any commitment that our efforts would be successful. Getting a DNT signal actually to work as you might want can be very difficult for the kinds of reasons that we listed above in " Your Opt-Out/In Options ".
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed your personal information as defined under that statute, for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of that kind of personal information that was disclosed to them. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request you may contact us by writing us at:
Zumiez Privacy Policy
Zumiez Inc.
The Services are not directed to or intended for use by minors.  Consistent with the requirements of applicable law, if we learn that we have received any information directly from a minor without his or her parent’s verified consent, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) to inform the minor that he or she cannot use the Services and subsequently will delete that information
California Minors: While the Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: help@zumiez.com .  When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it.  We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the Content or information.  Removal of your content or information from the Service does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.
"Aggregate Data" means information that we reasonably believe has been "de-identified" or "anonymized" such that (a) it is not PI, (b) it was PI but no longer is, or (c) it reasonably would only be viewed as PI by use of special knowledge or resources that we and others ordinarily don't have in the ordinary course of their business.
"Common Uses" Another way to describe common uses of PI is to think of uses that should be apparent or relevant in context, i.e., given the circumstances, for what purposes might a business like Zumiez collect, use and otherwise disclose PI from time to time? For example, we make disclosures:
• To meet our obligations and enforce our rights, to make disclosures to third parties who help us (e.g., service providers, information technology providers, mailing and other business process providers, outsourcing providers and so on), and to operate and improve our business;
• For security, fraud prevention, authentication, verification purposes and so on, including (without limitation) searching public records or publicly available information (such as information on the Internet) and participating in industry or private initiatives (such as sharing data to help decrease fraud);
• To communicate with you, such as responding to questions or requests or contacting you for lawful purposes, including surveys;
• To vendors and their service providers needing data to do their jobs;
• To deal with an activity or a contract, or to obtain additional PI from you or others. For example:
⁃ If we collect payment card information we will disclose it to third parties throughout the processing system (e.g., banks, networks, card organizations etc.) and to protect ourselves or others, including to law enforcement; and
⁃ We might try to follow up with you such as to help determine who you are or your authority, including doing things like checking records of ours or others, keeping copies, and making disclosures in disputes like, lawsuits or investigations.
• To persons appearing to have a lawful interest in the PI (e.g., an insurance company dealing with a claim involving you);
• To comply with applicable law, including keeping records for as long as required or that we believe is advisable;
• For the kinds of purposes appearing in laws or regulations as exceptions to any privacy rights you may have or to your ability to "opt-out" of disclosures, even if those exceptions do not actually apply to us. An example is the Federal Trade Commission's regulation implementing privacy rules for financial institutions. It lists many typical reasons that those institutions may make disclosures or not offer an "opt-out" choice and you can see them at 16 C.F.R. § 313.14 and § 313.15;
• To exercise or preserve our legal rights, such as to attempt to protect or prevent harm (including economic harm) to us, our interests, property (of every nature, including intangible property rights) and business. Without undertaking any duty to do so, we may do the same for someone else such as any third party, including our affiliates or you; and
• To make additional disclosures that are consistent with the context or relationship of our transactions with you (or your principal) or that are required or allowed by law, regulation or other relevant guidance.
"Extraordinary Uses" We may disclose PI in out-of-the-ordinary circumstances or emergencies, subject to applicable law. There is no clear line between ordinary and extraordinary purposes, but here are some examples of what we view as more in the nature of extraordinary:
• We may disclose PI to third parties with whom we might explore or engage in an extraordinary transaction, such as (without limitation) mergers or acquisitions, reorganizations, sales of all or part of our stock or assets, spinoffs, bankruptcies, dissolutions or anything else. We reserve the right to continue to use and disclose for our own purposes, all PI that we had before we engaged in such a transaction until it is clear that there is no longer a business or legal reason to do so; and
• We might hold PI until you or a related person cure a violation of obligations to us (e.g., if you are involved in a breach of a contract relating to us).
"Legal Process" By "legal process" we mean things that we might have to do to comply with laws or what appears to be a law in the United States and other countries that that have or claim to have jurisdiction over us or information that we own, possess or control. Most countries have laws that allow governments or non-governments, including private persons in litigation, to use laws allowing them to obtain information. Examples include things like subpoenas (private, grand jury or other), warrants, identity theft requests, requests for information about an anonymous speaker, investigative demands (from law enforcement, regulators or others), national or international security letters or demands or the like, and so on. We may be required to comply and we reserve the right voluntarily to comply or cooperate with the requesting party, such as if we think that may help protect someone (including you, us or others) or some property (of ours, yours, or others). We also reserve the right to object to the legal process or to tell you about it so that you can object and obtain an appropriate order permitting us not to comply with the original request.
Sometimes the law will preclude us from telling you about the legal process. In other circumstances we might be allowed to tell you but it might not be practical or advisable to do so. We will determine in our sole discretion whether to contact you (e.g., we might contact you to so that you can object as noted above, or we might not make contact if there is concern that such might facilitate potential harm). You agree that we may do any or all of the above.
"Personal Information," "personal information" or "PI" means information we're required by law to protect and: (a) that personally identifies you, or (b) that does not personally identify you but reasonably may be used to identify you or your computer or other device that you use (e.g., mobile phone, tablet, automobile, "Google Glass" or other consumer or electronic product or device) and a law requires us to treat it as personally identifying you. PI does not include Aggregate Data or information that is publicly available, including in our Channels (e.g., if you include PI in a comment posted in a publicly accessible area of a Channel, that PI will become public information upon its posting and will cease to be PI).
"Third Party Services" We use third party systems and services for a variety of purposes. Many of those types of third parties are mentioned in other explanations in this privacy policy and do things like managing credit card processing, shipping, authentication, email distribution, market research and promotions management and many other things. The third parties may have their own terms & conditions and privacy policies that may apply to you and that can include their sharing of data with other third parties (e.g., members of an ad network). Laws and contracts can regulate some of that sharing depending upon data type, e.g., the third party who does our credit card processing is not free to share that data other than for processing. Here are some examples of Third Party Services that we use (although this may change from time to time):
• We use analytics providers. An example is Google Analytics whose tracking cookies collect traffic data (e.g., data about where Site visitors come from, what they do, where they go, etc.). According to the Google Analytics Terms of Service, Google does not want us to supply PI and we do not intend to do so. However, we do not make or control Google's technologies and information it already has or might obtain. Just in case data we send is or becomes PI, you should look at Google's privacy policy at //www.google.com/policies/privacy/ . It includes Google's instructions on how to block some cookies associated with Google services.
• We use service providers, for example, we currently use CrowdTwist to help us operate TheZumiezStash. To the extent relevant, specific terms and conditions and/or policies with respect to CrowdTwist’s privacy policy will be referenced in the terms of service for TheZumiezStash.
"Social Networks" We use social networks websites, applications and services in various Channels such as "social plug-ins," "widgets" or other technologies that do various things (e.g. allow you to log-in via social media credentials or to express your "likes/dislikes" or "pin" something). When we use or you interact with social network technologies, we will receive (and you will allow) disclosures contemplated by the social network's privacy policy or other rules, including the network's "developer rules" (which are rules allowing us to use the social technology). Here are a few examples of social networks we use and links to some of their policies or rules:

CrowdTwist, Inc. (CrowdTwist) owns and operates certain websites that implement fan clubs, incentive programs, reward programs and other loyalty programs (collectively, Program), each of which is accessed from a website that is affiliated with Zumiez, Inc. (collectively, Client) who is the focus of that Program. Each Program, together with the content, incentives and rewards, information sharing and other services available at that Program, are collectively referred to herein as the Service.
The following are the current terms and conditions for use of this Program and Service. Except certain aspects of the Service that may be available to Public Users, the Service is provided only to users who become Members (as such terms are defined below). The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein (Terms of Service). The Terms of Service shall be deemed to include all other operating rules, policies and procedures that are referred to herein or that may otherwise be published at the Program by CrowdTwist from time to time (collectively, Policies), including without limitation, Policies that may be published in respect of:
Privacy
Copyright
The Terms of Service are in addition to (not in lieu of) any other agreement (whether in writing or clickwrap) that you have entered into with CrowdTwist (now or in the future) regarding any Service (Other Agreements). If there is any conflict between the Terms of Service and those of any Other Agreement, the terms of the Other Agreement shall control.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE, OR IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE OR AUTHORIZED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING ALL OR ANY PART OF THE PROGRAM OR SERVICE WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE AND CREATE A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT UNDER WHICH YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF SERVICE, WITHOUT MODIFICATION.
CrowdTwist reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Service (including any Policy), in whole or in part, at any time. CrowdTwist will use reasonable efforts to notify Users of any material change at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of any change. Change notices may be communicated by postings in the Program or, in the case of Members, electronic mail. In any case, Users should periodically check the Terms of Service for changes. Continued use of the Service following such notice of any change to the Terms of Service constitutes User's acceptance of those changes. The Terms of Service may not otherwise be amended, except by a written agreement executed by User and CrowdTwist.
CrowdTwist may terminate the Service, in whole or in part, at any time.
You must be at least 13 years of age to visit the Program and use the Service. If you do not so qualify, you are prohibited from accessing, using and registering for the Service. CrowdTwist will not collect personally identifiable information from any person that is actually known to us to be a child under the age of 13.
The term Users includes all registered and unregistered users that access or use the Program or Service. Each User that properly completes the registration process shall be considered a Member for the purposes of the Terms of Service. Users that do not complete the registration process, or whose registration is not accepted, shall be considered Public Users. Public Users have limited access to the Service, if at all.
CrowdTwist may refuse to offer or continue offering the Service to any person or entity and may change its eligibility criteria from time to time.
To become a Member, each User must complete the registration process by providing CrowdTwist with current, complete and accurate information, as more specifically required by the then current registration procedures. By way of illustration and not limitation: prospective Members may be required to provide their name and postal code (or outside the US, city and country), username, password, legitimate electronic mail address and certain additional information (such as, for example, preferred contact method and products and services of interest); in order to obtain certain aspects of the Service, Members may also elect to provide access information related to their accounts at social networking sites (such as, for example, Twitter, Facebook, FourSquare and Instagram); and in order to obtain certain Services applicable to the Rewards Program (as further described below), Members may be required to provide mobile telephone account information. Members shall maintain and update their registration data from time to time, to ensure that it is always current, complete and accurate. Users may apply for registration at www.thezumiezstash.com . CrowdTwist may refuse to accept any User's application to register as a Member, in its sole discretion.
Upon acceptance, CrowdTwist will provide access credentials to the Member. Each Member is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its access credentials and other account information, and will be solely liable for any and all activities under its account. Member shall be responsible for keeping all account information up-to-date. Member agrees to notify CrowdTwist immediately of any unauthorized use of Member's account or any other breach of security.
At this time, a User must register to become a Member of each Program separately.
Client's current Privacy Policy is available at www.zumiez.com/help/policies-terms . CrowdTwist will not edit, delete or disclose the contents of a User's data in connection with the Service unless (a) reasonably necessary to perform the Service, (b) authorized by the User, (c) otherwise permitted under the Privacy Policy or (d) Client or CrowdTwist reasonably believes that such action is necessary to (i) conform or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of CrowdTwist, Client, or any User or (iii) enforce the Terms of Service or any Other Agreement.
CrowdTwist will use Member's social networking account information only as permitted under the Privacy Policy and for the purpose of providing the Service (as it concerns the applicable Client and Program) to Member, and will not otherwise attempt to obtain information from (or post information using) such accounts.
The Service may include one or more programs (the Rewards Program) where Members can accumulate and redeem loyalty rewards points (Points), on an individual basis and solely for their own account. The Rewards Program may be structured to offer certain benefits based on the Member's current balance of "redeemable" Points (that is, Points that have not previously been redeemed) or "lifetime" Points (that is, all prior Points accumulated by Member, whether previously redeemed or not).
From time to time, CrowdTwist may establish (at its sole discretion) loyalty criteria pursuant to which Member's may "earn" Points (such as, for example: by registering for this Service; by sharing User Content at the Program; by engaging in certain specified activities at the Client Site (as defined below), like visiting or watching videos at the Client Site; by engaging in certain specified activities related to social networks). Points may expire (and become non-redeemable) after a specified period of time as determined by CrowdTwist and Client in their sole discretion.
From time to time, CrowdTwist may offer benefits or privileges to Members in exchange for redemption of a specified number of Member's Points. The nature of those benefits or privileges, and the number of Points required to obtain such benefits or privileges, shall be established by the Client and/or CrowdTwist and are subject to change.
Member acknowledges and agrees that:
Points have no "real world" or cash value.
Points have no purpose or use except in exchange for benefits or privileges (if any) offered by CrowdTwist via the Service.
Redemption offers may be time-limited or available only in limited quantities.
Points may only be used at the Program to which they apply and, therefore, cannot be redeemed at or transferred to Member's account at any other Program.
Member's Points cannot be redeemed by, or sold or otherwise transferred to, any other Member of this Program.
Upon termination of Member's registration for any reason, all Points are lost  to the extent permitted by law, regardless of how they were acquired by Member.
CrowdTwist's ability to accurately credit Points to Member's account based on Member's activities at social networking sites may be restricted by the terms, conditions or functions of such sites.
Points are not valid unless earned in strict compliance with the requirements as established and intended by CrowdTwist, and Member shall not attempt to earn Points by any means (including without limitation, by using any script, bot or other automated means) that only simulates compliance with the applicable requirements.
CrowdTwist's good faith determination of the amount of Points available to any Member hereunder shall be final and binding.
Resellers of Client merchandise or customers who make bulk purchases are not eligible to earn Points or to participate in the Rewards Program. CrowdTwist and Client reserve the right to review account activity for purchase patterns that fall outside the intended use of the program. CrowdTwist and Client have sole discretion in the determination of whether an account holder or User’s purchase patterns meet the qualification for bulk purchasing or purchasing for the purpose of reselling. Points acquired in that account will be forfeited and the account may be suspended or terminated.
Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Terms of Service, CrowdTwist and each Member or other User is solely responsible for all of its costs and expenses related to the Service.
The Client determines whether (and how much) Users will be charged to access the Program and use the Service. In the case of any Program and Service that are initially made available without charge, Client may later decide to charge for accessing or using some or all of the features of the Program and Service. In the case of any Program or Service where a subscription or other fee is charged, the Client may later decide to change the price of that fee.
