IP Address and Clickstream Data
Our server may collect information about the computer or other device You use to access or use the Sites or the Services. This information may include the Internet address of the computer Yor other device You use when you access or use the Sites or the Services. Your computer’s Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer by Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) whenever You connect Your computer to the Internet. When You operate Your computer to request and receive webpages or other content from our Sites or Services, our servers may log Your IP Address. We may also log Your domain name, which is a textual identifier for Your computer that also may have been assigned by Your ISP. We use Your IP Address and domain name to help identify You and to gather demographic information about our customers as a whole. We may also record the referring webpage that linked You to us (e.g., of another website or a search engine); the webpages or other content You view on the Sites; the website or webpage You visit after the Sites; the ads You see on the Sites and/or click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings You are using when accessing and/or using the Sites or the Services; any search terms You have entered on the Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Sites and the Services. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may link this information with Your Personal Information.
Any or all of this information relating to accessing or usage of the Sites or the Services may be collected, compiled, maintained, processed, or otherwise used on our behalf by one or more service providers, including, for example, analytics vendor(s) and e-mail management partner(s).
Imported Information
You may choose to access the Sites or Services through a third-party website such as LinkedIn or similar sites or services. When You choose to do so, HealthcareSource will import some information from Your account on such other site or service and make the imported information part of Your Account and/or Profile.
Usage of Information
General Usage
We may use “cookies” and “web bugs” (described in more detail below) in the Sites, Services, or in our communications with You to enhance the functionality and features of the Sites and Services in general, to verify Your viewing and/or receipt of communications, to keep (and sometimes track) information about You, and to make Your transactions and other activities more convenient and efficient. We use cookies, for example, to remember user preferences or minimize the need for You to re-enter information.
Cookies
A “cookie” is a small data file that a website may send to Your browser and that Your browser may then store on Your computer or other device. Cookies may be used to track where You travel on the Sites and Services and what You look at and transact with. We may use cookies to deliver specific messages to You, for example, to announce a new feature that was added since the last time You visited a Site or used a Service. We may use session cookies, for example, to simulate a continuous connection, as cookies help us “remember” information about Your preferences and passwords and allow You to move within the Site without reintroducing Yourself. A cookie may enable us to relate Your use of the Site to other information about You, including Your Personal Information.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting the preferences in Your web browser. Please know, if You refuse or delete cookies (or configure Your web browser to refuse or delete cookies), there may be some features of the Sites or Services that will not be available to You and some webpages, areas of the Sites, Services, or features may not display or function properly.
Web Bugs
We may use web bugs (aka “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies in the Sites, Services, and/or in communications with You to enable us to evaluate Site and Services usage information about users, upgrade user information, and know whether You have visited a webpage or received a message. A “web bug” is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a webpage or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a webpage or e-mail message. A web bug may enable us to relate Your viewing or receipt of a webpage or other message to other information about You, including Your Personal Information.
Use of Data and Personal Information
We will use the Data we collect or that You provide to use for various purposes, including, for example, to respond to Your requests, to foster a positive user experience, to provide You with the Services and features offered on or through the Sites and Services, and to operate and improve our Sites and Services.
By visiting the Site(s) or using the Service(s), including by creating an Account or Profile, by publicly posting information, or by opting in when presented with certain choices, You have consented for HealthcareSource to use Your Data, including Personal Information, in the following ways:

to allow You to export Your Data to other Sites or Services;
to allow You to export Your Data to sites or services of third parties;
to match Data collected from You through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Site or Service usage information, and use such Data along with data obtained from other sources, including third parties;

to make suggestions to You and draw inferences about You;
to customize advertisements and other content displayed to You on the Site or through the Services, including sending You new job postings or related Services, based on Your Data;
to analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, the Sites and Services both on an individual basis and in the aggregate;
to correspond with You, about products, services, companies, job opportunities, training curriculum, and events, sponsored by us and/or others, that we think might interest You; provided that You may opt-out of receiving such correspondence from us by following the instructions in the Opt In and Opt Out Rights section above;
to provide our customers with benchmarks about the characteristics and trends of the talent management market, including availability, behavior, experience, and performance of talent;
to give search engines access to publicly posted information; and
to detect, investigate, and prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal.
As mentioned, we may provide You an opportunity to receive offers from other entities that have services, products, and offers that we think might be of interest to You. We do not and cannot control information collected by these entities; the collection and use of that information is subject to any applicable privacy policies of those entities. Further, we will not transfer Your contact information to any unaffiliated third party for the third party’s marketing purposes unless You expressly authorize us to do so.

Upon written request, we will send You a copy of the Personal Information we have on file in Your user account (if any). You may send us new or updated Personal Information at any time. We will respond to Your request to access, update or delete Your information as soon as practicable.

Please be aware that HealthcareSource is a data processor of certain information, which may include Your Data or Personal Information, for our customers.

Access to, or correction, update, or deletion of Your Data may be denied or limited by HealthcareSource if it would violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise prohibited by applicable law.
Security
HealthcareSource will take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of Your Personal Information from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction, including making sensitive information available to our employees and agents on a need-to-know basis. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be free or absolutely safe from unauthorized access or intrusion by others, such as hackers. By using the Sites or Services, You acknowledge that You understand and agree to assume these risks.
If You contact us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on the Sites or Services, You should be aware that Your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information You send by these methods in transit.
If You become a customer or otherwise purchase our Services, You may be able to create an account on the Sites or in the Services with a username and password. HealthcareSource policies preclude access to passwords by anyone at HealthcareSource or its service providers except on a need-to-know basis. If You do create a username and password, You are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of Your account password, and You shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Sites or Services by You or any person or entity using Your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of You, and whether or not such person or entity is Your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify HealthcareSource of any unauthorized use of Your password or account or any other breach of security, (b) take any reasonable steps within Your control to prevent any further unauthorized use or breach, (c) ensure that You exit from Your account at the end of each session, and (d) ensure that any individual leaving Your organization no longer maintains any access to Your account. It is Your sole responsibility to protect Your password, control access to and use of Your account.
We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from Your failure to comply with this provision. We will have no liability for disclosure of Your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of Your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify You of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and will do so using the contact information You have provided to us and that we have stored for You as Your Personal Information. It is Your responsibility to ensure Your contact information remains up-to-date. To the extent that the contact information we have for You includes an e-mail address, we may notify You by e-mail of any potential compromise of Your Personal Information. By visiting the Sites and using the Services, You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
Phishing
Please know that it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which such an e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the website requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company, while in reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity is known as “phishing.”
Please know that we will never ask You to provide us with Your password for any reason, and will not ask You to provide any sensitive information (including Personal Information) via e-mail. If You receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that You provide any sensitive information (including Your password) via e-mail or to a Website that does not seem to be affiliated with HealthcareSource, or that otherwise seems suspicious to You, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at solutions@healthcaresource.com .
Consent to Worldwide Transfer and Processing of Personal Data
When You give Your Personal Information to HealthcareSource, it may be processed by HealthcareSource in the United States and all other countries in which HealthcareSource operates or in which our affiliates operate. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for Your personally identifiable information. Regardless of the laws in place in these countries, HealthcareSource will treat the privacy of Your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with the laws of the United States and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. By providing Your personally identifiable information to HealthcareSource, You fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer or transmission of Your information to, and processing of Your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
