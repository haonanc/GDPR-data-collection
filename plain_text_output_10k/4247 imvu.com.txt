Cookies (and Related Technologies)
Technical, analytics, and usage information
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. When you visit or access the Services, we may by means of cookies, beacons, tags, scripts, and/or similar technologies automatically collect technical information about the devices and software you use to access the Services, such as the type of Internet browser or mobile device you use, the website or source that linked or referred you to the Services, your IP address or device ID (or other persistent identifier that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device on the Internet), the operating system of your computer or mobile device, and other similar technical information. 
We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. IMVU tracks users use of the Services, but does not track users across third party websites. 
These same technologies (or a combination of them) may also be used to help us:
Capture and store users' preferences, account settings, and certain login information (mainly for convenience, user verification, and account security)
Compile statistics and analytics about your use of and interaction with the Services, including details about how and where our Services are accessed, how often you visit or use the Services, the date and time of your visits, your actions on the Services, and information regarding in-game activities, and other similar traffic, usage, and trend data. These analytic tools allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your device and gain insights about how mobile software is used in order to improve your experience;
Gather important functionality, testing, and performance data about our Services, including performance data related to our mobile application, such as networking activity, CPU load, and resource usage, among other relevant data.
Moderate user behavior on the Services, such as protecting against payment fraud and other inappropriate activities;
Gather demographic information about our user base; and,
Perform other similar functions.
We may use third party tools and technologies to help us gather this information discussed above. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data with technologies such as tracking pixels.
Google provides some additional privacy options described at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ with respect to Google Analytics cookies. To opt out from Google Analytics, you can download a plug-in from http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Typically, all technical, analytics, and usage information is gathered by IMVU in anonymous form and does not identify you personally.

As further described below, IMVU partners with third-party advertisers, ad server companies, and ad networks (collectively, "External Partners") that use cookies, beacons, tags, tracking pixels and scripts and other tracking technologies in order to collect data such as IP address, device ID, and other information about your computer or device, as well as Internet and online usage information and information about certain activities on the Services, including purchases and in-game information.
What does this mean? When you click on a link to an External Partners on our Site, that External Partner will drop a cookie (or similar tracking technologies) and likely capture and collect your device ID or IP address, so that it can track your activity on the Site and when you visit other sites, unless you have not opted in or have blocked cookies as described below.

* ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR OUR USERS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA*
Notice Regarding Data Transfers outside of the United States of America
The information you enter on the Services or otherwise provide to IMVU may be transferred outside of your country to the United States of America and other jurisdictions which does not offer an equivalent level of protection as in other parts of the world (i.e., as in the European Union). In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country in certain situations. By agreeing to the terms of use and this Privacy Notice, you agree to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries, particularly the European Union, and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Notice. In our discretion, we may adopt other means, such as entering into Model Contract Clauses, or enter into different certification programs under applicable law for ensuring adequate safeguards.
Categories of Recipients of Personal Data
The categories of recipients of personal data with whom we may share your personal data are listed in "Information We Share" above.
Note that with respect to certain data processing activities for which your consent was obtained, if you withdraw your consent with respect to those processing activities, we will no longer share your information with third-party recipients, and request that such recipients cease processing your data.
Data Retention Periods
General Retention Periods
Subject to exceptions as required or permitted by applicable law, we retain personal data that is necessary for your use of the Services as long as you are a user of the Services. With regard to Creators, we retain financial information, Tax IDs and related information for as long as required by law.
Meta data on the Services which is needed for the purposes of IT security and maintaining the Services in general, can be retained for the prevention of abuse of minors, and therefore will be retained for such purpose for a period of up to three years. This includes (for instance) IP address and MAC Address.
For inactive users (i.e., users who have signed up but are not actively using the Services), we will delete personal data after 18 months of inactivity. If the user then wants to sign up again, he or she may choose to do so.
Any data collected with valid user consent will be retained until it is withdrawn or if we are not able to refresh it. 
Exceptions
There are exceptions from static retention periods that have to be taken into consideration. For instance, we cannot delete personal data when there are legal obligations to retain the data (e.g. arising from tax or commercial law). This is particularly true of data regarding financial transactions (e.g. in-service/app purchases; funds for Creators) and payment information.
Additionally, we cannot delete data when it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims ("litigation hold"). In this case, the data can be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims. 
The time frame of deletion
If personal data can no longer be retained it will be erased without undue delay, generally within one month, unless exceptions apply.
Anonymization
In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your personal data instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance. When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.
Purpose of the Processing and Legal Bases
IMVU uses your personal information for a number of different purposes. Some are essential for us to provide the Services you use or to fulfill our legal obligations, some help us run the Services efficiently and effectively and some enable us to provide you with more relevant and personalized offers and information. We use your personal information to provide our Services, for example to set up and run your account, process orders and transactions, respond to queries and comments, and provide you with the best possible level of customer service
In all cases we must have a reason and a legal ground for processing your personal information. Some of the most common legal grounds we rely on are briefly explained below.
Legitimate Interests.
We may process personal data for our own legitimate business interests. This relates to our ability to provide and maintain Services that work well and to give you the best Services, while making sure that you have the most secure experience. When we rely on this legal basis, we'll carry out a legitimate interest assessment to ensure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business interests don't automatically override your interests - we won't use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you.
If you establish a user profile, we will process your data in order to provide you a profile page on the Services, and enable you to have the best user experience. We may also process your information to allow you to move from one device to another, without it impacting your status, or to purchase virtual items on the Services. We may also process your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our Services, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure. We also have an interest in making sure our marketing is relevant for you, so we may process your information to send you marketing that's tailored to your interests.
If you have any concerns about the processing, you have the right to object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more information on your rights, please see "Staying in Control of Your Information: Your Rights" below.
Contractual.
We may process your personal data for the purposes of a contract to which you are a party, in other words your ability to use the Services. For instance, if you establish a user profile, we will process your data in order to provide you a profile page. Likewise, if you purchase virtual items on the Services, we will process your data in order to carry out the payment transaction. 
You have the right to request that IMVU amend your data, and you can ask for your data to be removed if you decide that you no longer want to use the Services. If we don't have any legal requirements to keep this, then we will remove it.
Consent.
IMVU may use consent where we're asking you to confirm your marketing preferences to ensure we only contact you via the medium you have chosen i.e. text or email. You may also be asked to give your consent when you're entering any sort of competition.
When we rely on consent, you'll be asked to confirm that you're happy to provide your personal data and that you give your permission to IMVU to process your personal data. All of the details such as why IMVU want your data, how it will be used and if your data will be shared will be provided at the time of asking you for your consent. Where we are relying on consent you will usually see a tick
You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time if you no longer want to be part of the IMVU processing activity where your consent was sought.
Legal Obligation.
IMVU will on occasion be under a legal obligation to obtain and disclose your personal data. Where possible, we will notify you when processing your data due to a legal obligation, however this may not always be possible. For instance, IMVU may need to provide your data in order to prevent criminal activity or help to detect criminal activity, in which case we may share information with law enforcement. This is done in a safe and secure manner. It's essential that IMVU complies with its legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, so if you object to this processing, IMVU will not be able to provide its Services to you.

Your right to move your data (portability)
Under certain circumstances you can request that a data collector move your data to another service provider. This is not an automatic right, and because IMVU provides unique Services, it may not be able to honor your right to data portability.
Your right to object to processing
You have to right to request that IMVU stop certain data processing activities that involve processing your personal data. This isn't an automatic right, and IMVU's ability to restrict processing will depend on the type of data that for which you are making this request. 
You have a right request deletion
You have a right to request that IMVU delete your personal data that it holds. This isn't an automatic right, and what IMVU is able to delete will depend on the type of data that IMVU holds about you, whether it was obtained via consent, what purpose it serves, and whether IMVU has an obligation to keep the data, among other things.
Note that unless you request deletion, and such request is determined to be appropriate, while you remain a user, we'll process and retain your data as described in this Privacy Notice in order to enable you to use the Services. Once you stop being a user, we will hold your data as described in the data retention section.
For all requests mentioned above, there is a 30 day limit to which IMVU must respond by, that may be extended in certain situations. Also, you will need to give adequate proof of your identity in order for IMVU to identify you before any data is released.
