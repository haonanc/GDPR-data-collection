The Site is operated by Availity, LLC (“Availity”). By using our Site, including on behalf of the organization for which you are accessing the Site (the “Organization”), you are agreeing for yourself and your Organization to the terms of this Privacy Policy (and to the Site’s Terms of Use ) which is incorporated by reference. Use of the term “you” herein shall mean you, the Organization or any users you authorize on the Site. Use of the term “us” or “we” herein shall mean the employees, agents or assigns of Availity L.L.C. Please review both of these documents before you use the Site to be sure you agree with them and our information collection and use practices.
Type of Information Collected and When It May Be Collected
Your Information. As you use the Site, we may gather information from you, including information by which you may be identified (“Personally Identifiable Information”). We may gather information from you if you voluntarily provide it through the Site, such as if you sign up to use Site services, including using an Organization-assigned user id, and if you e-mail us with information. Personally Identifiable Information we gather in these ways may include your name, Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or Social Security Number (SSN), e-mail address, address, telephone number, place of work, for example. We may also gather information from you and your use of the Site through use of Cookies, such as the nature of your use of the Site, your email address, your password, and information about your computer. Cookies are forms of technology through which a computer or server stores information, including on your computer or server, about you or your computer when you visit the Site. The Cookies enable the system to recognize the person or their computer when they return to the Site. You may be able to set your browser to disable some or all Cookies or to notify you when a Cookie is set.
Personal Health Information. A key function of the Site is to provide a technical communication system through which health care providers (through users acting on their behalf) may send and receive queries and information about their patients and potential patients to and from insurance companies, laboratories, pharmacies, and similar recipients and sources. The information exchanged includes personal health information by which individuals and patients may be identified (“Personal Health Information”). In providing this system, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, Availity does not consider its action of handling, transmitting, and/or ferrying of requests, information and responses as Availity’s use or disclosure of such information, as Availity in such capacity is merely providing a service to its users and is serving as the carrier of the information. However, all such communications and Personal Health Information exchanged through the Site may be stored by us (or our service providers for us) only as required by Law. By using this Site to send or receive any such Personal Health Information, you are acknowledging and confirming that you have secured any necessary permission to do so.

We Hold Ourselves Accountable to Our Privacy Principles
We established a Regulatory and Compliance Committee to ensure that the corporate culture of high ethics is continually emphasized.

We also conduct internal and external assessments of our operational security and privacy practices.
We provide all Availity employees with training programs designed to educate our employees about the meaning and requirements of our privacy practices and procedures. Employees who violate these commitments are subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Employees are expected to report any violations to their manager or to the Availity Privacy Officer.
We Extend These Privacy Principles to Our Healthcare Partners
We require companies we select as our healthcare partners to agree to keep patient medical information confidential and secure.
Our healthcare partners must also protect patient medical information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure by the healthcare partner, and limit its use to the purposes for which it was accessed.
