SurfEasy
Product/Service Description
SurfEasy provides private and security data transmission by routing browser Internet traffic through the SurfEasy network, which may mean your Internet traffic is routed through one or more countries. The software browser or client establishes and maintains an encrypted tunnel between the browser or device and the SurfEasy network. SurfEasy is a No Log network, which means that SurfEasy does not store originating IP address when connected to the SurfEasy service, and therefore SurfEasy cannot identify users when provided IP addresses of the servers. Because this information is not stored, this also means SurfEasy cannot disclose information about the applications, services or websites visited or used while connected to SurfEasy.
Data Access and Collection

Temporary usage data
