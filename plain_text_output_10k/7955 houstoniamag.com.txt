Information sharing and disclosure
HoustoniaMag.com will only share or disclose users’ personal information with companies other than HoustoniaMag.com when it is required by law; when disclosure is necessary to operate the website or certain website services; to protect the safety of our users, employees, or property; and/or when disclosure is consistent with HoustoniaMag.com’s practices for services that are similarly provided offline.
