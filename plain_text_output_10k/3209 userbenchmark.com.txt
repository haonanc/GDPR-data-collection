Consent

If you choose to make your personal information public through our services, for example, through your choice of username or other account profile information, we determine that you have given us your consent to store and display such information. You can withdraw your consent by changing your username or by deleting your account.

If you choose to complete a survey on or through our Services, we determine that you have given us your consent to process your data in line with this policy and the stated purpose of the survey. You can withdraw your consent by writing to UL.BenchmarkPrivacy@ul.com .
Contract
In certain circumstances, we will need your personal data in order to deliver our Services to you or to respond to a request that you ask of us.
We use Contract as the lawful basis for processing your personal data when you create a user account for our Services, when you request a quote, when you buy software or services from us, when you request customer support, or when you otherwise contact us with a request that requires a response.
Legal obligation
We may need to collect and use your data to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims. For example, tax laws require us to retain records of your purchases made through our Services.
Legitimate interests
This is a term in data protection law that means we have a good and fair reason to use your data in ways which do not hurt your interests, freedom, or rights.
We may use your personal information including your identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse, to keep our Services secure, or to protect the rights, property or safety of UL, our employees, our users or the public.
We use aggregated, anonymous data to analyze how users interact with our Services so that we can understand which elements are working well and which are not. This allows us to develop and improve the quality of our Services for all our users.
Your rights
Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, have certain rights regarding their personal information. Except where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information. While these rights are not required by law globally, all users of this this website and our software can manage their personal information as described below.
We may ask you to verify your identity before we act on your request. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to protect the information in our Services from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, when you delete information from our Services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers, and we may not remove information from our backup systems.
