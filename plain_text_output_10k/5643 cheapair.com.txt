We respect your privacy.
Although in the course of transacting business with you it sometimes becomes necessary to collect and store personal information, we do so only with your consent and we use this information only to enhance our relationship with you.
Booking travel with us is private, safe, and secure.
The Personal Information That We Gather

If you elect to make a purchase by credit card through our secure channels, we will also ask you for your credit or debit card number and expiration date.
Optionally, you can also choose to provide us with your membership numbers for frequent flyer or other loyalty programs.
How This Information is Used
When you register with us or make travel arrangements, we will sometimes share that information with third party vendors as is necessary to successfully complete your purchase-- including the vendors you have selected (e.g. airlines, hotels, etc.) and others who facilitate the transaction (e.g. credit card authorization companies.)
We also use your information, with your permission, to occasionally alert you to information and special promotions that we believe will be valuable to you, including e-mails promoting special travel deals. You can unsubscribe to these e-mails at any time by visiting the "My Profile" section of our site.
We do use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website.

To further safeguard your most sensitive credit card information, we transfer such information across the Internet in an encrypted format and then store such information in our secure database.
