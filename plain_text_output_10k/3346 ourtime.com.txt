We also may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.
Third-party websites
There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.
Public Availability of User Profile Information
Unless you elect to opt out, we may link or make available your dating site profiles to Internet search engines so that your profiles may be presented in Internet search results. You acknowledge and agree that the presence of your profiles in Internet search results may allow the general public to view some or all of the information that you elect to include in your profiles.  If you do not wish for the information in your profiles to be made available to Internet search engines or presented in Internet search results, please opt out as indicated in the next section.
You have the opportunity to opt out at any time of allowing us to make your profile available to Internet search engines.  You can accomplish this through your Account Profile. Simply click on "My Account" after signing in, click the "Edit" button under "Preferences" and follow the directions for opting-out of allowing access to your profile to search engines. To the extent that you have allowed your profile to be made available to Internet search engines at any time, you acknowledge and agree that your profile information may be stored or cached on third party servers, and we have no ability to cause or require such third parties to delete such information.
How you can access your information  
If you have an online account with us, you have the ability to review and update your personal information online by logging in and clicking on your "My Account".
If you have an online account with us, you may close your account at any time by visiting the "My Account" page for your account. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information.  However, you can open a new, separate account at any time.  If you close your account, we may still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our websites or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.
Your choices about collection and use of your information
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information     Qmay be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question;     or initiate other transactions on our website.
At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails from us by visiting the "My Account" page associated with your account.     Simply click on Edit Alerts under "My Account" and follow the directions for opting-out of the identified marketing programs.   You also will be given the opportunity,     in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request.     We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without     offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional     email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party     (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.
You may tell us not to share your personal information with third parties or the IAC family of companies for direct marketing purposes by visiting the     "My Account" page associated with your account after you have registered.
You can also control information collected by cookies.  See " Cookies " below for information about declining or deleting cookies.
How we protect your personal information
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
Information you provide about yourself while using our service
We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use . In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
Children's privacy
Although our website is a general audience site, we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

If you are visiting our websites from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
No Rights of Third Parties
This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.

Cookies:  
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our website. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies on our website do not link to or store your personal information.
For example, when you sign in to our website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you indicated that you would like your password saved for automatic sign-in. For security purposes, we will encrypt any usernames, passwords, and other user or member account-related data that we store in such cookies. In the case of sites and services that do not use a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may allow our authorized service providers to serve cookies from our website to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising.
You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. (Click "Help" in the toolbar of most browsers for instructions.) If you do so, some of the features and services of our website may not function properly.
We may allow third-parties, including IAC companies, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Our website does not provide any personal information to these third parties, but they may collect information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw and/or clicked on the advertisements they deliver (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, etc.), and possibly associate this information with your subsequent visits to the advertised websites. They also may combine this information with personal information they collect from you to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.  The collection and use of that information is subject to the third-party's privacy policy. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness.  Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies and provides information about this behavioral advertising practice ( www.networkadvertising.org ). This policy covers the use of cookies by People Media only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
Opting-Out of Advertising Cookies You may opt out of our data collection for use by third party ad companies to provide targeted People Media advertising to you when you visit other sites. Cookies are unique to each computer.  Therefore, you must opt out separately on all computers you use.  If you delete all of your cookies (specifically, the "Out-Out" cookie), you will have to go through the opt-out process again to reactivate your opted-out status.
You can opt out receiving of such advertising-related cookies by clicking below:
Web Beacons:
Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.
Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.  Third parties may use anonymous information about your visits to our site and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
