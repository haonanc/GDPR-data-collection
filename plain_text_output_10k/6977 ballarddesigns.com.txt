We want you to feel confident using our online Services to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at www.consumer.ftc.gov for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

We may provide areas on our online Services where you can post reviews of products. Such postings are governed by our Conditions of Use .
