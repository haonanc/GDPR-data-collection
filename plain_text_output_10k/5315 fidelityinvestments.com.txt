Fidelity Investments and the Fidelity Funds are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information about our current and prospective customers.
Please note that certain details of this policy may depend on whether you deal with us through an investment professional, directly as an individual investor, or whether Fidelity provides services to your employer or plan sponsor.
   
How and why we obtain personal information
Fidelity takes great care to protect personal information about you and when we use it, we do so with respect for your privacy. We may use personal information about you to service, maintain, and protect your account; process transactions in your account; respond to inquiries from you or your representative; develop, offer, and deliver products and services; or to fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. Fidelity may collect public and non-public personal information about you from any of the following sources:
You or your representative on applications or forms (for example, name, address, Social Security number, birth date, assets and income)
You or your employer or plan sponsor if Fidelity provides them with recordkeeping services (for example, payroll, human resources, or benefits information)
Transactional activity in your account (for example, trading history and balances)
Other interactions with Fidelity (for example, discussions with our customer service staff, information you enter into our websites, or when you enroll in our authentication services)
Information from consumer reporting agencies (for example, to assess your creditworthiness for margin products)
Information from other third-party data services (for example, to verify your identity and to better understand your product and service needs)
You or your representative regarding your preferences (for example, your choice of electronic statement delivery, or the screen layout you specify if you use our Internet sites)
 
How we protect information about you
Fidelity considers the protection of personal information to be a foundation of customer trust and a sound business practice. We employ physical, electronic and procedural controls and we regularly adapt these controls to respond to changing requirements and advances in technology.
 
How we share information about you with third parties
Fidelity does not share personal information about our customers with unaffiliated third parties for use in marketing their products and services. We may share personal information with the following entities:
Unaffiliated service providers (for example, printing and mailing companies, securities clearinghouses, marketing service providers, and other entities who may provide services at Fidelity's direction)
Government agencies, other regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials (for example, for tax purposes or for reporting suspicious transactions)
Other third parties, with your consent or as directed by your representative (for example, if you use Fidelity as a financial reference in applying for credit with another institution or if you use an external aggregation website or service that you have provided permission to access your Fidelity financial account on your behalf)
Other organizations as permitted or required by law (for example, for fraud prevention or to respond to a subpoena)
Our service providers are obligated to keep the personal information we share with them confidential and use it only to provide services specified by Fidelity. 
Based on the nature of your relationship with Fidelity, we may exchange information with other third parties as described below:
If Fidelity provides workplace services to your employer or plan sponsor, such as payroll, human resources or benefits recordkeeping services, Fidelity may exchange any information received in connection with such services with your employer or plan sponsor or others they may authorize.
If you conduct business with Fidelity through your investment professional, we may exchange information we collect with your investment professional or with others they may authorize.
 
We may share personal information about you with various Fidelity corporate affiliates including internal service providers which perform, for example, printing, mailing, and data processing services.
Additionally, if you interact with Fidelity directly as an individual investor (including joint account holders) or if Fidelity provides services to your employer or plan sponsor, we may exchange certain information about you with Fidelity financial services affiliates, such as our brokerage and insurance companies, for their use in marketing products and services as allowed by law.
 
Your digital privacy
Privacy, security, and service in Fidelity's online operations are just as critical as in the rest of our business. We use firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among other controls, to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Fidelity accounts and systems from unauthorized access.
When you interact with us by using our websites, online services, or mobile applications that are owned and controlled by Fidelity Investments ("our digital offerings"), Fidelity manages personal information in accordance with all of the practices and safeguards described previously.
When you use our digital offerings, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as device type, browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our digital offerings. We use this information for a variety of purposes, such as maintaining the security of your session, facilitating site navigation, improving Fidelity website design and functionality, and personalizing your experience. Additionally, the following policies and practices apply when you are online.
Cookies and similar technologies
Fidelity and our third-party service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to support the operation of our digital offerings. Cookies are small amounts of data that a website or online service exchanges with a web browser or application on a visitor's device (e.g., computer, tablet, or mobile phone).

Advertising on Fidelity digital offerings
Fidelity advertises on its own digital offerings (including our mobile applications), and when we do, we may use information about your relationship with us, such as the types of accounts you have, to tailor advertisements and communications about Fidelity and third-party products and services that may be of interest to you.
We may also use third-party service providers to help us determine which Fidelity products and services may be of interest to you. These service providers may collect information about your activity on Fidelity digital offerings using cookies and other technologies to analyze, for example, pages visited, search engine referrals, browsing patterns, and responses to advertisements and promotions. Such service providers may only collect and use such information for purposes specified by Fidelity and not for their own purposes.
Advertising on non-Fidelity digital offerings
Fidelity also advertises our products and services on digital offerings not affiliated with Fidelity and we contract with third-party advertising companies to display these ads. These third-party advertising companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect technical and web navigational information, such as device type, browser type, Internet protocol address, and pages visited.
Fidelity and these third-party online advertising companies may use the data collected, along with other information we have about you and your Fidelity relationships, to serve relevant ads to you. The advertisements may be relevant to your interests, as determined by your activity on Fidelity and non-Fidelity websites. These are known as "interest-based advertisements."
You may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertisements from online advertising companies by clicking on the AdChoices icon (which appears on all Fidelity interest-based ads) and following the opt-out instructions.
