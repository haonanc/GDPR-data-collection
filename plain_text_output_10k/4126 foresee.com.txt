ForeSee Results, Inc. Privacy Statement Effective date: August 12, 2016
If you have taken a ForeSee® survey, we thank you. If not, we hope you will do so in the future. ForeSee’s clients use the data we collect to improve your experience as a customer or web browser, and we want your voice to be heard.
In many cases, our surveys are anonymous; however, some of our clients may ask you for some basic contact information. Whether you provide that type of personal information is entirely optional. But in all cases, the information you provide belongs to our client, and we will not sell or otherwise use your information for any other purpose. That promise is simple, but the details are complex—please review our full Privacy Statement below for those details.
This Privacy Statement describes how ForeSee Results, Inc. (“ForeSee”) collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) that it receives about the following types of individuals through certain websites, mobile websites, and mobile applications as outlined herein: (i) ForeSee’s own website visitors, (ii) ForeSee’s clients (“Clients”), and (iii) ForeSee’s Clients’ customers and website visitors.  ForeSee’s practices with respect to each of these categories of individuals is explained below.
ForeSee recognizes that the European Union (“EU”) has established strict protections regarding the handling of Personal Data, and ForeSee therefore has elected to adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Privacy Shield”) with respect to such Personal Data that it receives in the United States about individuals located in the EU. ForeSee also engages with its Clients in the EU Model Clauses for data processing.
For further background and information about Privacy Shield, and to see ForeSee’s representation on the Privacy Shield List, please refer to the Privacy Shield website at  www.privacyshield.gov .
If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that ForeSee’s Clients may transfer your Personal Data to ForeSee for processing in the United States.  By using our website, contracting with us to receive our products or services, or submitting any information to us through a customer satisfaction survey or otherwise, you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction that may not provide the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your home jurisdiction.
Personal Data Collection and Purposes of Use
ForeSee collects customer feedback on behalf of its Clients, including some of the biggest players in retail, banking, media, and government.  Feedback is solicited through surveys, which are presented either through an interactive invitation or via email or text message.  Most ForeSee surveys do not solicit Personal Data and, when they do, the information is always optional.  All ForeSee surveys are entirely voluntary.
ForeSee’s Clients’ Customers and Website Visitors
ForeSee collects data for our Clients through online and offline (in store and call center) customer satisfaction surveys. The data collected by ForeSee may include the following categories of Personal Data:  name, email addresses, mailing address, and phone number.  ForeSee may also collect the following categories of demographic information:  age, gender, income bracket, education level and race.  If ForeSee combines demographic or other information with Personal Data about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data.  Personal Data does not include aggregated anonymous information.
In some instances, a Client may also provide ForeSee data about its customers or website visitors, which may include information about your use of the Client’s website and your relationship or transactional history with the Client.  ForeSee and/or the Client may combine this information with the data you provided in a survey response in order to better understand your feedback.  Please refer to the Client’s posted privacy policy to determine what information the Client may provide ForeSee.
The data ForeSee collects belongs to our Clients, and ForeSee uses the data to compile reports on customer satisfaction for our Clients.  Aggregated anonymous information may be provided to third-parties including media outlets, and does not include any Personal Data.
ForeSee may email customer satisfaction surveys to Client customers or website visitors.  Because ForeSee is acting as the Client’s agent, if the customer or website visitor chooses to opt-out of future emails, the opt-out will be Client-specific, and does not apply to other emails sent by ForeSee.  Data collected in response to an email is handled in the same manner as other Client customer and website visitor data, as described in this Privacy Statement.
ForeSee will not request, access or otherwise track any location based information from a Client’s customer’s or visitor’s mobile device.  Please refer to the Client’s posted privacy policy to determine what information the Client may collect.
Most of the data we collect is anonymous, but some of our Clients may direct us to ask for your contact information, which is Personal Data. Wherever we obtain access to Personal Data about our Clients’ customers or website visitors, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore process such Personal Data strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them.  ForeSee’s Clients are the data controllers and data owners.  If you are a customer or website visitor with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client’s website to understand the privacy practices that apply to Personal Data that we may maintain about you on behalf of the Client.  Our Clients are encouraged to participate in privacy initiatives to protect the privacy and security of the data collected; however, since we do not have direct control over the policies or practices of our Clients, we cannot be responsible for their actions.  We recommend that you always review the privacy policies of the Client for which you have been presented a survey before you provide any Personal Data.
You have the right to access your Personal Data.  If you would like to access and review Personal Data that you provided to us, you can either contact our Client with any such requests, or make your request directly to us at Privacy@ForeSee.com .  We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with such responses and will respond to such requests within 30 days.
Surveys with Sweepstakes Incentives
In certain instances, ForeSee’s surveys include sweepstakes incentives. When a survey includes a sweepstakes incentive, entry in the sweepstakes is entirely optional. Survey responses may be submitted without entering the sweepstakes. Please refer to the specific sweepstakes rules for further detail. In all cases, any contact information collected by ForeSee, including but not limited to name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number, is only used to manage the sweepstakes, subject to the sweepstakes rules and the terms of the Client’s privacy policy.
ForeSee’s Clients
ForeSee provides a wide variety of services and solutions, including providing Clients with comprehensive consumer experience measurement analytics through customer satisfaction surveys and related tools.  In connection with providing the services and solutions, ForeSee may obtain information about individual Client employees, including Personal Data about the Client contact such as name and contact information.  ForeSee may use this information for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services to our Clients, to establish or maintain client and business relationships and manage Client accounts, and to provide customer feedback to our Clients as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.  In addition, if you are a current ForeSee Client, we may send you service-related emails as necessary, for example, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance.  Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.
We will occasionally send you information on ForeSee products or services we think may be of interest to you if you are a Client or choose to sign up for our newsletter.  If you do not want to receive this promotional information, you may opt-out from these types of communications by following the instructions included in each communication, or by contacting us at  Privacy@ForeSee.com .
When you download and use our mobile applications for Client portal access, ForeSee automatically collects information such as the type of device you use and operating system version. ForeSee uses mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile application. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and the source of the application download.
Our Clients may contact us if any of their Personal Data changes, if they wish to have inaccurate data deleted, or if they would like to access and correct Personal Data that we maintain about them. They may contact us by sending an email to  Privacy@ForeSee.com , or by using the information at the end of this Privacy Statement. We will respond to your request to access and/or correct your Personal Data within 30 days. You may also contact your assigned analyst to inquire about your stored Personal Data.
ForeSee’s Website Visitors
If you visit our website located at  www.foresee.com  and download information or choose to contact us, you may provide certain Personal Data about yourself, such as your name, email address, phone number and mailing address.  We use this information to respond to your inquiry and, if necessary, to correspond with you.
Disclosures of Personal Data
ForeSee does not sell any Personal Data gathered from individual survey respondents and does not share any Personal Data with third parties for their own marketing purposes. Personal Data collected by ForeSee is only disclosed to ForeSee’s Client or as directed by the Client in accordance with the contractual relationship, or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement.
ForeSee may disclose Personal Data to business partners and subcontractors, such as sweepstakes administrators, as necessary in connection with the performance of requested services or solutions, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. ForeSee may also disclose Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations, ForeSee will require the recipient of the Personal Data to protect the Personal Data in accordance with the relevant Privacy Shield principles, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the Personal Data is appropriately protected. ForeSee may also disclose Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where ForeSee believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request.
If you have provided Personal Data to us, and wish to limit our use and disclosure of that data, you can contact us at Privacy@ForeSee.com .
Data Retention
ForeSee retains all data, including the Personal Data we process on behalf of our Client, for as long as needed to provide services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
Cookies on our Site
Many websites use “cookies” to help personalize a website visitor’s online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on the hard drive of a computer by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
We use session level cookies on  www.foresee.com  to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session level cookie expires when you close your browser. We do not link any Personal Data you provide to cookies.
ForeSee and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies by changing the browser preferences. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the services or websites you visit.
Third Party Cookies
We allow our third party tracking utility company to use cookies throughout our website. Although we do not have technological control over cookies they place in your browser, they are contractually restricted in their use of such cookies to uses consistent with this Privacy Statement. Our tracking utility company uses session level cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to track how many pages a particular visitor has passed over.
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use cookies or similar technologies in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising  click here .
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our website visitors’ Personal Data. We do not link Personal Data you provide to clear gifs.
Cookies In Our Surveys
Some cookies related to ForeSee’s surveys are deployed by the Client, consistent with the Client’s website privacy policy. You should refer to the Client’s website privacy policy for additional information on their use of cookies.
Session level cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a session, when you close your browser. ForeSee’s survey mechanism places a session level cookie on respondents’ browser to track non-personal information such as: the number of pages a particular visitor has passed over; what page the visitor was viewing when the survey appeared; what language, browser and operating system a visitor is using; the referring website (i.e., Google); and any search terms that brought the visitor to the website. We use this data to ensure that a visitor has sufficiently browsed the site in order to adequately answer the survey, and to prevent an individual from getting a survey multiple times in a single session.
Persistent cookies are automatically deleted on a set expiration date. A persistent cookie will only be placed if ForeSee’s Client desires for this type of cookie to be utilized, and in compliance with the Client’s privacy policy. This persistent cookie will only be used to track that a particular respondent has been presented a survey invitation and has completed or declined the survey to help ensure that the individual does not receive the survey again within a reasonable amount of time. ForeSee does not collect any Personal Data with this persistent cookie, and does not track any visitor once they have left the given site.
Log Files
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We use this information to better understand your website experience, and to ensure that we are optimizing the functionality of our website and survey interfaces.
Children Under 13
In most cases, ForeSee’s customer satisfaction surveys and website are not designed or intended for use by children under 13, although the sites we survey may offer children’s products for purchase by adults and/or children’s services. If you are under 18, you should not participate in our survey or use our site without the permission and in the presence of a parent or guardian. In rare instances, a ForeSee Client may choose to survey children under 13; such surveys will not solicit Personal Data. Children under 13 may not submit any Personal Data to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered any Personal Data about a child under 13, we will take appropriate steps to delete it immediately. Children over 13 (ages 14-17) should only provide us with Personal Data if they have explicit permission from a parent or legal guardian.
Data Security and Integrity
ForeSee takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data stored in its global hosting centers and in other locations in the United States from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. ForeSee also makes reasonable efforts to keep all Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current, and complete. We use secure server hosting locations with 24×7 security monitoring, firewall protection, controlled access, and encryption technology to protect your Personal Data. When our Clients enter sensitive information (such as login credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Because no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
If you have any questions about our security practices, you can contact us via email at  Privacy@ForeSee.com  or by using the information at the end of this Privacy Statement.
