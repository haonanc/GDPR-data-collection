Credit Card Security Code
It is an important new Internet security feature that now appears on the back of most Visa and MasterCards, and on the front of American Express cards. This new code is a three or four-digit number which provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card. The security code helps validate that the customer placing the online order actually has the credit card in his/her possession, and that the credit/debit card account is legitimate. When you give your Card Security Code to a merchant, you assist the merchant in verifying that the order is being placed by you, the card holder. If this code is printed on your card, YES, you must enter the code. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express now require Internet stores to obtain the security code for all cards that have a code printed on them. In order for a transaction to be accepted and processed, you must enter this code if it's printed on your card. This is done for your protection.
