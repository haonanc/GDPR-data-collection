This Privacy Policy covers Transaction Wireless’ treatment of personal information that Transaction Wireless gathers when you are on any of our websites or otherwise use or access the Service.

This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Transaction Wireless does not own or control, or to individuals that Transaction Wireless does not employ or manage.
2. Information Collected.
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to personalize and improve the Service. We collect the following types of information from our users: email address, phone number, number of gift cards purchased or owned, number and date of visits, the device used to access and other Information you provide to us when using the Service.

3. Information We Automatically Collect.
We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Generally, the Service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our websites. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Service, so we can make the Service appealing to as many users as possible. In addition, we may provide statistical information (not information about you personally) to our partners about how our users, collectively, use the Service.
4. Information Collected by the Servers.
If you use our products to access the Servers, certain information processed by the Servers (such as, credit card numbers, credit card security numbers, etc.) will not be stored. Other information (such as, date/time stamp, authorization number, etc.) will be collected and stored, but only for statistical analysis purposes in order for us to improve the quality of the Service. Transaction Wireless treats all credit card data securely under the PCI DSS standards .  Any information collected by the Servers will not be shared with other third parties or used for any other reason. IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS THE SERVERS BY OTHER MEANS (I.E. WITHOUT USING OUR PRODUCTS), THEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS NOT APPLICABLE TO YOU.
5. Uses of Personal Information Collected.
The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as sending you information about our company or our features, products or services, or promotional materials from some of our partners, or to contact you when we deem it necessary. We also may use your personal information for editorial and feedback purposes, for marketing and promotional purposes, for a statistical analysis of users’ behavior, for product development, for content improvement, to inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their advertisements, and to customize content and layout of our websites.
