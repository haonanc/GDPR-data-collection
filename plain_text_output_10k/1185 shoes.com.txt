How we protect your personal information
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.  For example,                                 only                                 authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.  In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive                                 personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.  However, no system can be completely secure.  Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not                                 promise, and                                 you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal                                 information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.  Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that                                 information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.  For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages.  We cannot control who reads your                                 posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.  Once you have posted                                 information, you will not be able to edit or delete such information.
