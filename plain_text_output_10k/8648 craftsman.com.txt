Where to Buy and Store Locator.  Our Sites may allow you to search for the nearest store that offers the Stanley Black & Decker product that you want and whether such nearby stores have certain of our items in stock.  If you access one of our Sites through a mobile device and you have enabled location-based services, specific location information may be collected for these features.

This section applies to additional personal information that may be collected, used, and disclosed related to our Bluetooth® enabled products and related Sites (collectively our “Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Sites”).  If you access our Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Sites through a mobile device, we may collect and use your mobile device’s location services and Bluetooth® capabilities to identify the date, time and location of your mobile device when it was last in Bluetooth® range of a registered, Bluetooth® Enabled Product.  This is done to assist you in locating a registered Bluetooth® Enabled product.  We may also collect location information about your registered Bluetooth® Enabled product as sent to us via other users’ mobile devices, and location information about other users’ registered Bluetooth® Enabled products as sent to us via your mobile device.  (Bluetooth® is a registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Stanley Black & Decker is under license).
If you do not consent to have your browser provide location information or you disable location-based services on your mobile device, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip code; if you chose not to provide this information some features of the Sites may not be available.

We also use firewalls and have implemented other reasonable technical, administrative and physical measures designed to protect the personal information in our custody or control from unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure.  While we implement the above security measures on our Websites, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
