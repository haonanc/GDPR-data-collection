This information allows us to carry out internal research on our usersâ€™ interests, demographics and behaviour so that we can better understand, and in turn, provide better information, products and services to you and other customers.
If you register as a user of the Website or ask for further information about the Website, we ask for your name, email address, postal address, and other relevant personal information. Personal information submitted in this way is added to our access control database, hosted by a third party hosting company, and to our customer databases at OUP's and/or our affiliates' premises. This information will be updated if you inform us of any changes.
If you are a registered user, your personal information will be used to enable us to verify that you are a registered user and to deliver any restricted content and functionality on the Website to you.
If you sign up to receive newsletters, we will ask you for your email address and your name and this information will be added to our customer databases.
