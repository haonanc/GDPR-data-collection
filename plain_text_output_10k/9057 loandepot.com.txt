California Do Not Track Notice
Under California law, website and online service operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser âdo not trackâ signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumerâs online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not track our customerâs personal information over time and across third-party websites and therefore this requirement does not apply to us. California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their userâs online activities over time and across different sites when the users use the operatorâs website or service. Third parties that have content or services on our site such as a social feature, analytics service, or an advertising network partner, may obtain information about your browsing or usage habits but this information does not include personal information. We do not knowingly permit such third parties to collect any personal information from our site unless you directly provide it to us and we provide it to them with your consent.
Compliance with State and Federal Laws
This privacy policy may not constitute your entire set of privacy rights, as these may also vary from state to state. To be certain of your privacy rights, you may wish to contact the appropriate agency in your state that is charged with overseeing privacy rights of consumers. Certain regulations issued by state and/or federal government agencies may require us to maintain and report demographic information on the collective activities of our customers. We may also be required to maintain your personal information for at least seven years in order to be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws regarding recordkeeping, reporting and audits.
Link to Other Sites
We may offer links to partnerâs sites. We make the decision to provide links to these sites based on the quality of information provided at the time the links are enabled or to facilitate our customersâ more effective use of our website, and we make every effort to monitor the continuing quality of content provided on these sites. However, these external sites are not subject to this privacy policy and may have different privacy policies or approaches to the handling of information. loanDepot has no control over the content of these sites. Please consult the privacy policies on these sites before you provide them any of your personal information.
We also equip our servers with Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate technology to ensure that you when you connect to our website you are actually on our site. SSL also ensures that all data entered into the website is encrypted. To verify that SSL is being used, look for the key or padlock icon on your browser. For encryption protection, we use 128-bit secure browser for login and transactions. The application process utilizes âCAPTCHAâ technology, which is a test that we use to ensure certain sensitive transactions are being initiated by a human and not by another computer. The test involves viewing a distorted image of a word that a computer would not be able to interpret and then entering the text shown in the image. We subject our systems to periodic security audits to ensure that your information is thoroughly protected and secure.
Session time-outs
We employ session time-outs to protect your account. You will be logged out of the site automatically after a specified period of inactivity. This time-out feature reduces the risk of others being able to access your account if you leave your computer unattended.
Passwords
At a minimum, we require the use of both numbers and letters in your password. We have also instituted secure steps by which you can regain access to your account should you forget your password, including the use of a security question. Your password is not known to any employee or third party with whom we may partner, and we will never ask for your password as a means of identifying yourself. You should never share your password with anyone, and if you ever received an email purporting to come from loanDepot that asks for your password, you should immediately contact loanDepot.
What you can do
You can take several precautions to protect the security of your computer and personal information. For instance, you can start by using a well-chosen password. You should avoid using any information that others can easily learn about you, such as a family memberâs name or birthday, and you can also use specifically characters in place of letters. WE also recommend that you change your password often. You can also install and update antivirus and firewall software to protect your computer from external attacks by malicious users. When you are finished with a session on our site, be sure that you log out and close the browser window.
To protect your account, we send automatic notifications confirming certain actions taken on your account, such as changes to a password or external linked account. We do this for your own protection so that you can be sure no one else is making changes to your account without your knowledge. However, the security offered through these notifications can be undermined if other people have access to your email account. Therefore, you might consider restricting access to the email account you registered with on this site and/or changing your password on that email account frequently.
If you use a computer that is accessed by other people, such as in a public library or internet cafÃ©, we recommend that you take special precautions to protect the security of your account and personal data. When you are finished using your site, you should log out completely, then close the browser window and clear the browserâs cache file.
You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts to gain access to your account information known as âphishingâ. Phishing is a tactic used by scammers in which unsuspecting people are brought to a website by a genuine-looking email purporting to be from a legitimate company. The phony or âspoofâ email takes the person to a website that looks legitimate but in fact is not. Either in the email itself or on this fake site, scammers will ask for login information to gain access to peopleâs accounts and withdraw their money. loanDepot will never ask for login information to gain access to customerâs account and access sensitive information. loanDepot will never ask you for your login information in the context of any email, physical mail, phone call or otherwise. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by never providing personal or login information via an email instead, go to the website directly. You might also make it a habit to check the URL of a website to be sure that it begins with the correct domain. In the case of loanDepot Personal Loans, you should also ensure the URL begins with http://www.ldpersonalloans.com , https://www.ldpersonalloans.com .
