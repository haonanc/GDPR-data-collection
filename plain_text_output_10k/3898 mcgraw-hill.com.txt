McGraw-Hill Education only uses this information for tracking results on your assignments for your account.  Your contact information (including your name, address, and email address as requested) is not used for any other purpose and is only available to authorized persons for the purpose of technical support when necessary.

Collection and use of information from cookies
A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. This McGraw-Hill application uses cookies to recognize you when you log into your account.  This is done using temporary "session" cookies that grant you certain access privileges, such as access to your account and protected content.  These session cookies do not store any personally-identifiable information about you or your account.  As the sessions expire, the cookies are removed from this McGraw-Hill application.
You have the option to disable cookies in your browser.  Doing so, however, will effectively preclude you from using this McGraw-Hill application.  To disable cookies on your computer, you have to change your browser's preferences. In Internet Explorer (versions 6 and up), this option is listed under Tools > Internet Options > Privacy. The setting has to be set to Block All Cookies. In Netscape (versions 7 and up), this option is listed under Edit > Preferences > Privacy & Security > Cookies. The Disable Cookies button should be checked. Security information is specific to each browser and operating system. Please check with those specific companies for more information.
