Our Commitment to Privacy
This Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine quality products and services with integrity in dealing with users. The Policy is designed to assist you in the understanding of how LuLaRoe, LLC (“LuLaRoe,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects the personal information provided to us through use of www.lularoe.com and any other affiliated websites or other online or mobile services or applications (collectively the “Site”). LuLaRoe is the data controller for the Site.
What Information Do We Collect?
When you visit our Site, we collect two types of information: personal information you actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”), and use information collected in a way not visible to you on an anonymous aggregate basis as you and other users browse our Site (“Passive Information”).
1. Active Information
Active Information refers to information that you choose to disclose. It consists of Personally Identifiable Information that lets us know specifically about you. In order to gain use of some features of the Site, we may request that you disclose some or all of the following Personally Identifiable Information: name, address, phone number, email address, and/or birth date. We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the transmission of the information you submit to us when you use our secure online forms. The information you provide to us is stored securely.
A. Ordering
When you place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transactional information). We use this information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate the status of your order.
B. Credit Card Storage
Credit card information collected at registration or for product orders is used only to process payment for the transaction and, generally, is not retained on our Site. However, in some instances you may voluntarily elect to store credit cards to be used for product orders.
C. Surveys and Promotions
Occasionally, you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this information to improve our products and services and to ensure that we’re providing accurate disclosures. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information that coincide with your preferences. For information regarding opting out of receiving promotional materials, please refer to Section 3 below.
D. Registration
It may be possible to create a user account on the Site. In such instances, we may collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, phone number, email address, and/or birth date). This information is securely stored and may be accessed on the Site. Please safeguard any usernames or passwords you may receive as a result of any registration.
2. Passive Information
Passive Information is information that is collected on an anonymous and aggregate basis anytime you visit our Site. Passive Information that is collected includes Aggregate Information and Cookies.
A. Aggregate Information
Aggregate Information is information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. Such information includes the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content or our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.
We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you.
B. Cookies
Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data stored by a user’s browser to simplify subsequent interactions with the site. This makes it easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.
Our Site utilizes cookies to collect information about how our Site is used. Passive Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site, the sites visited just before and just after visiting our Site. If you do not wish to transmit “cookie” information about yourself, you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser.
Our Site’s servers also automatically identify your computer by its IP address, which is a unique string of numbers that are assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. The IP address may be used to address problems with our server or to gather broad demographic information about users. We passively collect your IP Address.
3. How Do We Use the Information Collected?
Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our direction use Active Information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer support and making available other products or services we think might be of interest to users. We may use information you provide to contact you about various changes to our Site, new services, features, or products we offer. This may include sending notifications, promotions, or other communications to you via email or SMS messaging. If at any time you do not wish to receive information related to marketing or sent for commercial purposes, you may unsubscribe by using the opt-out button provided in such messages.
We use Passive Information to gather information about users and to enhance our Site to make it easier, faster and friendlier for users. Additionally, cookies help us better understand the usage pattern of the people that visit our Site, which helps us improve our services, features, and products. Passive Information may result in your viewing of particular content based on your user habits.
