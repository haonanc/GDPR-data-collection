Where personal information is transferred to and stored in a country not determined by the European Commission as providing adequate levels of protection for personal information, we take steps to provide appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including:

•             under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (where we transfer personal information to the U.S.), which enables U.S. business to self-certify as a means of complying with EU data protection laws.

•             the transfer is necessary for the performance of our contractual engagement with you;

6.            SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
ATP is strongly committed to ensuring the security of any personal information that we obtain through our Website.
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personal information. Only authorised personnel and third party service providers are permitted access to personal information, and that access is limited by need.
Where data processing is carried out on our behalf by a third party, we take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to prevent unauthorised disclosure of personal information.
Despite these precautions, however, ATP cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted over the Internet or that unauthorised persons will not obtain access to personal information. In the event of a data breach, ATP have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where required to do so.
7.            HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Your personal information will not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and processed.
The criteria we use for retaining your personal information, includes the following:
•             Registered users – we will retain your information for so long as you are registered to receive newsletters and other communications from ATP. After you have ceased to be a registered user, we will retain your information for a period of 2 years.
•             Legal and regulatory requirements - we may need to retain personal information for up 7 years where necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our Terms of Use Agreement.
8.            ACCESS TO AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
You have the right to access information which we hold about you (“data subject access request”). We may refuse to comply with a subject access request if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or repetitive in nature.
You also have the right to receive your personal information in a structured and commonly used format so that it can be transferred to another data controller (“data portability”). The right to data portability only applies where your personal data is processed by us with your consent or for the performance of a contract and when processing is carried out by automated means.
We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information you think is inaccurate. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us. We may refuse to comply with a request for rectification if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or repetitive.
9.            RIGHT TO OBJECT
Direct marketing
You have the right to object at any time to our processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Where we process your information based on our legitimate interests
You also have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal information which is based on our legitimate interests. Where you object on this ground, we shall no longer process your personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
10.          YOUR OTHER RIGHTS
You also have the following rights under data protection laws to request that we rectify your personal information which is inaccurate or incomplete.
In certain circumstances, you have the right to:
•             request the erasure of your personal information erasure (“right to be forgotten”);
•             restrict the processing of your personal information to processing in certain circumstances.
Please note that the above rights are not absolute and we may be entitled to refuse requests, wholly or partly, where exceptions under the applicable law apply. We may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. We may refuse to comply with a request for restriction if the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive or repetitive in nature.
11.          EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS
You can exercise any of your rights as described in this privacy notice and under data protection laws by contacting us as provided in Contacting Us above.
Save as described in this privacy notice or provided under data protection laws, there is no charge for the exercise of your legal rights. However, if your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either: (a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act on the request.
Where we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the person making the request, we may request additional information necessary to confirm your identity.
