Registration
We request information from you on our subscription and order forms. This information is used for order fulfillment, customer service and to understand your areas of interest. We act as an agent to collect data for some of our partners that deliver products or services that consumers order.

This information is then securely provided to our partner or their agent for fulfillment.
Tracking Technology
If you have been offered our services through one of our marketing partners or affiliates (see "Use of Information" section below), we may share the information you enter with that partner or affiliate. To do so, we may use a technology called clear GIFs, which automatically and securely transfer the information you enter.
