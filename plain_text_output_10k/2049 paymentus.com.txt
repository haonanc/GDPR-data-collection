Your data may be disclosed to third parties in any or all of the following circumstances.

When our merchants need it to process a transaction you initiated: Where necessary, we will share certain information about you with our third party merchants to help facilitate the transactions. This data will never include your sensitive payment details (such as credit card number).

To the extent required by law: We will share your information with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law. For example, we are required by law to undergo certain routine audits, which may require us to share your information with the third party auditors we have engaged in relation to these requirements.

The necessity of all such disclosures will be determined in our sole discretion. For more information on our procedures related to legal requests, please review our law enforcement policy.
To the extent our legitimate business interests require us to do so, for example by transmitting it to our third party partners for inclusion on their blacklists or lists of terminated merchants, to help us engage in our fraud reduction efforts, to support our corporate governance activities or facilitate the sale or other transfer of all or part of our business, or to protect us or our service.
Data Retention
We are required to retain many types of your personal information by law, often for a period of several years. We may additionally retain your information for a longer period than is required by law to the extent it is in our legitimate business interests  to do so (for instance, we may retain it to prevent fraud on our service) and is not otherwise prohibited by law.
