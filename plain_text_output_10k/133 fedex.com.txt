What happens when I leave fedex.com to visit a FedEx linked web site?
Parts of fedex.com, such as FedEx Global Trade Manager, consist of products and services hosted by third-party businesses. When you leave fedex.com to visit one of these sites, the only information transferred to the third-party is the fact that you came from fedex.com (the referring address).

FedEx is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third-party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.
