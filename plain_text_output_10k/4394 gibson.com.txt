Privacy Policy
Quality and pride in all we do is the hallmark of the Gibson family of companies. The protection of your personal information and privacy is no exception. Our Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions about the policies and procedures we use to safeguard your personal information.
Information Covered
Our Privacy Policy applies to personally identifiable information collected on the Gibson.com(SM) website. It does not apply to information collected by us through any other means or information collected by other parties reached via links from our website. Personally identifiable information that we might ask you to provide might include your name, mailing and billing address, e-mail address and telephone number. In some instances, particularly where we are interested in gathering information about our customers to better design and manufacture products that meet your needs and wants, we might also ask about gender, age, number of children, other interests, range of household income and other such information. If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, we cannot accept your registration.
If you are purchasing merchandise directly from our website, we most likely will ask for credit card or other information relating to payment, and will maintain secure records of the product(s) purchased and the date the transaction occurred.
We also may keep a record of your IP address, which is the address associated with the point through which you enter the Internet when you access our website. While the IP address is not personally identifiable information by itself, it may be used as such when combined with personal information you may have provided on that visit, so we wanted you to know about it.
How Information Is Used
Gibson will never intentionally disclose any personally identifiable information about visitors to our website to any third party without first obtaining your express consent to do so, except as stated in our Terms and Conditions of Use regarding improper use of our website.
We may use the information we gather for internal purposes such as editorial feedback, marketing or promotional purposes, all of which helps us keep you up-to-date on the latest and greatest products, promotions contests and news from Gibson. It also helps us keep in touch with your thoughts about our products and your suggestions for future products and features.
We may collect your IP address for system administration purposes, or from time to time, to report aggregate information with our non-brand partners, including contest partners and event co-sponsors, but we will not share individual information with them.
Visitors under Age 13
We do not accept registrations from children under the age of thirteen (13). If you are a parent and believe that your child has registered on our website or is on our mailing list, please contact our legal department at:
