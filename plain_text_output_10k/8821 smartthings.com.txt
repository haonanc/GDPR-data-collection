If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, avatars, profile information, images, friends and other authorized information. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
If you have provided us with a means of contacting you, we may use such means to communicate with you. For example, we may send you updates about our services, informational updates, surveys or promotional offers (either on our own behalf, or on behalf of other businesses), or communicate with you about your use of the Services.

Information Collected Automatically
Whenever you interact with our Services (whether via a mobile application, our IoT plug-in, third party service, SmartApp, browser, or other application, connecting a physical device to our services, connecting a third party service to our services, or otherwise), we automatically receive and record information on our servers, logs and databases from your browser, application, services or device(s). In particular, our Services isare designed to allow you to connect various physical devices (e.g., the SmartThings Hub, and associated SmartThings and third party sensors and other devices) to the Services. While connected to the Services, these devices automatically report information to our servers (including information that you may have provided when setting up or configuring that device), which may include Personal Information. For example, if you connect a temperature sensor to the Services, the temperature information from that sensor will be transmitted to the Services, along with any identifying information that you have chosen to associate with that sensor (e.g., the device name, group name, and location name that you have assigned to the sensor within the Services). The type of information that is collected from each device will vary depending on the device type.
In addition, if you connect any video or audio recording devices to the Services (e.g., video cameras), and you enable the streaming or recording features of those devices through the service, then video or audio data from those devices may be transmitted to, and stored on, the Service, subject to your configuration and settings. We may capture, process and analyze this video and audio information to provide the Services (e.g., to detect motion or other activity, to provide you with notifications, to provide access to stored audio/video clips, etc.), and as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you choose not to enable video/audio storage or recording services through the Service for a particular device, then SmartThings does not store the video/audio information streamed from that device.
Other information collected automatically through the foregoing means may include your IP address, location details, "cookie" information, mobile device, operating system, the type of browser, demographic information, application and/or device(s) you're using to access our Services, click-through paths, the identity of the page or feature you are requesting or interacting with, time on page of feature, and other indicators of how you are interacting with the Services. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your device that allow us to recognize your browser, application or device and tell us how and when various pages and features in our Services are visited or used and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser, application or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. In addition, our third party partners, including advertising partners (discussed below), may also use web beacons, or transmit cookies to and read cookies from your browser, application or device when you visit or use our Services (including, without limitation, to collect information in connection with the Google Trusted Stores program or Google Demographics and Interests). Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. Also, please note that our systems do not currently recognize or respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals. To learn about what other options you have, scroll down to - What choices do I have?
Will SmartThings share any of the personal information it receives?
We share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:
Aggregated Personal Information that's no longer personally identifiable. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners such as Samsung or use that information forin marketing or promotional items (“aggregate information”). We may also provide aggregate information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services. However, except as described below, we do not disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.
Advertisers: We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners, including Samsung ("Advertisers") to choose the users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers. You agree that we may provide any of theaggregate information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers (“Targeted Advertising”). For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.  In addition to the foregoing, if you have not opted out of our targeted advertising feature as described below, you agree that we may share your personally identifiable information with Advertisers in order to deliver specific targeted advertising or offers to you ("Targeted Advertising"). For example, we might share with our Advertisers the fact that a moisture sensor that you have connected to our Services has detected a flood in order to show you ads or offers for local plumbing services. If we enable Targeted Advertising for our users by default, you will be able to opt out of Targeted Advertising at any time by changing your personal settings.
We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

Partners, Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control: In certain situations, partners, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with ("Affiliated Businesses") may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us), including reselling or providing SmartThings devices free of charge, providing third party devices, or delivering unique or custom SmartApps. You can recognize when an Affiliated Business is associated with such a transaction or service based on the presence of their brand or a transaction you are conducting directly with that Affiliated Business. We will share your Personal Information with that Affiliated Business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service, and to the extent that you have explicitly accepted incremental terms with that Affiliated Business whereby you acknowledge and authorize us to share your Personal Information. These incremental terms may be presented as part of promotional offers (either on the Affiliated Businesses' site or on SmartThings-branded properties including our commerce site at shop.smartthings.com, or within customized setup steps that appear in the Services. We have no control over the policies and practices of Affiliated Businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an Affiliated Business, please review all such business' or websites' policies. If you decide you no longer want to share Personal Information with an Affiliated Business, you may no longer be entitled to receive certain benefits from the Affiliated Business or have access to the Services without establishing a new account or relationship with SmartThings.
Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide our Servicesproducts or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, Oour agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us as identified in this Privacy Policy.
User Profiles and Submissions: Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user’s name, location, and any content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for SmartThings’s Services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload content through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of "friends" from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such "friends,"" if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.
Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
Protection of SmartThings and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of SmartThings, our employees, our users, or others.
