OVERVIEW
Ceridian is committed to protecting your personal data.  As part of this commitment, Ceridian has established a privacy program that demonstrates our due diligence to privacy laws.
SCOPE
This notice applies to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure, retention and deletion of personal data of users of our websites, individuals to whom we market directly and of customer’s personal data by Ceridian, its affiliates and third-party service providers. 
It applies to all personal data in Ceridian’s control, whether it is stored and/or processed on Ceridian property or stored and/or processed by a third-party service provider.  
If you are an individual whose employer uses a Ceridian application such as human capital management, and your employer has asked you to submit personal data as part of that service, you should review your employer’s separate privacy notice. 
If you are a business that has a contract with Ceridian you should review that contract for information concerning how Ceridian collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal that it collects from you, or your employees.
DEFINITIONS  
Controller
The natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
Customer
An organization who has entered into a business relationship with Ceridian to perform a service.
Individual
Personal Data
Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.  An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly by piecing information together.
Processing
Any activity which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data from collection through use and disposal, including storing and sharing with others.
Processor
A natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Ceridian, its employees, and contractors take responsibility for personal data in accordance with Ceridian policies and standards. Ceridian’s Chief Privacy Officer, Lisa Clapes, is responsible for defining the requirements of this policy and for ensuring compliance with its provisions. The Chief Information Security Officer, Ron Joyal, is responsible for implementing and maintaining appropriate controls and measures to enable compliance. Ceridian trains its employees with respect to its privacy policies and practices including Ceridian's Ten Privacy Principles.
Ceridian acts as a processor when it processes the personal data of its customers, who are the controllers, in products such as Dayforce, PowerPay, etc. Customer personal data is owned by the customer and Ceridian manages the personal data at the direction of its customers.  
In some instances, Ceridian acts as a controller, which means that Ceridian owns and controls the personal data that is being processed. Examples include, but are not limited to:
Collecting and using personal data for direct marketing purposes of customers and prospective customers
Managing Ceridian’s business operations
Ceridian is liable for personal data it processes and for personal data Ceridian provides to third-party service providers for processing. With respect to personal data that has been transferred to a third-party service provider to be processed, contractual requirements are used to provide a comparable level of protection. Ceridian’s liability for a third-party’s performance of its obligations is set forth in each agreement that Ceridian signs with its Customers, and Ceridian assumes liability for the performance of the services and obligations subcontracted to such third-party service providers, including those related to the protection of personal data.
Our services also involve the transfer of personal data to third parties (for example, banks, retirement program providers and tax agencies) as instructed by our customers. In these cases, Ceridian does not have a direct relationship with the third party and is not liable for the processing of personal data in their possession. These third parties have their own independent obligations with respect to the personal data, usually by operation of law or through contracts with Ceridian’s customers. 
Our website, our emails, or our application may link to third parties’ websites. It is also possible that third parties’ websites or emails may link to our website. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by third parties and personal data collected by third parties is not governed by Ceridian’s privacy notice. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these websites before transmitting any personal data to third parties. 
THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
Personal data is collected by fair and lawful means.  Ceridian provides notice as to the purposes for which personal data is collected, used, retained, and disclosed.  
In most cases, Ceridian’s customers are responsible for notification of purpose and for obtaining appropriate consent when they collect personal data and transfer it to Ceridian.  Personal data that is transferred to Ceridian by our customers to be processed shall be deemed to have been collected with appropriate notification. Ceridian assumes no responsibility for obtaining or validating that appropriate consent has been obtained in respect of personal data transferred to Ceridian by organization(s) and/or customers.
Ceridian collects personal data from customers and customers’ employees for the purposes of providing, and promoting the services we offer (including initiating, maintaining, enhancing, and terminating the employee-employer relationship), benchmarking and analytics, continuous improvement and development of products, services and software, and for the operation of Ceridian’s business, for example, and needed to comply with legal obligations. 
Sometimes, other companies may provide us with the contact information of businesses or individuals who they think may be interested in our products or services. We may also collect contact information from publicly available sources.
Relevant information collected as required to deliver requested services may include, for example, the following categories of data: 
Personal details such as name, birth date, national ID number, marital status, etc.
Contact details such as address, email address, telephone number, etc.
Payment details, including bank account number
Details of employment, education and training
Qualifications, including CV/resume and references
Authentication Credentials to use the services, such as username, IP address, PC Name, etc.
Activities performed by customer users in their use of the services
In some cases, Ceridian collects personal data directly from the individual, for example, when individuals visit a Ceridian website. In these cases, Ceridian is responsible for obtaining appropriate consent, except where inappropriate or if the collection is required/permitted by law without consent. 
Individuals who seek to vary or withdraw consent that has been obtained by Ceridian directly may do in writing in the manner set out in the “Monitoring and Enforcement” section of this policy. If you decide you do not want to receive commercial emails from Ceridian you can “opt-out” by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided at the bottom of every commercial email or by clicking here .  Subject to legal or contractual restrictions, Ceridian shall abide by the withdrawal or variation of consent, and shall advise the individual of the consequences of a change in the scope of consent. In cases where consent has been obtained by the customer, the individual will be referred to the customer.
On our website, we may collect personal data from you in the following ways: 
By Asking - We may collect some personal data from you by asking that you provide it to us. For instance, if you fill out an inquiry form we may ask you for your email address or other business contact information in order to access certain promotional materials.

Unless required by law, Ceridian shall not use or disclose personal data for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining the appropriate consent.
DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE
Do Not Track (DNT) is a preference that users can set for their browsers to opt out of the online tracking activities by some websites. Ceridian does not track its customers over time and across third party websites and thus does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals in browsers.
