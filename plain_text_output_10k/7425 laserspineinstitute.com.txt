In exchange for SPINN providing you with access to the Service, you consent to SPINN collecting and using technical data, personal information and related information in connection with your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, contact information and technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that are gathered periodically to facilitate the features and functionality of the Service and of software updates, product support and other services. You also consent to our communicating with you about the Service.
COMPATIBILITY WITH MOBILE DEVICES
SPINN does not warrant that the Service will be compatible or interoperable with your mobile device or any other hardware, software or equipment installed on or used in connection with your mobile device.
CARRIER CHARGES
The Service requires and uses phone service, data access and text messaging capabilities. Carrier rates for phone, data and text messaging may apply, and you are responsible for all of these charges.
PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS
SPINN attempts to be as accurate as possible. If you have reason to believe that a Roast you purchsed through the Service or other product or feature does not meet the claims advertised within the Service, you must contact SPINN immediately (and in any case no later than three business days following the check-in date or feature request date). Your failure to contact us within this period may affect our ability to investigate and resolve your claim.
ADVERTISED PRICES
SPINN makes no guarantee that the prices advertised through the Service represent (i) the lowest price for a specific coffee (ii) the published price for a specific coffee on another website or publication not affiliated with SPINN.
BUYING COFFEE THROUGH THE SPINN SERVICE
When you buy coffee using the Service, you are representing the following: (i) any credit information you supply is true and complete; (ii) the selected coffees will be honored by your credit card company and (iii) you will pay the posted price for the coffee, even if connected roasters will be able to increase coffee pricing. Posted coffee rates include applicable taxes. We will not issue Value Added Taxes (VAT) invoices for any purchases made through the Service.
TAXES AND FEES
When you buy coffee using the Service, we facilitate your purchase with the roaster and will charge your method of payment for Taxes and Fees. This amount includes an estimated amount to recover the amount we pay the roaster for taxes owed by the roaster, including, without limitation, sales tax and or value added tax and other taxes. In some cities, the tax may include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to a taxing authority but still required by law. The amount paid to the roaster for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate. The balance of the amount in Taxes and fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your purchase, including customer service costs. The amounts for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the roaster, and may include profit we retain.
For purchses in certain jurisdiction, Taxes and Fees includes a payment of tax we are required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services. In every other jurisdiction, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. Our roasters include all applicable taxes in the amount we are required to pay over to them. We are not a co-vendor with the roaster. Tax rates and the type of taxes vary greatly by location.
INAVAILABILITY AND CANCELLATIONS
If a roaster is unable to honor your purchase, contact us immediately, and we will work with you and the roaster to find you an alternative roast.
Any purchase of a roast through the Service is definitive. We may, in our sole discretion, provide SPINN credits for cancelled purchases.
PROMOTIONS
Personal Invite Code and Credits
You can earn credits by inviting friends and family to download and purchase coffee using your personal invite code. After creating your SPINN account, you will receive a personal invite code. If you share that code with friends and family, they can receive $10 off their first purchase of at least $25 or equivalent (excluding taxes and fees).
Your personal invite code may only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. Feel free to share your invite code with your friends and family via email, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, personal blogs, etc. where you are the primary content owner. However you cannot distribute your invite code on sites where you are a contributor but not the primary content owner (e.g., Wikipedia, coupon websites, app stores and app review websites) and you cannot promote your invite code via Search Engine Marketing (e.g., AdWords/Yahoo/Bing).
Credits expire one year from the date they are earned. Credits will be applied to coffee purchases in the corresponding currency. Example: SPINN credits stated in USD will only be applied to roasters billed in USD. SPINN credits (however earned) are not redeemable for cash or cash equivalents, are non-transferable and may not be applied towards prior purchases. Other restrictions may apply.
Promo Code Policy
If you are using a promo code, such as our “ROAST” code for first time users or another promo code we advertise, unless otherwise specified, eligible users must have a total charge of at least US $50 or equivalent (excluding taxes and fees) and be made on the SPINN app for you to use the code. Promo codes may be available in a limited quantity and we reserve the right to “retire” a promo code at anytime, meaning you might find an old promo code out there that is no longer valid. Expiration dates of promo codes cannot be changed or extended. Promo codes can only be applied to future purchases and cannot be applied towards prior purchases.
Promo codes are valid for a single use per SPINN user and are not transferable to another user or redeemable for cash. Codes may not be combined with another SPINN coupon or discount code. SPINN reserves the right to any remedy, including denial of the discount or cancellation of your account or purchases, if fraud, tampering, or violations are of the terms found to occur. Additional restrictions may apply.
If you break any of the rules applicable to personal invite codes or promo codes, the SPINN Grinch may take all of your credits away, cancel a promo code and/or suspend your account.
