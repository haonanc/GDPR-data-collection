Service Providers: We may share your information with service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf (such as to host the Services, fulfill orders, provide products and services, manage databases, perform analyses, process credit card payments, provide customer service, or send communications for us).  We may share information with third-parties, such as social networking platforms, so that they may send tailored communications on our behalf via their platforms.

Select Business Partners: With your prior permission, we may share your information with select business partners so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you. For example, you may be presented with an opportunity to have certain information shared with our third party business partners when you enter a contest or sweepstakes or elect to receive marketing offers or other information. If you do not elect to have your information shared, it will not be shared with such third parties. We take measures to help ensure that our partners protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any information we share with them. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.
Contests and Sweepstakes:  In some cases, a third party may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Services, and collect your information. In those cases, we urge you to review the third party's privacy policy for that contest or sweepstakes before participating. We take measures to help ensure that our partners protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of any information we share with them. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.

7.  Links to Other Websites
The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith. This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.
8.  Data Security and Data Integrity
We have adopted security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, interference, disclosure, destruction, alteration and unauthorized access to the information you provide to us.

We also maintain reasonable procedures to help ensure that such data is reliable for its intended use and is accurate, complete and current.
Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

10. Children's Privacy
The Services do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.

Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In some cases, third parties may be able to collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Services.
13.  Changes To This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

By using the Services, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, pursuant to the laws of the United States. While some of these countries may not offer the same level of privacy protection as your own, we commit to uphold the privacy protections as explained in this Policy and take appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your information are bound to duties of confidentiality and where applicable we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing GDPR@nfl.com .
15.  Users from the European Union
This section of the Privacy Policy applies only if you use our website or Services covered by this Privacy Policy from a country that is a Member State of the European Union, (the "EU"), and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy.
In addition to collecting and processing your Personal Data via your use of the Services, as described in this Privacy Policy (see section entitled "Information Collection"), NFL will also collect and process your Personal Data when you attend an NFL Event (as defined below) in the EU.  This section of the privacy Policy describes that collecting and processing.
[NFL Enterprises LLC] is the data controller for processing of information defined as personal data under applicable data protection law ("Personal Data") when you use the Services.
NFL International LLC is the data controller for processing personal information collected when you attend an NFL Event in the EU.
Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which NFL Fan Mobile Pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event.  You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g. as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game).  In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Policy, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed.
How we use the Personal Data collected at an NFL Event: We will use the Personal Data:
to produce, exhibit, advertise or otherwise use your image, voice or likeness in any and all media now or existing in future as part of NFL's commercial, advertising and marketing activities; and
in the case of images or footage captured on CCTV cameras, to ensure the safety of the venues hosting NFL Events and of individuals attending NFL Events.
Legal Basis for Data Processing: We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, as described above. Our legal basis to process personal data includes processing that is: necessary for the performance of the contract between you and the NFL (for example, to provide you with the Services you request and to identify and authenticate you so you may use the website); necessary to comply with legal requirements (for example, to comply with applicable accounting rules and to make mandatory disclosures to law enforcement as well as to ensure your safety and the safety of our venues if you attend an NFL Event); necessary for our legitimate interests (for example, to manage our relationship with you and to improve the website and our Services, and for NFL's commercial, advertising and marketing activities); and based on consent by our customers (for example, to communicate with you about our products and services and provide you with marketing information), which may subsequently be withdrawn at any time (by emailing GDPR@nfl.com ) without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
In some instances, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data for processing as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services, and for you to use all the features of our website.
Automated Decision-Making: We use automated decision-making technologies, including profiling, to support our data processing activities. Our automated decision-making capabilities include logic that will send triggered messages based on fan data or behaviour.  By using this logic, it helps us provide a better fan experience or you, this means that receiving messages based on data you have provided (for example a birthday email) or a behaviour (watching a video).
Sharing your Personal Data from an NFL Event: We may share your Personal Data captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Policy (see section entitled "Sharing of Information").  Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may share that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness with our third party partners.  These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers and/or broadcasters.  We will share the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so.  However, each of the third party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL.
Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event.  Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your Personal Data and NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your Personal Data and for what purposes.
Transfers: When we transfer your Personal Data to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, some of these parties (for example, many members of the NFL Family) may be located in countries, such as the United States, other than your own, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, including the United States, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information and comply with applicable laws. For example, we implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred Personal Data, remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing enquiries@nfl.com .
Your Rights: You may be entitled, in accordance with applicable law, to object to or request the restriction of processing of your Personal Data, and to request access to, rectification, of (e.g. if your Personal Data changes or is out of date), erasure of and portability of your own Personal Data in certain circumstances.  Requests should be submitted by contacting us by emailing GDPR@nfl.com .
If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law.
