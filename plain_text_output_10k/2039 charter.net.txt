Signing Rules
Charter takes the protection of our subscribers' ("You," "Your" or "Customer(s)") privacy seriously. The following privacy policy ("Policy") applies to those Charter residential Customers who subscribe to Charter's residential video programming, high-speed Internet and/or telephone service (individually and collectively the "Service") and describes the Customer information that Charter collects and retains, how Charter uses and protects it, the limited cases where Charter may disclose some or all of that information, and Your rights under the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 ("Cable Act"). Depending upon the Charter Service to which You subscribe, parts of this Policy may not be applicable to You. Charter values Your privacy and considers all personally identifiable information contained in our business records to be confidential. Please review this Policy and, if You are a Charter telephone service subscriber, the attached Customer Proprietary Network Information ("CPNI") Policy (the "CPNI Policy"), in conjunction with Your service agreement, terms of service and acceptable use policy ("Your Service Agreement"). Charter will provide You copies of this Policy annually and the CPNI Policy at least once every two years, whether or not we have revised the policies. We may modify this Policy at any time. The most current version of this Policy can be found on www.charter.com . If you find the changes unacceptable and if those changes materially and adversely impact Your use of the Service, You may have the right to cancel Your Service under Your Service Agreement. If You continue to use the Service following the posting of a revised Policy, we will consider that to be Your acceptance of and consent to the Policy as revised.
What type of information does Charter collect?
Charter collects both personally identifiable information and non-personal information about You when You subscribe to our Service. Charter uses its system to collect personally identifiable information about You: (a) when it is necessary to provide our services to You; (b) to prevent unauthorized reception of our services; and (c) as otherwise provided in this Policy. Charter will not use the system to collect Your personally identifiable information for other purposes without Your prior written or electronic consent. Charter also collects personally identifiable and non-personal information about You when You voluntarily provide information to Charter, as may be required under applicable law, and from third parties, as described in this Policy.
Personally identifiable information is any information that identifies or can potentially be used to identify, contact, or locate You. This includes information that is used in a way that is personally identifiable, including linking it with identifiable information from other sources, or from which other personally identifiable information can easily be derived, including, but not limited to, name, address, phone or fax number, email address, spouses or other relatives' names, drivers license or state identification number, financial profiles, social security number, bank account information, and credit card information. Personally identifiable information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual or household) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual or household.
Non-personal information, which may or may not be aggregated information about our Customers and may include information from third parties, does not identify individual Customers. Charter may combine third party data with our business records as necessary to better serve our Customers. Examples of non-personal information include IP addresses, MAC addresses or other equipment identifiers, among other data. Our systems may automatically collect certain non-personal information when You use an interactive or transactional service. This information is generally required to provide the service and is used to carry out requests a Customer makes through a remote control or set-top box.
We may also collect and maintain information about Your account, such as billing, payment and deposit history; maintenance and complaint information; correspondence with or from You, information about the service options that You have chosen; information the equipment You have, including specific equipment identifiers; and information about Your use of our services, including the type, technical arrangement, quantity, destination and amount of use of certain of those services, and related billing for those services.
Charter also collects customer-provided customization settings and preferences. By using our service, You consent to our collection of this information and other information communicated to Charter such as correspondence, responses to surveys or emails, information provided in chat sessions with us, registration information, or participation in promotions or contests.
If You subscribe to our video service, then in certain of our systems, our set-top boxes automatically collect information that may be used to determine which programs are most popular, how many set-top boxes are tuned to watch a program to its conclusion and whether commercials are being watched, as well as other audience-measurement focused information. Our processes are designed to track this information and audience statistics on an anonymous basis. Information such as channel tuning, the time the channel is changed, and when the set-top box is "on" or "off" is collected at a secure database in an anonymous format. Charter, or our contractors or agents, may from time to time share the anonymous information with our advertisers, content providers, or other third parties with whom we have a relationship. We will not provide our advertisers, content providers, or these other third parties with personally identifiable information about You unless we have received Your consent first, except as required by law. (See "Who sees the information collected by Charter?")
Why does Charter collect personally identifiable information?
Charter collects and uses personally identifiable information to:
If You use an interactive or transactional service, for example, responding to a survey or ordering a pay-per-view event, the system will collect certain additional personally identifiable information, such as account and billing information or Customer-provided locale and service preferences, to properly bill You for the services purchased and to provide You with a more personalized experience. In addition, certain information such as Your connections to our system is automatically collected to, for example, make it possible for Your digital boxes to receive and process the signals for the services You order.
Charter may also collect personally identifiable information from third parties to enhance our customer database for use in marketing and other activities. Charter also collects personally identifiable information from third parties to verify information You have provided us and collects personally identifiable information from credit reporting agencies to, for example, determine Your creditworthiness, credit score, and credit usage. Charter also may maintain research records containing information obtained through voluntary subscriber interviews or surveys.
If You subscribe to our high-speed Internet service, Charter transmits personally identifiable and non-personal identifiable information about You over the Service when You send and receive e-mail and instant messages, transfer and share files, make files accessible, visit websites, or otherwise use the Service and its features. Our transmission of this information is necessary to allow You to use the Service as You have chosen and to render the Service to You.
Who sees the information collected by Charter?
Charter will only disclose personally identifiable information to others if: (a) Customer provides written or electronic consent in advance, or (b) it is permitted or required under federal or applicable state law. Specifically, federal law allows Charter to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties:
To provide services and carry out our business activities, certain authorized people have access to Your information, including our employees, entities affiliated through common ownership or control with Charter and third parties that provide and/or include: billing and collection services; installation, repair and customer service subcontractors or agents; program guide distributors; software vendors; program and other service suppliers for audit purposes; marketers of Charter's products and services; third party auditors; our attorneys and accountants; and/or strategic partners offering or providing products or services jointly or on behalf of Charter. The frequency of disclosures varies according to business needs, and may involve access on a regular basis. Charter restricts third parties' use of Your information to the purposes for which it is disclosed and prohibits third parties from further disclosure or use of Your personally identifiable information obtained from us, whether for that third party's own marketing purposes or otherwise.
Unless You object in advance, federal law also allows Charter to disclose through "mailing lists," personally identifiable information, such as Your name, address and the level of Your service subscription, to non-affiliated entities, including advertisers and marketing entities, for non-service related purposes, including product advertisement, direct marketing and research. Under no circumstances will Charter disclose to these advertising entities the extent of Your viewing habits or the transactions You make over the system. Charter, or our contractors or agents, may from time to time share non-personal and/or aggregate information such as the number of Service subscribers who match certain statistical profiles (for example, the number of subscribers in various parts of the country) with our advertisers, content providers, or other third parties with whom we have a relationship.
We may provide anonymous data to third parties who may combine it with other information to conduct more comprehensive audience analysis for us and for television advertisers. This data helps program networks and cable operators decide on which programs, channels, and advertising to carry. Charter may also use that information to distribute targeted advertising to You without having disclosed any of Your personally identifiable information to the advertisers. These advertisements may invite interactive or transactional follow-up from You. By using any of Charter's interactive services, You consent to our collection of this additional information. Unless You consent first or except as required by law, only anonymous information is disclosed to audience measurement services.
As part of its business activities, if Charter enters into a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Charter may transfer Customers' personally identifiable and non-personal information as part of the transaction.
If You subscribe to our telephone service, Your name, address and/or telephone number may be transmitted via Caller ID, published and distributed in affiliated or unaffiliated telephone directories, and available through affiliated or unaffiliated directory assistance operators. We take reasonable precautions to ensure that non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in the telephone directories or directory assistance services, although we cannot guarantee that errors will never occur. Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of Your name and/or telephone number when You dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll-free 800, 866, 877 or 888 numbers.
If allowed by and after complying with any federal law requirements, Charter may disclose personally identifiable information about Customer to representatives of government or to comply with valid legal process, except as provided below, disclosures shall not include records revealing Customer's selection of video programming. Disclosures to representatives of government may be made pursuant to an administrative subpoena, warrant, court order, our reasonable discretion in cases of emergency or serious physical injury, or other permitted means. In these situations, Charter may be required to disclose personally identifiable information about a Customer without Customer's consent and without notice to the Customer. Law enforcement agencies may, by federal or state court order, and without notice to You, obtain the right to install a device that monitors Your Internet and e-mail use, including addresses of email sent and received and in some cases the content of those communications; and/or Your use of our telephone service, including listings of incoming and outgoing calls and in some cases the content of those calls. In some instances where there are valid legal requests for or orders for disclosure of Your information, we may notify You of the requests or orders and then it may be up to You to object or take specific action to prevent any disclosures pursuant to those requests or orders.
Where a governmental entity is seeking personally identifiable information of a Customer who subscribes to Charter's video services only or records revealing Customer's selection of video programming, the Cable Act requires a court order and that the video subscriber be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest in a court proceeding relevant to the court order any claims made in support of the court order. At such a proceeding, the Cable Act requires the governmental entity to offer clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the prosecution of the case. Except in certain situations (such as with respect to those who owe, or are owed, welfare or child support) state welfare agencies may obtain the names, addresses, and certain other Customer information as it appears in Charter's subscriber records under the authority of an administrative subpoena.
We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about You without Your consent (a) to protect our Customers, employees, or property, (b) in emergency situations, (c) to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with You, for violations of service terms, conditions or policies and/or (d) in order to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or as otherwise required by law, for example, as part of a regulatory proceeding.
Note to California Customers Regarding Your Privacy Rights:
California law requires Charter provide to certain Customers, upon request, certain information regarding the sharing of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As mentioned above, Charter does not share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. However, Charter may share personally identifiable information with some same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes (and, if a Charter telephone subscriber, then subject to the restrictions in the attached CPNI Policy). If You make a request by phone or on-line, Charter will provide You with the number of its same-branded affiliates in California and a list of personal information that it may have shared with some or all such affiliates.
Can I prohibit or limit CharterÓ³ use and disclosure of my personally identifiable information?
If You do not want Your name, address, level of service or other personally identiable information disclosed to third parties in a "mailing list" as explained above, please register this preference at http://unsubscribe.charter.com or by contacting us by telephone at 1-888-GET-CHARTER. Customers of our video service cannot opt-out of the collection of audience measurement data.
Also, if You do not want to receive marketing messages (e.g., phone calls, emails, and direct mail) from Charter, You may call 1-888-GET-CHARTER or visit http://unsubscribe.charter.com and make a request to have your privacy preferences updated. Please note that such request will not eliminate all telephone calls, emails or direct mail sent to You from Charter as Charter may still continue to send non-marketing account-related messages to You.
How long does Charter maintain personally identifiable information?
Charter will maintain personally identifiable information about You as long as You are a subscriber to Charter's Service and as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. If You are no longer a subscriber to any Charter Service and the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, Charter will only keep personally identifiable information as long as necessary to comply with laws governing our business. These laws include, but are not limited to, tax and accounting requirements that require record retention. Charter will also maintain personally identifiable information to satisfy pending requests for access by a subscriber to his/her information or pursuant to a court order. Charter will destroy Customers' personally identifiable information when the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, when there are no longer pending requests for such information, and when it is no longer necessary to retain the information under applicable laws.
How does Charter protect customer information?
Charter takes the security of our Customers' personally identifiable information seriously. Charter takes such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter to personally identifiable information. Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive personally identifiable information when it collects such information over the system. Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. Charter limits access to databases containing Customers' personally identifiable information to those specifically authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the "Who sees the information collected by Charter?" section above. However, we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personally identifiable information.
You need to help protect the privacy of Your own information. You and others who use Your equipment must not give identifying information to strangers or others whom You are not certain have a right or need to the information. You also must take precautions to protect the security of any personally identifiable information that You may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of Your personally identifiable information. You are responsible for the security of Your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks in Your home. For more information on things You can do to help protect the privacy of Your own information, visit www.charter.com/security or www.OnGuardOnline.gov .
Can I see the information that Charter collects about me?
You have a right under the Cable Act to see Your personally identifiable information that Charter collects and maintains. The information Charter has about its Customers is maintained at the local offices where service is provided, in our systems, and at our corporate headquarters. If You would like to see Your information, please send a written request to Your local Charter office. To find the location of Your local office please visit www.charter.com . Charter will be glad to make an appointment for You to come in to Your local office during regular business hours. If Your review reveals an error in our records, Charter will correct it. You may also be able to access certain information about You or Your account by telephone or online at www.charter.com , depending upon the information You have provided.
Does Charter protect childrenÓ³ privacy?
Charter is concerned about children's privacy and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 over its Service unless otherwise expressly identified. At those specific parts of our Service, Charter will provide a special notice or other information describing the additional privacy protections that may apply. Charter urges children to always obtain a parent or legal guardian's permission before sending any information about themselves over the Internet and urges parents and legal guardians to be vigilant regarding children's Internet usage. Other services or web pages accessed through Charter's Service may have different policies on collection of information pertaining to children and You should consult their privacy policies and read their notices if You have any concerns about the collection or use of such information by those entities.
How does Charter use cookies and web beacons?
A cookie is a small file that stores information in Your browser on Your computer. Charter places cookies in Your browser that contain some of the information You provide when You register with us and when You set up a personalized service or customize Your settings and preferences on our websites. Charter does not store highly sensitive personal information such as Your password, e-mail address or credit card number in cookies. Cookies enable Charter to summarize overall usage patterns for analysis. In addition, Charter uses cookies to provide personalized services such as saving Your astrological sign on Charter.net. Charter may also use cookies to provide a more useful online experience, such as allowing You to quickly enter a sweepstakes if You're already logged on.
A web beacon is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about Your use of a given site. Like cookies, web beacons allow Charter and its technology providers to summarize overall usage patterns for our analysis and provide personalized services. Charter does not share or provide personally identifiable information we may collect, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers with our advertisers without Your express permission. However, Charter may provide site usage information linked to Your personally identifiable information to law enforcement or others in compliance with valid legal process or in other situations as stated in the "Who Sees the Information Collected by Charter?" paragraphs above.
You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by Charter on its websites by changing the setting on Your browser. Depending on Your privacy settings, please be aware that this may disable all cookies delivered to Your browser, not just the ones delivered by Charter.
Charter wants to make the advertisements it provides more relevant to You. Charter collects and uses non-personal information, such as information about your visits to our websites, ZIP Code, IP address and information from third parties. We may also combine that information with personally identifiable information, such as information You provide Charter and from Your Charter account. (See "What type of Information does Charter Collect"). In addition, Charter may partner with third-party advertising companies who may utilize cookies, web beacons, or other technology to deliver or facilitate the delivery of targeted advertisements.
Charter uses third-party advertising companies to identify and present tailored online advertisements for its goods and services and uses anonymous ZIP Codes to geographically target online advertisements for our other clients. Charter will not provide these online partners with access to Your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information without Your permission. When targeted online advertisements displayed on third-party websites are based on Your personally identifiable information or general location derived from your Charter IP address, You may opt-out by going to http://unsubscribe.charter.com and updating Your privacy preferences. After doing so, we recommend that You also remove any unwanted cookies from Your browser. For more information on how to adjust these settings go to Charter.com > Support > Internet Help.
Some of the advertisements You see on cable channels are placed by us. Some of those advertisements are placed in particular shows or channels; others are shown in particular geographic areas. Some of our cable advertisements will ask for Your permission to take certain actions, like mail You information or allow the advertiser to contact You; if You grant permission, we will use Your personal information for the permitted purposes only. In some areas we will be able to target cable advertisements to Your household that will be more relevant to Your interests based on information You provide us or information that we receive from third parties. When those cable advertisements are directed to You based on Your personal information, You can elect not to receive them. You may opt-out by going to http://unsubscribe.charter.com and updating Your privacy preferences.
If you change or get a new account, You will need to review all of Your opt-out choices.
What can I do if I believe Charter has violated my rights?
You may enforce the limitations imposed on us by federal law with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable subscriber information about You, through a civil action under federal law, in addition to other rights and remedies that may be available to You under federal or other applicable laws.
What if I have any questions?
If You have any questions about our privacy protections and policies, please contact Your local customer service office. You can find the phone number for Your local customer service office on Your monthly bill statement or by visiting Charter's website at www.charter.com .

Charter Residential Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) Policy
TThe following CPNI Policy is in addition to requirements set forth in Charter's Residential Subscriber Privacy Policy and is subject to some permitted uses and disclosures of Your name, address, and/or telephone number outlined in the Privacy Policy. The information that we have (1) relating to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of Your use of telephone service, and / or (2) contained on Your telephone bill concerning the telephone services that You receive is subject to additional privacy protections. That information, when matched to Your name, address, and telephone number is known as "Customer Proprietary Network Information," or CPNI for short. Examples of CPNI include information typically available from details on a customer's monthly telephone bill -- the type of line, technical characteristics, class of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns. As a subscriber to our telephone services, You have the right, and Charter has a duty, under federal law to protect the confidentiality of CPNI. Charter offers many communications-related services, such as, for example, Charter Internet services. From time to time we would like to use the CPNI information we have on file to provide You with information about our communications-related products and services or special promotions. Our use of CPNI may also enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to Your specific needs. We would like Your approval so that we, our agents, affiliates, joint venture partners, and independent contractors may use this CPNI to let You know about communications-related services other than those to which You currently subscribe that we believe may be of interest to You. You do have the right to restrict this use of CPNI.
IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS NOTIFICATION, WE WILL ASSUME THAT YOU APPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED SERVICES. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISAPPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI, AND MAY DENY OR WITHDRAW OUR RIGHT TO USE YOUR CPNI AT ANY TIME BY CALLING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER REFLECTED ON YOUR MONTHLY BILLING STATEMENT OR 1-888-GET-CHARTER. We will also honor any restrictions applied by state law, to the extent applicable. Charter also offers various other services that are not related to the communications services to which You subscribe. Under the CPNI rules, some of those services, such as Charter video services, are considered to be non-communications related services. Occasionally, You may be asked during a telephone call with one of our representatives for Your oral consent to Charter's use of Your CPNI for the purpose of providing You with an offer for products or services not related to the telephone services to which You subscribe. If You provide Your oral consent for Charter to do so, Charter may use Your CPNI for the duration of such telephone call in order to offer You additional services. Any action that You take to deny or restrict approval to use Your CPNI will not affect our provision to You, now or in the future, of any service to which You subscribe. You may disregard this notice if You previously contacted us in response to a CPNI Notification and denied use of Your CPNI for the purposes described above. Any denial of approval for use of Your CPNI outside of the service to which You already subscribe is valid until such time as Your telephone services are discontinued or You affirmatively revoke or limit such approval or denial. The CPNI Policy above may be required by law to apply to our Voice over Internet Protocol, or, IP voice services.
Effective: May 4, 2009

Who sees the information collected by Charter?
Charter will only disclose personally identifiable information to others if: (a) Customer provides written or electronic consent in advance, or (b) it is permitted or required under federal or applicable state law. Specifically, federal law allows Charter to disclose personally identifiable information to third parties:
To provide services and carry out our business activities, certain authorized people have access to Your information, including our employees, entities affiliated through common ownership or control with Charter and third parties that provide and/or include: billing and collection services; installation, repair and customer service subcontractors or agents; program guide distributors; software vendors; program and other service suppliers for audit purposes; marketers of Charter's products and services; third party auditors; our attorneys and accountants; and/or strategic partners offering or providing products or services jointly or on behalf of Charter. The frequency of disclosures varies according to business needs, and may involve access on a regular basis. Charter restricts third parties' use of Your information to the purposes for which it is disclosed and prohibits third parties from further disclosure or use of Your personally identifiable information obtained from us, whether for that third party's own marketing purposes or otherwise.
Unless You object in advance, federal law also allows Charter to disclose through "mailing lists," personally identifiable information, such as Your name, address and the level of Your service subscription, to non-affiliated entities, including advertisers and marketing entities, for non-service related purposes, including product advertisement, direct marketing and research.

We take reasonable precautions to ensure that non-published and non-listed numbers are not included in the telephone directories or directory assistance services, although we cannot guarantee that errors will never occur. Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of Your name and/or telephone number when You dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll-free 800, 866, 877 or 888 numbers.
If allowed by and after complying with any federal law requirements, Charter may disclose personally identifiable information about Customer to representatives of government or to comply with valid legal process, except as provided below, disclosures shall not include records revealing Customer's selection of video programming. Disclosures to representatives of government may be made pursuant to an administrative subpoena, warrant, court order, our reasonable discretion in cases of emergency or serious physical injury, or other permitted means. In these situations, Charter may be required to disclose personally identifiable information about a Customer without Customer's consent and without notice to the Customer. Law enforcement agencies may, by federal or state court order, and without notice to You, obtain the right to install a device that monitors Your Internet and e-mail use, including addresses of email sent and received and in some cases the content of those communications; and/or Your use of our telephone service, including listings of incoming and outgoing calls and in some cases the content of those calls. In some instances where there are valid legal requests for or orders for disclosure of Your information, we may notify You of the requests or orders and then it may be up to You to object or take specific action to prevent any disclosures pursuant to those requests or orders.
Where a governmental entity is seeking personally identifiable information of a Customer who subscribes to Charter's video services only or records revealing Customer's selection of video programming, the Cable Act requires a court order and that the video subscriber be afforded the opportunity to appear and contest in a court proceeding relevant to the court order any claims made in support of the court order. At such a proceeding, the Cable Act requires the governmental entity to offer clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the prosecution of the case. Except in certain situations (such as with respect to those who owe, or are owed, welfare or child support) state welfare agencies may obtain the names, addresses, and certain other Customer information as it appears in Charter's subscriber records under the authority of an administrative subpoena.
We may also use or disclose personally identifiable information about You without Your consent (a) to protect our Customers, employees, or property, (b) in emergency situations, (c) to enforce our rights in court or elsewhere, or directly with You, for violations of service terms, conditions or policies and/or (d) in order to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or as otherwise required by law, for example, as part of a regulatory proceeding.
Note to California Customers Regarding Your Privacy Rights:
California law requires Charter provide to certain Customers, upon request, certain information regarding the sharing of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As mentioned above, Charter does not share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. However, Charter may share personally identifiable information with some same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes (and, if a Charter telephone subscriber, then subject to the restrictions in the attached CPNI Policy). If You make a request by phone or on-line, Charter will provide You with the number of its same-branded affiliates in California and a list of personal information that it may have shared with some or all such affiliates.
Can I prohibit or limit Charter's use and disclosure of my personally identifiable information?
If You do not want Your name, address, level of service or other personally identifiable information disclosed to third parties in a "mailing list" as explained above, please register this preference at http://unsubscribe.charter.com or by contacting us by telephone at 1 888 GET CHARTER. Customers of our video service cannot opt-out of the collection of audience measurement data.
Also, if You do not want to receive marketing messages (e.g., phone calls, emails, and direct mail) from Charter, You may call 1-888-GET-CHARTER or visit http://unsubscribe.charter.com and make a request to have Your privacy preferences updated. Please note that such request will not eliminate all telephone calls, emails or direct mail sent to You from Charter as Charter may still continue to send non-marketing account-related messages to You.
How long does Charter maintain personally identifiable information?
Charter will maintain personally identifiable information about You as long as You are a subscriber to Charter's Service and as long as necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. If You are no longer a subscriber to any Charter Service and the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, Charter will only keep personally identifiable information as long as necessary to comply with laws governing our business. These laws include, but are not limited to, tax and accounting requirements that require record retention. Charter will also maintain personally identifiable information to satisfy pending requests for access by a subscriber to his/her information or pursuant to a court order. Charter will destroy Customers' personally identifiable information when the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, when there are no longer pending requests for such information, and when it is no longer necessary to retain the information under applicable laws.
How does Charter protect customer information?
Charter takes the security of our Customers' personally identifiable information seriously. Charter takes such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter to personally identifiable information. Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive personally identifiable information when it collects such information over the system. Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods. Charter limits access to databases containing Customers' personally identifiable information to those specifically authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the "Who sees the information collected by Charter?" section above. However, we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose personally identifiable information.
You need to help protect the privacy of Your own information. You and others who use Your equipment must not give identifying information to strangers or others whom You are not certain have a right or need to the information. You also must take precautions to protect the security of any personally identifiable information that You may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of Your personally identifiable information. You are responsible for the security of Your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks in Your home. For more information on things You can do to help protect the privacy of Your own information, visit www.charter.com/security or www.OnGuardOnline.gov .
Can I see the information that Charter collects about me?
You have a right under the Cable Act to see Your personally identifiable information that Charter collects and maintains. The information Charter has about its Customers is maintained at the local offices where service is provided, in our systems, and at our corporate headquarters. If You would like to see Your information, please send a written request to Your local Charter office. To find the location of Your local office please visit www.charter-business.com . Charter will be glad to make an appointment for You to come in to Your local office during regular business hours. If Your review reveals an error in our records, Charter will correct it. You may also be able to access certain information about You or Your account by telephone or online at www.charter-business.com , depending upon the information You have provided.
Does Charter protect children's privacy?Â 
Charter is concerned about children's privacy and does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 over its Service unless otherwise expressly identified. At those specific parts of our Service, Charter will provide a special notice or other information describing the additional privacy protections that may apply. Charter urges children to always obtain a parent or legal guardian's permission before sending any information about themselves over the Internet and urges parents and legal guardians to be vigilant regarding children's Internet usage. Other services or web pages accessed through Charter's Service may have different policies on collection of information pertaining to children and You should consult their privacy policies and read their notices if You have any concerns about the collection or use of such information by those entities.
How does Charter use cookies and web beacons?
A cookie is a small file that stores information in Your browser on Your computer. Charter places cookies in Your browser that contain some of the information You provide when You register with us and when You set up a personalized service or customize Your settings and preferences on our websites. Charter does not store highly sensitive personal information such as Your password, e-mail address or credit card number in cookies. Cookies enable Charter to summarize overall usage patterns for analysis. In addition, Charter uses cookies to provide personalized services such as saving Your astrological sign on Charter.net. Charter may also use cookies to provide a more useful online experience, such as allowing You to quickly enter a sweepstakes if You're already logged on.
A web beacon is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information about Your use of a given site. Like cookies, web beacons allow Charter and its technology providers to summarize overall usage patterns for our analysis and provide personalized services. Charter does not share or provide personally identifiable information we may collect, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers with our advertisers without Your express permission. However, Charter may provide site usage information linked to Your personally identifiable information to law enforcement or others in compliance with valid legal process or in other situations as stated in the "Who Sees the Information Collected by Charter?" paragraphs above.
You may opt-out of the cookies delivered by Charter on its websites by changing the setting on Your browser. Depending on Your privacy settings, please be aware that this may disable all cookies delivered to Your browser, not just the ones delivered by Charter.
Targeted Advertisements
Charter wants to make the advertisements it provides more relevant to You. Charter collects and uses non-personal information, such as information about your visits to our websites, ZIP Code, IP address and information from third parties. We may also combine that information with personally identifiable information, such as information You provide Charter and from Your Charter account. (See "What type of Information does Charter Collect"). In addition, Charter may partner with third-party advertising companies who may utilize cookies, web beacons, or other technology to deliver or facilitate the delivery of targeted advertisements.
Charter uses third-party advertising companies to identify and present tailored online advertisements for its goods and services and uses anonymous ZIP Codes to geographically target online advertisements for our other clients. Charter will not provide these online partners with access to Your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information without Your permission. When targeted online advertisements displayed on third-party websites are based on Your personally identifiable information or general location derived from your Charter IP address, You may opt-out by going to http://unsubscribe.charter.com and updating Your privacy preferences. After doing so, we recommend that You also remove any unwanted cookies from Your browser. For more information on how to adjust these settings go to Charter.com > Support > Internet Help.
Some of the advertisements You see on cable channels are placed by us. Some of those advertisements are placed in particular shows or channels; others are shown in particular geographic areas. Some of our cable advertisements will ask for Your permission to take certain actions, like mail You information or allow the advertiser to contact You; if You grant permission, we will use Your personal information for the permitted purposes only. In some areas we will be able to target cable advertisements to Your household that will be more relevant to Your interests based on information You provide us or information that we receive from third parties. When those cable advertisements are directed to You based on Your personal information, You can elect not to receive them. You may opt-out by going to http://unsubscribe.charter.com and updating Your privacy preferences.
If you change or get a new account, You will need to review all of Your opt-out choices.
What can I do if I believe Charter has violated my rights?
You may enforce the limitations imposed on us by federal law with respect to the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable subscriber information about You, through a civil action under federal law, in addition to other rights and remedies that may be available to You under federal or other applicable laws.
What if I have any questions?
If You have any questions about our privacy protections and policies, please contact Your local customer service office. You can find the phone number for Your local customer service office on Your monthly bill statement or by visiting Charter's website at www.charter-business.com .
IMPORTANT NOTE:
This Policy does not apply to Your use of any Charter website. You should review the privacy policy applicable to each site, which is available under the "Your Privacy Rights" or "Privacy Policy" section of each Charter website. This Policy also does not apply to those residential customers who subscribe to Charter's residential video programming, high-speed Internet and/or telephone service. The Residential Subscriber Privacy Policy is available under the "Your Privacy Rights" section of www.charter.com .
Effective: April 10, 2012
Charter Residential Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) Policy
The following CPNI Policy is in addition to requirements set forth in Charter's Commercial Subscriber Privacy Policy and is subject to some permitted uses and disclosures of Your name, address, and/or telephone number outlined in the Privacy Policy. The information that we have (1) relating to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of Your use of telephone service, and / or (2) contained on Your telephone bill concerning the telephone services that You receive is subject to additional privacy protections. That information, when matched to Your name, address, and telephone number is known as "Customer Proprietary Network Information," or CPNI for short. Examples of CPNI include information typically available from details on a customer's monthly telephone bill -- the type of line, technical characteristics, class of service, current telephone charges, long distance and local service billing records, directory assistance charges, usage data, and calling patterns. As a subscriber to our telephone services, You have the right, and Charter has a duty, under federal law to protect the confidentiality of CPNI. Charter offers many communications-related services, such as, for example, Charter Internet services. From time to time we would like to use the CPNI information we have on file to provide You with information about our communications-related products and services or special promotions. Our use of CPNI may also enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to Your specific needs. We would like Your approval so that we, our agents, affiliates, joint venture partners, and independent contractors may use this CPNI to let You know about communications-related services other than those to which You currently subscribe that we believe may be of interest to You. You do have the right to restrict this use of CPNI.
IIF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THIS NOTIFICATION, WE WILL ASSUME THAT YOU APPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED SERVICES. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISAPPROVE OUR USE OF YOUR CPNI, AND MAY DENY OR WITHDRAW OUR RIGHT TO USE YOUR CPNI AT ANY TIME BY CALLING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER REFLECTED ON YOUR MONTHLY BILLING STATEMENT OR 1-888-GET-CHARTER. We will also honor any restrictions applied by state law, to the extent applicable. Charter also offers various other services that are not related to the communications services to which You subscribe. Under the CPNI rules, some of those services, such as Charter video services, are considered to be non-communications related services. Occasionally, You may be asked during a telephone call with one of our representatives for Your oral consent to Charter's use of Your CPNI for the purpose of providing You with an offer for products or services not related to the telephone services to which You subscribe. If You provide Your oral consent for Charter to do so, Charter may use Your CPNI for the duration of such telephone call in order to offer You additional services. Any action that You take to deny or restrict approval to use Your CPNI will not affect our provision to You, now or in the future, of any service to which You subscribe. You may disregard this notice if You previously contacted us in response to a CPNI Notification and denied use of Your CPNI for the purposes described above. Any denial of approval for use of Your CPNI outside of the service to which You already subscribe is valid until such time as Your telephone services are discontinued or You affirmatively revoke or limit such approval or denial. The CPNI Policy above may be required by law to apply to our Voice over Internet Protocol, or, IP voice services.

Types of Information Collected
In order to provide this site and our numerous services, we collect two types of information on our site: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Â Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.
Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that identifies or can potentially be used to identify, contact or locate you. Â When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. Â It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities; however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, and other personally identifying information. Â When ordering products or services on the site, you may also be asked to provide payment information. Â Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. Â If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. This information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis. Â This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you go to next, demographic information, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Â A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. Â An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a network, such as the World Wide Web. Â An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Â Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
Collection Methods and Use of Information
We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you on this site unless you voluntarily provide it to us. Â You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you (a) register for our services and register your e-mail address with us; (b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c) sign up for special offers from us or from selected third parties; (d) send e-mail messages, submit forms, post to forums, or transmit other information by telephone, e-mail or letter; or (e) submit your payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our site. Â We may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.
In addition, we may also collect, or our third-party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Â Â We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and/or software, to administer our site, and to gather demographic information. Â Our third-party ad servers may also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our site.
We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to (a) to provide our services to you; (b) to allow us to properly maintain this site and our services and to make improvements or upgrades when necessary; (c) to provide you with technical support and for system maintenance; (d) to inform you of new products or services that may be of interest to you; (e) to respond to your inquiries or send administrative notices; (f) to prevent fraud, including the unauthorized use of this site or our services or violations of applicable policies and terms of service; or (g) to ensure our own compliance with the law. Â We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you, including any website terms of use or this Privacy Policy.
Release of Information
We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to unaffiliated third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you have affirmatively agreed to such disclosure. Â Charter may disclosure your Personally Identifiable Information with some of our same-branded affiliates for those affiliates' direct marketing purposes. Â We do provide some of our services or provide parts of this site through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, partners, and other third parties. Â We and our service partners may use your Personally Identifiable Information to deliver these services and to operate our site.
As part of our business activities, if we enter into a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information associated with the transaction.
Occasionally, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. Â We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, or when otherwise permitted by applicable law. Â We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use this site for illegal activities. Â We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
User Choices on Collection and Use of Information
If you do not wish to provide Personally Identifiable Information on this site, then you should not provide it when requested or otherwise provide your information to this site.Â  However, some parts of this site or our service may not function without the requested information.Â  We may, from time to time, send you marketing messages (e.g., email, direct mail, telephone calls, etc.) regarding our products and services. Â Â If you do not want to receive these marketing messages from Charter, please follow the opt-out instructions in the message or designate your Charter opt-out request by visiting unsubscribe.charter.com .Â  For more information about targeted marketing see below.
Security of Information
Charter takes the security of your Personally Identifiable Information seriously.Â  We take such actions as are reasonably necessary to prevent unauthorized access by entities other than Charter and its service providers to Personally Identifiable Information.Â  Charter uses security and/or encryption technology to secure certain sensitive Personally Identifiable Information when it collects such information over this site.Â  Charter restricts access to its customer database and secures the content by use of firewalls and other security methods.Â  Charter limits access to databases containing Personally Identifiable Information to authorized employees and agents of Charter and other parties identified in the use and release sections above.Â 
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

You need to help protect the privacy of your own information.Â  You should not give Personally Identifiable Information to strangers or others whom you are not certain have a right or need to the information.Â  You also must take precautions to protect the security of any Personally Identifiable Information that you may transmit by using encryption and other techniques to help prevent unauthorized parties from intercepting or receiving any of your Personally Identifiable Information.Â  You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks in your home or elsewhere.Â  Charter will never ask you to provide account sign-in passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information through unsolicited email messages.Â  If we request such information from you, we will always direct you to Charter's website, call you directly or ask that you give us a call.Â  You should, however, be aware of imposter websites pretending to be Charter's.Â  If you have receive an email requesting that you sign in or provide information that you suspect was not sent by Charter, DO NOT CLICK ON THE LINK IN THE EMAIL but use your own browser to go to Charter's site.Â  If you are directed to a website that you do not believe is Charter's, please forward the full email (with full Internet headers) to [emailÂ protected] .Â  Charter will also not ask for your Internet account password over the telephone.
Cookies

Â As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on your computer or utilize other means to collection Non-Personally Identifiable Information such as, web beacons, clear GIFs, pixel tags or other similar technologies. Â Â Â We and our third-party ad server will collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular ad to provide you with a smooth, efficient, customized and improved experience while using our site. Â Other unaffiliated advertisers may also place ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to them.
Targeted Marketing
Charter wants to make its advertisements for its goods and services more relevant to You.Â  Charter collects and uses non-personal information, such as information about your visits to our websites and IP address, and personally identifiable information, such as information You provide Charter and from Your Charter account (see "Types of Information Collected"), to identify and present such tailored advertisements for Charter's goods and services.Â  In addition, Charter may partner with a third-party advertising company who may utilize cookies, web beacons, or other technology to deliver or facilitate the delivery of targeted advertisements about Charter's goods and services on third-party websites. Â Charter will not provide this partner with access to Your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information.Â  When these targeted online advertisements are based on Your personally identifiable information and displayed on third-party websites, You may opt-out by going to http://unsubscribe.charter.com and requesting to have your privacy preferences updated.Â  After doing so, we recommend that You also remove any unwanted cookies from Your browser.Â  For more information on how to adjust these settings go to Charter.com > Support > Internet Help.
