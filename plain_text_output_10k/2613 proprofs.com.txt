Privacy Policy
At Mopro, your privacy is important to us. The following explains our privacy policy and our approach to the collection and use of information about you and/or your company.
Why Does Mopro Need Personal Information?
CML Media Corp. dba Mopro ("Company") has agreed to provide to Client the services set forth in the Customer Agreement (“Services”). All capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings set forth in the Customer Agreement. In the event of any conflict between any specific terms and conditions in the Customer Agreement and these Standard Terms and Conditions, the Customer Agreement shall control. The Customer Agreement and the Standard Terms and Conditions together shall constitute the “Agreement.”
What Type of Information Does Mopro Gather? How Does Mopro Gather This Information, and How Does Mopro Use It?
Mopro gathers two types of information about our website's users: Personal Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions, such as email and online registration forms to Mopro, and non-Personal Information that we collect automatically to observe site trends and gain a better understanding of our users' experiences.
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, your name, home address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card information such as the credit card number, card verification value, and the billing address. The types and amount of Personal Information collected for these activities will vary depending on the activity.
Other information we gather includes aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This non-Personal Information also covers things like click-throughs, IP addresses, and usage data, and it may at times be combined with your Personal Information. All of this allows us to better tailor our content to our users' individual needs.
Personal Information Collection and Use
Mopro only collects Personal Information that we consider necessary for providing you with the world class service you expect as a Mopro client. In general, you can check out various pages on our websites without telling us who you are or revealing any identifying Personal Information. If you'd like to view the entire site or sign up for any of our services, we may require differing degrees of Personal Information about you, your company and its goals, credit, billing, financial information, and various other types of information. This Personal Information is critical to us in developing services that help you achieve your business objectives, and we may use it to communicate with you about your account or our services.
If you communicate with us through e-mail, regular mail, or the phone, or choose to leave feedback on any of our websites, we may also save that information and use it to improve our customer support and client services, to troubleshoot other problems or resolve disputes, or for other business purposes. If you are referred to us from another company or website, we may receive certain additional information about you from that entity. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to send you special offers or information from our trusted business partners. You may choose to not receive these offers by opting out when you first receive such an offer.
Non-Personal Information Collection and Use
Like most websites, though, we automatically receive and record certain information through the use of various technologies like "cookies," "web beacons," and "pixel tags." We use this information to observe trends and site traffic, administer our sites and improve their usability, and to gain a better understanding of your interests. This information may include, by way of example, the URL from which you just came, the URL to which you next go, your computer browser information, operating system, IP address, and other information about how you use our site.
To Whom, and When, Might Mopro Disclose My Personal Information?
Our Affiliates, Vendors and Service Providers
We may share Personal Information with our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing Personal Information on our behalf, or performing other business services for us. We ask that all of our service providers use at least the same degree of care in protecting Personal Information as we do, and we provide them with information only to the extent necessary to assist us.
Aggregate Information
We may aggregate Personal Information, and disclose such information to third parties for a variety of reasons, including for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do this, we will not disclose information in a manner that directly identifies you.
Other Third Parties
We will not share Personal Information collected on this web site with third parties for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. In addition, Mopro does not otherwise share Personal Information about site users with third parties unless doing so is appropriate to carry out a user's request or it reasonably believes that doing so is legally required or is in Mopro's interest to protect its property or other legal rights or the rights or property of others, or necessary for national security, other law enforcement, issues of public importance or safety, or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies.
Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy
If Mopro should ever file for bankruptcy or have its assets sold to or merge with another entity, information Mopro receives from you from this site is a Mopro asset and may be transferred.
How Does Mopro Protect My Personal Information?
Mopro uses reasonable procedural and technical safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss, theft or misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
