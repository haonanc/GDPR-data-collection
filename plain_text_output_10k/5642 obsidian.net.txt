What's New
Thank you for visiting Obsidian's Privacy Policy. We've updated this policy on November 28, 2017. A quick summary of the changes:
We've updated and reorganized our Privacy Policy to better explain how we collect information and use it.
We've added more detail on Cookies and Tracking Technologies and how they are used on our website and in our games.
We've added California's Privacy Rights information.
We still do not and will not sell your data to any third parties. It remains one of our core commitments      to you, our fans and customers, to protect the information you provide us, to use it only to improve our      games and services, and to deliver any rewards or purchases made on our websites.
Obsidian Entertainment, Inc. (“Obsidian”) respects the privacy concerns of the users of its web site, www.obsidian.net (the “Site”), and its games. Obsidian provides this      privacy statement to explain what information is gathered during a visit to the Site or playing our     games, and how such information may be used.
Please also review the Terms of Use which also      governs your use of this Site.
What We Collect
Personally Identifiable Information
Websites, Forums, Backer Portal
Obsidian collects names, e-mails, and birthdates from users who register accounts on our websites      and forums. Only the user's e-mail and birthdate are required for account access. We ask for      birthdates to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA") .
Crowdfunding information such as names, e-mails, and shipping addresses are collected by our backer      portal websites and then shared and stored by Obsidian in its efforts to deliver any rewards as part      of its crowdfunding efforts, or to ship any products or services purchased through our websites. We      may share this information with third parties who we use to handle fulfillment.
Our Games
We've added telemetry to some of our games. We use this information to help us better understand how      our players play our games and to use the information to help us improve them through patches, DLC,      or other future iterations. Telemetry is not required to play our games and can be turned off at any      time within the game.
As a general policy, we do not collect personally identifiable information with in-game telemetry,      such as your name, address, or e-mail address. The only pieces of personally identifiable information      we collect is your public Steam or GOG user ID, and IP address. We use this information to help us      associate game data (such as where a player may have died, or what dialog choices were made) in a way      that lets us see how users start, play, and finish our games.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
When you visit our websites or forums, your browser sends information such as browser type and      version, and OS type and version to our web servers. We use this information to make sure our      websites work adequately with the browsers and OSs our users use.
Gameplay data from playing our games can also be opted out within the game options     (assuming the telemetry system used is Obsidian's – it is possible that one of our      publishing partners may use their own telemetry system in one of our games, and their privacy      policy applies in those cases). The following items are types of information collected     by our telemetry:
Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software, such as IP          address or other identifier information about the device (such as make and model),          information about the device's operating system and browser, or other device or          system-related specifications.
Usage information and statistics about how you interact with our games, such as how long a         game session is, what kind of character you created, where one of your character's may          have died, when they looted a chest, or how you answered dialog choices.
The physical location of your play session, such as may be derived from your IP address.
How We Use This Information
The data we collect after users opt-in are used to identify areas for improvement for our      websites and games. We use backer information to notify our backers on our progress of specific     products they may have donated toward. We also use their shipping addresses (if applicable) to      fulfill backer rewards. This information may be shared with third parties, such as our game's      publisher, and any production and shipping facilities required in order to fulfill physical      rewards.
Requests for Information
The Site's forums, various mailing lists, downloads, special offers, contests, registration      forms, and surveys may request that you give us contact information such as your name, mailing     and/or e-mail address; demographic information such as your age and gender; and personal      preference information such as your tastes in video game platforms and gameplay. Information     submitted at the time of submission will be used by Obsidian only as necessary for our      legitimate business interests, including without limitation the improvement of our products,     services, and contents of the Site. Obsidian may also share such aggregated information with     our business and promotional partners to further those interests.
Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties. With your permission, we may use your contact information to send you information about our      company and its products. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings through our      website or by contacting us at
.
Obsidian may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that      disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against      someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally)     with Obsidian's rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be      harmed by such activities.
Children Under the Age of 13
Obsidian recognizes the special obligation to protect personally identifiable information      obtained from children under age 13. AS SUCH, IF YOU ARE 12 YEARS OLD OR YOUNGER,      OBSIDIAN REQUESTS THAT YOU NOT SUBMIT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE SITE OR TO OBSIDIAN. If Obsidian discovers that a child age 12 or younger has provided us with personally      identifiable information, we will delete that child's personally identifiable information from     our records.
Use of Cookies
We use "cookies" on our websites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a website visitor's      hard drive to help the website improve access, identify repeat visitors to the website, and      carry information provided by the user throughout the Site. For example, when you log in to      our website with your username and password, a cookie is saved so that every time you access      a page on our site while you visit it, you do not need to enter your username and password      each time. Another example of how a cookie is used is when you browse a store. If you add items     to a cart and then go to another page on the site, the items stay in the cart; this is because     the cookie saves this information and transmits it back to the website each time a new page is     visited.
Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience     on our websites and provide support for the internal operations of the websites or some of our     online services, including games. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally      identifiable information on our website, other than to be used to signify that you are logged     in to the site (with the example above of not needing to repeatedly enter your username and      password on each page view).
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can, however, set your browser to      refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please consult the technical      information relevant to your browser for instructions. If you choose to disable your cookies      setting or refuse to accept a cookie, some or all parts of our Site may not function properly      or may be considerably slower.
Examples of Cookies Used
Obsidian uses the following cookies on its Site:
Google Analytics (name __ga, __gat-IA*): These cookies are used to collect      information about how visitors use the Site and what kind of browsers they are using to browse     the site. These cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of      visitors to the Site, where visitors have come to the Site from, and the pages they visited     while browsing. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, visit Google’s Analytics Opt Out page .
Session token (name: sessionid): This is a general-purpose identifier used to     maintain the user session and any variables (such as your login session and what items may be     in your cart; see examples above).
CSRF (name: csrftoken): Cross Site Request Forgery cookies are used as a      security measure to prevent malicious websites, users, or programs from using your user      credentials to perform unwanted actions on our website.
Messages: Occasionally, we may provide messages to specific users and use      cookies to track when that user may have read the message (so it isn't displayed again, for example).
Other Tracking Technologies
We may also use other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, or other web      programming code from time to time. Such technologies may be invisible to you, but any      electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web     beacon. Such technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation,     to count visitors to a service, such as how many people viewed a newsletter; to monitor how      users navigate the service; to count how many e-mails were actually opened or to count how many     particular articles or links were actually viewed. Such technologies may also enable us to send     e-mail messages in a format users can read, tell us whether e-mail has been opened, and      ultimately allow us to reduce or eliminate messages sent to users. We treat information      collected by or from such technologies as non-personal information. To the extent that IP      addresses or similar identifiers may be considered personal information by local law, however,     we treat such information as personal information. To the extent that non-personal information     may also be combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal      information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
