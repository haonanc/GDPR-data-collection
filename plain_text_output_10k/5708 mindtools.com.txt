We will not contact you about other products and services we offer.

Advertising and Analytics
When you use our website, we or a third party partner may serve you advertisements that may be of interest to         you. These advertisements are based on information relating to your access to, and use of, our website and other         websites. If you would like more general information about these practices, click here
We use the Facebook pixel in order to understand the types of people that visit our website and show you relevant         advertisements for things you may have looked at on our website. You can find out more about the Facebook Pixel here , including how to adjust your preferences with             Facebook.

How we build our audience profile through Social Media platforms
We work with social and business media platforms including Facebook and LinkedIn to bring you targeted         advertising about our products and services and improve your experience on our website. To do this, we provide         them with a list of email addresses and they confirm if they operate accounts with those email addresses. This         enables us to provide relevant advertising on each platform to those accounts and to build an audience profile         to help our adverts reach other people on each platform who may be interested in our products and services.
If the platform does not have an account with a matching email address, the contract terms under which they act         as our processor for this purpose does not permit them to make any further use of the email address we         provided.
We believe we have a legitimate interest in customising our social media communications in this way and that         there is minimal impact on your privacy. Nevertheless, you can always tell us not to share your information with         Facebook, LinkedIn or any other platform by notifying us at privacy@mindtools.com .         Alternatively, if you have an account on any platform, you can set your preferences via your platform account.
