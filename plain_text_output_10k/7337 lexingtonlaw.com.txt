Your privacy is important to Lexington Law Firm ("Lexington"). Please read our Privacy                             Policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your                             information. By visiting Lexington's website or agreeing to content that includes a link to                             this document ("Online Ads"), you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy                             and our Terms of Use .
1. Our Collection and Use of Personal Information
Personal Information is information you provide us that can be used to uniquely identify or                             contact a single person, such as your name, email address, phone numbers and tax                             identification number.
You may be asked to provide Personal Information when you interact with Lexington, Online                             Ads, or one of Lexington's related companies, such as in connection with a completed or                             abandoned transaction or a request for information from Lexington. Lexington and its related                             companies may share your Personal Information with each other and use it consistent with                             this Privacy Policy.
Lexington may supplement the Personal Information you provide with Personal Information                             available from other sources, such as public databases, data aggregators, and other                             commercially available sources.
2. Examples of Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It
You may provide Lexington a variety of Personal Information, including your name, mailing                             address, email address, phone number, payment information, and tax identification number.
The Personal Information we collect allows us to deliver requested products, services and                             information to you, to stay in contact with you, and to manage Lexington's relationship with                             you. By providing Lexington with Personal Information, you consent to Lexington's transfer                             and storage of that information.
Lexington also may use your Personal Information for research, development, and analysis,                             and for advertising, marketing, product and service offerings, security, fraud prevention,                             and other business activities.
Our Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
Non-Personal Information is information in a form that does not allow for direct association                             with a specific person. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an                             aggregated basis. We may collect, use, monitor, analyze, transfer, and disclose Non-Personal                             Information for any purpose.
4. Examples of Non-Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It
We may collect and aggregate information regarding user access, activity and behavior on our                             website, such as when you visit the website and what content is of interest or seems to be                             most useful to you. If we combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the                             combined information is treated as Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Non-Personal Information includes:

Cookies and Other Technologies - We use a variety of technologies to collect and store                             information when you visit our website. This technology may involve sending web beacons and                             cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device.
We use Cookies and Other Technologies to analyze your behavior when accessing our website and to deliver ads to you that relate to your interests.

We use Click-Through URLs to help us determine interest in a particular topic and to measure                             the effectiveness of our email communications.
Anonymized Information - If we separate Non-Personal Information from Personal Information,                             the separated information is treated as Non-Personal Information for purposes of this                             Privacy Policy.
5. Our Sharing of Information with Others
Personal Information
We do not share Personal Information with businesses or individuals outside of Lexington,                             except under the following circumstances:

For                             example, we may use others to:

process financial transactions and perform accounting functions
advertise, market, or make product or service offerings
Legal Reasons - We will share Personal Information with others outside of Lexington if we                             have a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to:

protect our operations or customers
detect, investigate, or address fraud, security, or technical problems

Non-Personal Information
We may share Non-Personal Information publicly and with our strategic partners. For example,                             we may share Non-Personal Information to describe the size and success of our firm.
6. Transparency and Choice
Lexington may use third-party display advertising companies, including Google, to serve                             Lexington ads on its behalf on sites across the Internet. Lexington and its display                             advertisers use cookies to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to                             Lexington's website.
You may find additional information, opt-out of, or otherwise customize display advertising                             from Google or DoubleClick by visiting Google's Ads Preference Manager .
You may find additional information and opt-out of other participating third-party display                             advertising by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out                             page .
Lexington may use third-party analytics companies, including Google Analytics and Omniture                             to analyze and understand user behavior when visiting our website.
You may find additional information and opt-out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out                             browser add-on .

You also may want to consider disabling cookies within your browser. Please note, however,                             that certain features of the Lexington website will not function properly or be available                             once cookies are disabled.
7. Social Media Plug-ins
Plug-ins for social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo, Windows and Google                             plus (among others), are integrated on Lexington's website.
By interacting with us through a social media plug-in, certain information will be                             transmitted to the related social network, and you permit us to have on-going access to                             information from your social network profile.
If you do not want the social network to collect information about you, or to share it with                             Lexington and other third parties, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social                             network and/or log out of the relevant social network before you visit Lexington's site.
8. Information Security and Retention
Lexington takes precautions to safeguard your Personal Information from loss, theft, and                             misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These                             precautions include technical, physical, and managerial procedures.
Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request                             that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services.
We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy and enforce safeguards within the                             company.
We are committed to working with appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any                             complaints regarding the transfer of Personal Information that we cannot resolve with our                             customers directly.
Lexington uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all pages where Personal Information                             is collected. This protects the confidentiality of your Personal Information while it is                             transmitted over the Internet.
For your own protection, you should exercise care with the information you share over the                             Internet. You should always use a secure browser and exercise good judgment in using                             passwords, such as using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, special                             characters, and you should avoid using the same or similar passwords across multiple sites.
Clients may access their Personal Information by logging into their account. We make                             good-faith efforts to give you ways to update or to delete your Personal Information                             quickly, unless we need to keep that information for a legitimate business or legal purpose.                             Some changes require personal contact with an assigned Lexington representative.
Lexington retains Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for the time necessary                             and reasonable to fulfill the purposes outlined in the Privacy Policy, unless a longer                             retention period is required or permitted by law.
We may reject requests to change or delete information that are unreasonably repetitive,                             require disproportionate technical effort (for example, requiring the development of new                             systems or fundamental changes to existing systems), risk the privacy of others, or would be                             extremely impractical (such as information stored on backups).
We work to protect data from accidental or malicious destruction. Accordingly, we may not                             immediately delete or change residual copies and we may not delete or change information                             from our backup systems. Unless a disproportionate effort is required, we will provide                             information access and correction without charge.
9. Third Party Privacy Policies
This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from                             you. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lexington does not own or                             control or to people that Lexington does not employ or manage. Lexington does not control                             the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those                             third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your                             personal information to others. For more information about each such third party, please                             refer to the third party's privacy policy.
If you provided your information on the website of an entity not related to Lexington, and                             that entity shared your information with us, the privacy policy of that website governs the                             non-related entity's use of your information, which may be different from this policy.
10. Children
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we                             have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete                             the Personal Information as soon as possible.
11. Consumer Surveys
Lexington may invite you to join a survey panel through which you will be able to share your                             opinions about proposed new services or other issues relevant to Lexington and its practice.                             Your participation in this panel is voluntary and is not required in order to engage                             Lexington’s legal services. Opting in also does not affect your ongoing legal services. If                             you are invited to join a survey panel, your input may be sought in order to assist                             Lexington to better market its legal services to interested consumers and provide more                             efficient and effective services overall. You agree that Lexington, including its third                             party providers, can use (as it chooses and at its sole discretion) any information and                             feedback you provide in response to survey and panel questions. You acknowledge and agree                             that Lexington will be the sole owner of the services and survey questions about which you                             provide information and feedback and that you have no claim to any Lexington services or the                             revenue or profits derived from them. You hereby assign to Lexington all intellectual                             property rights embodied in the information and feedback you provide to Lexington (about the                             services and in response to the survey questions) and shall execute any documents necessary                             to effect the foregoing. All information and feedback you provide to Lexington as part of                             the panel is the confidential business proprietary information of Lexington and you shall                             not disclose such information and feedback to anyone other than the designated individuals                             at Lexington responsible for the services and/or survey(s). You warrant and represent that                             your participation on the panel will not violate the rights of any person or entity and will                             not cause liability for payment to any entity or person.
If you participate, you will be awarded points based on your completing surveys and                             otherwise engaging in the panel. You acknowledge and agree that you understand that any                             points or awards provided are solely for completing surveys and otherwise participating in                             the panel. It is within Lexington’s sole discretion to decide what award to provide and the                             points that will be required for an award. The award system may be changed at Lexington’s                             discretion, but if a panel participant has met the minimum requirement for an award, that                             award will be provided to the individual before applying a new incentive structure.
Because your participation in the panel is not required for your Lexington services, you may                             opt out of the panel at any time without terminating your Lexington representation.                             Similarly, you may continue serving on the panel even if your Lexington representation ends.                             You will need to opt out of the panel in order to no longer receive emails or informational                             material about the panel surveys unless participation is terminated by Lexington.
Lexington reserves the right to terminate your participation in the panel at any time. Some                             of the reasons your enrollment in the panel may be terminated include, but are not limited                             to, inactivity from all panel activities for a period of time or offensive conduct toward                             Lexington, its employees, contractors, or agents, or toward fellow panel members. If                             Lexington terminates your participation or if you voluntarily cancel your participation, you                             will receive the appropriate award for all points you have accrued to date if those points                             have accumulated to the minimum required for any award; otherwise, all points will be                             forfeited.
As a member of the panel, you will receive e-mails and other material from our third party                             provider(s) and you may be asked additional information about yourself. The personally                             identifying information you provide Lexington and third party provider(s) will be treated as                             set forth in this Privacy Policy. Under no circumstances will Lexington share with its third                             party provider(s) information about your client case unless you provide specific, written                             authorization to do so.
You also acknowledge and understand that information you provide as part of the panel will                             be kept on the platform provided by Lexington’s third party provider(s). This type of                             information may include answers you have given as part of the panel registration process and                             substantive answers you have given in surveys.
12. Privacy Policy Changes and Questions
Lexington may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Policy                             will be posted on Lexington's website, with a corresponding revision date. Please check the                             website and Online Ads each time you use them for the most current information and to ensure                             that you are aware of any updates.
