We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and Services, to analyze how users utilize the Services, and as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Notice. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties, as described in section 4.
It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Personal Information changes during your relationship with us.
2.a. Information You Provide to Us
Account information: We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for a subscription or make purchases through the Services. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, browser information, and, in some cases, billing information, company name, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you accept that some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Notice. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that anonymous information to our partners.
Content you provide through our features: We collect and store content that you post, send, receive and share while using our Services’ features. This content includes any information about you that you may choose to provide. Examples of content we collect and store include: The comments you write, the product Collections you create, the messages, files and links you send to other users via our messaging feature.
Content you provide through our websites: We collect other content that you submit to websites owned or operated by us, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions or events.
Information you provide through our support channels: The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with the Services. Whether you contact our support via email, social media or support chat, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you may be asked to provide contact information, a description of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.
Payment information: We collect payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to provide payment information, such as billing address and payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.
Information needed to verify user identity for paying out the earnings: This type of information collection is limited to the users who earn money through the Services, either by selling their artwork or by participating in Iconfinder’s referral program (Earner). Before making the first payout to the Earner, we ask to provide the personal identification document to verify the identity of the Earner. We may store this Personal Information for a reasonable amount of time needed to process the verification. We delete the personal identification document within a reasonable amount of time after the verification is completed. When verifying Earners, we may ask for additional information, such as links to social media accounts or examples of work in progress to verify that contributing artists are selling their original artwork.

For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally directly or indirectly.

6. Information processing and transfers for EEA individuals
Legal bases for processing (for EEA individuals)
As an individual in the EEA (European Economic Area), we collect and process information about you where we have legal bases for doing so under EU laws. We only collect and use the information when:
We need it to provide you the Services, including operating the Services, provide customer support and personalize features as well as for safety and security processes.
It serves a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, for marketing and promotion and to protect our legal rights and interests.
You have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
We need the information to comply with legal obligations.
If you have given consent to our use of your information for a specific purpose, you can change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. You have the right to object to the use of your information, but this may mean that the Services are no longer available.
7. International transfers of information
Our third-party service providers may be located outside EEA which means their processing of Personal Information will involve transferring of data outside the EEA. When data is transferred outside EEA we ensure protection using the following safeguards:
We only transfer Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of Personal Information by European Commission. Please see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en
Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.
