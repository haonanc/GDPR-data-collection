Personally Identifying Information.
"Personally Identifying Information" is information that individually identifies you,  such as your name, company name, physical address, phone numbers, email address and any other  information that would allow someone to identify or contact you.

Of course, you may  choose not to provide Round Table Pizza with PII; however, if you choose not to provide  the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the  Website. Our server does not automatically record PII.  Such information can become known to Round Table Pizza via its Website only when  you voluntarily submit it.

In the case of such event,  the PII will become the property of the successor and will be subject to the successor's Privacy Policy should they have one.
Service Providers

For example purposes only,  Round Table Pizza may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services such  as hosting and maintenance, payment processing and certain marketing and promotions functions.  We only provide the Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform their services on our behalf.

How does Round Table Pizza protect your PII?
Round Table Pizza protects your PII by using safeguards that are appropriate to the  sensitivity of the information. Each of our employees with access to your PII is  informed about our Privacy Policy and procedures for protecting PII.  Round Table Pizza undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of  the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about  individual Registrants and, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy,  will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside Round Table Pizza.
You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your user name and password  are confidential and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone.   Unfortunately, neither Round Table Pizza’s network nor data transmission over the  Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect  Registrant's information, Round Table Pizza cannot ensure or warrant the security of member information.  Thus, any information a Registrant transmits to us is done so at the Registrant's own risk.  Once we receive Registrant information, we undertake substantial efforts to protect the  confidentiality of this information consistent with this  Privacy Policy.
Round Table Pizza may store and process PII collected on the Website on its own servers  or on the servers of its Service Providers (defined below). Paper copies containing all  or part of the PII you supply to us may be made and kept in file cabinets as part of the  course of normal business activity. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy,  and ensure the correct use of information, we have implemented physical, electronic,  and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.  Although we take security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,  disclosure or destruction of data, Round Table Pizza does not guarantee that unauthorized third  parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of PII. In the event of a  security breach whereby your PII is acquired by an unauthorized person, Round Table Pizza will  take commercially reasonable steps to contain the breach and to notify you of the unauthorized acquisition.
Children’s Privacy
Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us.  The Website is intended for users who are 18 years old or older.  We do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we  have inadvertently received PII from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information  from our records. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s  Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to  provide PII without parental consent. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13  has provided PII, please contact us, and we will take appropriate action.
