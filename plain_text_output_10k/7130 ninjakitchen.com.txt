Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy
SharkNinja Operating LLC is committed to ensuring your privacy on the Internet by adhering to high standards of fairness and integrity. We are committed to keeping our customers informed about how we use the information we gather from you through the use of each of our websites (collectively, the “Websites”) and by email, on our social media pages, our products and our related mobile applications (collectively with the Websites, the “Media”). Our Policy is developed from principles established by the Federal Trade Commission, the Direct Marketing Association and other local applicable legislation regarding information collected via the Internet (collectively, the “Applicable Privacy Legislation”). The Policy also provides you the ability to “opt-out” of providing personal information that you do not wish to provide and to access, change or remove any personal information already collected.  We will not collect, use or disclose your personal information other than in compliance with the Policy.
What Personally Identifiable Information do the SharkNinja Operating LLC Websites collect from me?
You do not have to provide personal information to gain access to or browse any of our Websites. We require registering users of our Websites and owners registering their products online to provide us with a name, telephone number, email address (if they have one), postal address and zip code. We may also ask for additional information to assist us with our development of new products.
If you purchase a product through any of the Websites we will require you to provide us with the above information plus your payment or other financial account information and delivery details. If you send us email messages, you will automatically provide us with your electronic mail address, as well as any other personally identifiable information you include in the text of your message.
We or companies acting on our behalf may collect and store from all visitors to the Websites, whether they actively provide us with information or merely browse the Websites, the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer they are using, the browser software they use and their operating system, the date and time they access the Websites, the Internet address of the website from which they linked directly to the Websites, and other similar information. We use this type of information to track website usage, to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of the Websites and to help us make the Websites more useful. This tracking information may be collected and compiled by third parties in the aggregate on our behalf and made available to third parties primarily to identify demographic data regarding our customers.  Like most Internet websites, we use "cookie" technology to obtain non-personal information from online visitors to the Websites. 
What are cookies and how does SharkNinja Operating LLC use them?
A “cookie" is a small text file that is sent to your web browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The information collected using “cookies” may include your IP address, the address of the web page that referred you to our Website, dates and times of Website visits and the location of your device. The Websites use "cookies" as a means of compiling information detailing the usage of our site. These findings help us understand our customer's needs so that we may improve your browsing/shopping experience at the Websites. Including other uses not listed below, generally we may use "cookies" to:
1. Estimate the number of users of the Websites.
2. Quantify general usage of the Websites.
3. Track aggregate traffic patterns.
4. Assist in the personalization and general improvement of your experience at the Websites.
Personal information cannot be extracted by simply placing a "cookie" on an individual's computer. If you have submitted personal information to the Websites, then the aggregated data may be combined with some personal information for internal marketing and reporting purposes. Even though most Web browsers accept "cookies," most browsers also give you the option to reject "cookies". Please note that if you set your browser to reject "cookies" you will still be able to visit the Websites but your shopping and browsing experience may be somewhat affected. 
Composite tracking information generated by cookies may be shared with third parties for the purpose of documenting Websites activity, traffic accounting, content analysis and other trends. Statistical information is not linked to any personal information and cannot identify any individual user of the Websites.
What Personally Identifiable Information does the SharkNinja Operating LLC products and apps collect from me?
Some of our products are equipped with smart technology, are Internet-enabled, or may be operated through a SharkNinja app, each of which may allow the product to transmit data wirelessly to SharkNinja.  We may collect function and use statistics, such as battery life and health, number of missions, the device identifier, and/or Internet protocol (IP), etc.  When you register your product with a SharkNinja app, the app may collect and maintain information about the product and app usage, feature usage, in-app transactions, technical specifications, crashes, and other information about how you use your smart product and/or the app.
We use this information to collect and analyze statistics and usage data, perform aggregate data analyses, diagnose and fix technology problems, enhance device performance, improve user experience, and to provide maintenance notices to customers. We may use this information to provide you with personalized communications, including marketing and promotional messages, such as emails providing product order information when your device indicates a battery is low or may need replacement, for example.  Our smart products do not transmit this information unless you register your device online, consent to the use of such information and connect to WiFi or connect to the Internet via another method.  It is possible to use our smart products without WiFi transmission simply by disconnecting your WiFi from the device or by never connecting it at all.

Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, app and product usage patterns, and registration data to improve product design and experience and to provide other services relating to the way SharkNinja Apps and products are used. Google will not associate IP addresses with any other data held by Google. To stop data from being collected by Google Analytics, you can stop accepting cookies by making changes to your browser or device cookie settings.  However, you may not be able to use all features of the Media in full when cookies are disabled.

Online Behavioral Advertising
We may have relationships with carefully selected and monitored partners, including ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) who may serve ads on behalf of us and others on non-affiliated sites and may set cookies during your visit to be used for remarketing purposes. They may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your visits to the Websites and elsewhere over time.
