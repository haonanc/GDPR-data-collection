Information Collected When You Visit Our Web site and How We Use It
Macy’s, Inc. only collects personal information that you voluntarily submit to this site, and we use that information for the purpose for which it was submitted. The following are examples of the types of personal information that are collected and how they are used:
If you submit a resume for a job posted on our site, that resume will be forwarded to the appropriate subsidiary for review and response. “Applicant Profiles” may be submitted through the “Search Jobs/Apply Now!” online employment center forms available on the www.macysjobs.com web site. However, please do not include sensitive data, such as a social security number, driver’s license number, or government issued identification number or account number, when submitting an online application, resume or cover letter. Applicant profiles are kept in our database for future reference so we can continue to consider you for additional positions. All of Macy’s, Inc.’s subsidiaries share equally in the access of our database and you may be contacted by a division other than the one to which you originally submitted an applicant profile, or for a position other than one for which you originally submitted an applicant profile. To be removed from the Macy’s, Inc. database so future e-mail correspondence regarding employment opportunities will not be sent to you, e-mail your name (first and last), along with your e-mail address to the following link:  macysjobs@macys.com . Please specify in your e-mail that you are requesting to be removed from the Macy’s, Inc. database. Note: Submitted applicant profiles are considered by Macy’s, Inc. to be a submission of position interest and not a legal application.
If you submit a comment about us or one of our subsidiaries through our “Got Questions” form on the college section of the web site, we will use your information to review and respond to your comment or question. In doing so, we may forward the information you provide to one of our subsidiaries. For example, if you submit a comment about Bloomingdale’s, we may provide that information to Bloomingdale’s so that they may review and, as appropriate, respond to it.
If you ask to be added to the mailing list for any of our subsidiaries (e.g., you want to receive macys.com catalogs), we will provide your information to that subsidiary, and you will be added to its marketing list. In that case, please note that your information may be shared with other Macy’s, Inc. affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes.
With the exception noted above, we do not use the information you submit to this site for marketing purposes, and we do not share it with any unaffiliated third parties. If you have any questions about our privacy practices and the choices you have regarding the use of your personal information for marketing purposes, you may call our Customer Service Privacy Hotline at 888-529-2254.
