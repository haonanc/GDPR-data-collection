Kamala Harris joined 35 attorneys general objecting to a new privacy policy that Google plans to roll out next week.        The National Assn. of Attorneys General says the new policy invades consumer privacy by automatically sharing with all Google services personal information that users give to just one service.        “The new policy forces consumers to allow information across all of Google's products to be shared without giving them the proper ability to opt out,” the association said in a letter to Google Chief Executive Larry Page.

SAN FRANCISCO -- After a lengthy delay and under growing pressure from regulators and lawmakers, Facebook moved forward with updates to its privacy policy on Friday but deleted a controversial sentence that claimed any teen using the service was assumed to have gotten permission from a parent or guardian for his or her name, image and information to be used in advertising on the service.     The giant social network insisted that it was not changing its policies, merely clarifying language in them, and that it already has permission from its users - - including teens - - to use their personal data in ads.     But the decision to remove the sentence came amid scrutiny on Capitol Hill of how Internet companies track and target teens.

Google rolled out its new privacy policy Thursday to renewed protests from data protection authorities in Europe.      Those authorities have concluded that the new policy violates European law, European Union Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding told BBC Radio Four.      France's data protection authority has taken the lead in probing the new policy.      “They have come to the conclusion that they are deeply concerned, and that the new rules are not in accordance with the European law, and that the transparency rules have not been applied," Reding said,    according to Reuters   .      “We are confident that our new simple, clear and transparent privacy policy respects all European data protection laws and principles,” a Google spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

Fewer people are living in middle class neighborhoods in America as people increasingly dwell in areas segregated by income extremes.     American families are moving to areas that are focused more exclusively on either the wealthy or the poor, a trend that could exacerbate the growing income divide, according to a study by professors at Cornell University and Stanford University.     The study called this trend "income segregation. "         MOST DANGEROUS JOBS: 10 professions with the highest fatalities in America         Compared with 1970, when 65% of American families lived in middle income areas, only about 42% of families lived in those areas in 2009, the study concluded.

Google is rebutting charges that its new privacy policy violates a settlement it struck with federal regulators last year.      The Internet search giant told the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that its policy complies with the settlement, according to a self-assessment report the company handed over in January.      The report,    obtained by Politico    Friday, says Google has gone to “exceptional lengths” to tell its users what data it harvests and what it does with it.      Google settled charges last year that it violated privacy laws by exposing Gmail users' personal information when rolling out its now-defunct Google Buzz social networking service.

A privacy watchdog has filed a federal lawsuit against the Federal Trade Commission in a bid to stop Google from rolling out its new privacy policy.       In an unusual legal maneuver, the Electronic Privacy Information Center is asking a federal judge to issue a temporary restraining order and injunction that would require the FTC to enforce the consent order it reached with Google last year.       Google settled with the FTC on charges that it deceived users and violated its own privacy policy when it launched the now defunct Buzz social network.

SAN FRANCISCO - Parents take note: Your teens can now post status updates and photos on Facebook for anyone to see.     The giant social network on Wednesday lifted restrictions on kids ages 13 to 17 that kept them from sharing information with people they do not know. Until now, teens' posts on Facebook could be viewed only by friends and the friends of their friends.     The move presents a tough new challenge to parents trying to keep their kids safe on social media.     Facebook said it was bringing its privacy policy in line with competitors' by giving teens the freedom to decide whether they want to express themselves among a close circle of friends or with a bullhorn.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A coalition of more than 20 public health, youth and consumer groups that advocate for the health and welfare of teens are raising concerns about the potential negative effects of proposed changes to Facebook's privacy policy and are calling on the Federal Trade Commission to block the changes.

In a challenge to how Google Inc. treats users' personal information, European regulators have   asked the search giant   to make changes to what it discloses to users about what it does with the data and how long it keeps it.     France's data-protection agency led the European investigation into the privacy policy that Google adopted earlier this year. It consolidated dozens of privacy policies for its various services including the video-sharing site YouTube, making it easier for Google to target advertising.
