Email Newsletters and “Send a Friend” Feature
After signing up online, users will receive email newsletters and other occasional announcements from AlterNet. In order to distribute our email, we collect subscribers’ email addresses.

AlterNet offers a “send this story to a friend” feature, which allows our users to inform others about an article they might be interested in. For this feature to function, we ask for email addresses from the sender and for the recipient. We do not store or save these addresses and you will not receive any communication from AlterNet or its partners as a result of having used this feature.
