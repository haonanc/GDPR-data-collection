At 1-800-PetMeds®, we value your personal privacy. WE WILL NEVER SHARE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, TELEPHONE NUMBER OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION WITH ANYONE. Your name and address may be shared with marketers to bring you offers of interest.
Email address/Telephone number:
Your e-mail address and telephone number will be used only by 1-800-PetMeds® to notify you of your order status and when it is time to re-order your pet's medication. Occasionally 1-800-PetMeds® will have promotions or special offers which we feel you may benefit from and we will send you a notice. We may work with other providers who already possess your email address in order to engage in advertising and other promotional services. If for any reason you don't want to receive 1-800-PetMeds® promotions or special offers, you can simply e-mail optout@1800petmeds.com or click the Opt Out link in any e-mail that you may receive from 1-800-PetMeds®. You can also Opt Out online by using the following URL: https://www.1800petmeds.com/request.jsp and entering your email address.
Financial Information/Online Payment Security:
Also, 1-800-PetMeds® guarantees that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at our online store. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
Name and address:
Occasionally we will be made aware of special offers that we feel will be of interest to you. In such cases, we will supply your name and address to the company or companies that promote or provide these special offers. If for any reason you do not want us to provide this information to anyone, you can simply email optoutnameaddress@1800petmeds.com and tell us.
