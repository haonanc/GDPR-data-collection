Remove Your Name From Our Lists At Any Time
If you prefer not to receive catalogs or other communications from Harry & David or one of our brands via U.S. mail or telephone, please email Customer Service or contact us at the address shown above.
Because customer communications are often prepared well in advance of deployment (sometimes several months before the communication is made), you may continue to receive some communications after you send us a request not to use your information. We appreciate your patience during this time.
If you no longer wish to receive email communications from us regarding our Websites, partner offers, special offers or services, products, and/or newsletters, you may choose to stop receiving these emails at any time.

If you opt out of receiving marketing email, we will continue to send you emails regarding order confirmation and shipment notification when you place an order with us.
