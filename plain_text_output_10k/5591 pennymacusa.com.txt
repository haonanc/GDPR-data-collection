Cookies And Other Online Technologies
We may collect non-personal information by using cookies and pixel tags. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally.
A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our website but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
You may set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether or not to accept it. However, some of the features available on the site may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics
We may use tools called “Google Analytics” or “Adobe Analytics” to collect non-personal information about use of our sites. These tools collect information such as how often users visit a site, what pages they visit, when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from these tools only to improve this site. Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of these tools with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics plant a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google or Adobe. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy . Adobe’s ability to use and share information collected by Adobe Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by Adobe Analytics Terms of Service and the Adobe Privacy Policy . You can prevent Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.
How Long Do We Keep Information?
We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Online Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
"Do Not Track" Features
Your Internet browser may offer a ‘Do Not Track’ feature allowing you to tell us you want to opt out of tracking for some purposes. We may not separately respond to or take any action in response to a ‘Do Not Track’ setting in your Internet browser.
Linking To Other Sites
We may provide links to third party sites, such as credit bureaus, service providers or merchants. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by PennyMac, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions, as they may be different from those of our Sites. PennyMac does not guarantee and is not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of their information.
Advertising
PennyMac uses information described in this Notice to help advertise our products and services, including prescreened offers of credit, in a variety of ways. We use such information to present tailored ads, to you, analyze the effectiveness of our ads, and determine whether you might be interested in new products or services.
How we tailor ads
Relationship based advertising: In order to help make our advertising informative and useful, we may use information about your relationship with us to help determine which advertisements or offers to present to you.
Online Behavioral Advertising: We may use third party advertising companies to provide targeted display advertisements, likely to be of greater interest to you, through participating publishers and advertisers. To learn more about online behavioral advertising or to opt out of this type of advertising on many sites, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative.
Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive online advertising from PennyMac. Opting out from a specific third party site means that the ads you receive will not be based on your choices or behavior.
Direct Marketing: If you prefer we not deliver marketing offers via email, postal mail or telemarketing, you may manage your direct marketing by contacting us, refer to Contact Us section below.
Important Reminder:
In order for online behavioral advertising opt outs from our Sites and on other sites to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Site or other sites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.
Protecting Children's Privacy Online
Our sites and services are not intended for children under the age of thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent.

What Security Measures Are Used To Protect Your Information?
We take reasonable measures, including the implementation and maintenance of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards, in an effort to assure the security, integrity and accuracy of information under our control, in accordance to applicable federal and state laws. This includes device safeguards, and secured files and buildings, as well as oversight of our third party service providers.
