U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) makes decisions on benefit and             service requests that not only affect foreign nationals and their future, but also             the well-being of U.S. citizens, families, organizations, businesses, industries,             localities, states, the nation, and international communities. Accordingly, USCIS             strives to secure America’s promise as a nation of immigrants by providing accurate             and useful information, promoting awareness and understanding of citizenship             rights and responsibilities, and making adjudication decisions in a consistent and             accurate manner that furthers the goals and integrity of our nation’s immigration             system. Our policies drive our benefit and services decisions and ensure that our             guidance to USCIS officers who make those decisions reflects our agency’s mission,             and strategic vision. These policies also greatly affect our interaction with USCIS'             diverse stakeholder community.
USCIS has undertaken a comprehensive review of our immigration             policies to improve quality, transparency, and efficiency. As a result of this extensive             and ongoing review, USCIS has created the USCIS Policy Manual, which is the agency’s             centralized online repository for USCIS’ immigration policies. The USCIS Policy             Manual will ultimately replace the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM), the USCIS Immigration             Policy Memoranda site, and other policy repositories. The manual is structured to             house several volumes pertaining to different areas of immigration benefits administered             by the agency such as citizenship and naturalization, adjustment of status, admissibility,             protection and parole, nonimmigrants, refugees, asylees, immigrants, waivers, and             travel and employment.
The USCIS Policy Manual is organized into different volumes, parts, and chapters             that present policies in a logical and sequential manner. The USCIS Policy Manual             provides several user-friendly features and enhancements. These features include             up-to-the-minute comprehensive policy updates, an expanded table of contents, and             links to related Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sections, Code of Federal             Regulations (CFR), and public use forms. The manual is also equipped with a keyword             search function, which will make locating policy and related information faster,             easier, and less time consuming. Citations of statutes, regulations, case law, authoritative             sources, and other explanatory references appear in footnotes rather than the body             of the text. Tables and charts supplement and simplify policy information to facilitate             understanding of complex topics and instructions.
The USCIS Policy Manual provides transparency, including outlining             policies that are easy to understand, while also furthering consistency, quality,             and efficiency. The USCIS Policy Manual             contains the official policies of USCIS and must be followed by all USCIS officers             in the performance of their duties. The Policy Manual does not create any substantive             or procedural right or benefit that is legally enforceable by any party against             the United States or its agencies or officers or any other person.
