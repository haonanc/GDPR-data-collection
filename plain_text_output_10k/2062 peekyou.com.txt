Use of Personally Identifiable Information
Information we collect about your usage of PeekYou, by which you might be personally identified, is only used internally by PeekYou's team to improve our service. This information is never published, sold to third parties, or otherwise disclosed in any form that might be used to personally identify you. To the extent that we may share any of this data, we do so only after completely "anonymizing" it - i.e., removing any reference, whether direct or indirect, to your identity. But we may share with third parties non-personally identifying information about you, which could include demographics, interests, and other online habits from your PeekYou Page or recorded activity on our website.
Access Device and Browser Information
When you access PeekYou from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.
Site Activity Information
We keep track of some of the actions you take on PeekYou, such as if you click on an advertisement or third-party link, how often and for how long you visit any page of our website, your search history, and other information related to your use of PeekYou's services. We use this information to deliver the best possible service to you, improve PeekYou's user interface, deliver personalized search suggestions, etc.
Information from Cookies & Web Beacons
We use "cookies" (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) and "web beacons" (small objects embedded in a web page or e-mail, which are usually invisible to the user but make it possible to track whether that user has viewed the page or e-mail) to make PeekYou easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and PeekYou. For example, we use them to measure our traffic, to determine which pages or sections of our website you like best, to tailor your experience on our site to your preferences, etc. We also use them to learn know you interact with PeekYou applications and tools, our widgets and share buttons, and our advertisements. You can configure your browser to remove or block cookies, but doing so might result in an inferior user experience at PeekYou.
Links to Third-Party Websites
PeekYou's search results may contain links to third-party websites or to a cached copy of the third party's web-page that temporarily resides on our servers. If you click on any of these links you may leave our site. Once you do so, we are not responsible for your privacy or subsequent user experience at the third-party website, which may collect personal information about you. Even in those cases when the third parties in question are affiliated with us, they operate by separate privacy and data-collection practices independent of those of PeekYou. Since we are not responsible for, or have any control over, the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites, we encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website linked to by PeekYou.com.

PeekYou does not share personally identifying information with advertisers without your express permission.
Responding to Legal Requests and Preventing Harm
We may disclose personal information pursuant to subpoenas, court orders, or other requests (including criminal and civil matters) if we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law. This may include respecting requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law under the local laws in that jurisdiction, apply to users from that jurisdiction, and are consistent with generally accepted international standards. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms or Service . This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities.
Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control
If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the service can continue to operate. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.
