This Privacy Policy covers Spoonflower's treatment of personal information that our site gathers when you visit  it and use Spoonflower services, including without limitation the sale of designs through the marketplace. This policy  does not apply to the practices of third parties that Spoonflower does not own or control, or to individuals that  Spoonflower does not employ or manage.

Information Collected by Spoonflower and How it Is Used
We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website, which is to enable creative  people to print and share designs for textiles and other products and to share other information and ideas as a community.  This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience, inform you about new products and  creative ideas, to remember your preferences, to provide for the security of our site and users, to process transactions  and perform under agreements between you and Spoonflower, and to improve our services.  We do not process this information  in a way that is incompatible with these objectives.  For a complete list of the information we collect, where it is stored and which,  if any, third-party processors have access to the data, please see our Data Map .  The following summarizes the types of  information we collect from Spoonflower visitors:
Information You Provide to Us:
We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way (e.g. via e-mail, fax, etc.).      You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.
Registration: In order for you to use some Spoonflower services, such as viewing order history and saving custom designs, you        must complete a registration form. As part of this registration form, we require you to provide certain personal information, such        as your email address and to select a unique screen name that will be used to identify you throughout the site.
Profile: To allow you to express yourself more creatively, we may enable you to provide additional information, such as a bio,        favorite links, and profiles on other sites. In addition, you may choose to include photos of yourself in your profile. As indicated        below, in the section titled "Sharing Your Information", you can control how your information is displayed and used within the Spoonflower website.
Purchases: If you purchase materials or other products or services from us, we will collect and use your shipping address,       billing address, and phone number and credit card or other payment information to facilitate your purchases through our website.       We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the data you provide to us while placing an order with us online.        In addition to encrypting your credit card information while it is transmitted to our payment gateway, for your security, we do not      store credit card information in our database.
Selling: If you elect to make any of your designs available for purchase by others through the site, we will ask you to provide your       current address, e-mail address and certain tax information.  This tax information may include, but is not limited to, your complete and       correct name, (business name for legal entities), and tax ID, Social Security number or Tax Identification number (as applicable).        We will use any tax information you provide to report earnings from any sales to the United States Internal Revenue Service.
Automatic Information:
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Spoonflower and its agents and third party providers        (identified in the Data Map ) automatically receive and record certain "traffic data" on their server logs from your browser including your IP        address, the page you requested, how long you visit a page, how many times you visit a page, information you search for, browser type, browser       language, and the date and time of your request. Spoonflower uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends,        monitor compliance with its Terms of Service, improve its service and administer the website.
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize        your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.  Additionally, Spoonflower may use third-party cookies,        such as Google advertising cookies or similar Google anonymous identifiers to receive analytics regarding use of the website.  Spoonflower does not        combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.        We may use cookies to automatically remember who you are when you next visit our website, to perform analytics, provide a custom, personalized experience        on our website and monitor the success of marketing or promotional campaigns and aggregate metrics.  For a complete list of the cookies we use and what        the cookies are for, please see our Cookie Page.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to        command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  You may opt-out of the analytics provided by use of        the Google advertising cookies by installing an add-on to your web browser available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/        We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use our site - and others - as designed.
We have no access to, or control over, cookies stored on your computer by other third parties.
Spoonflower may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. This includes Profile pages.
Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Spoonflower will not be able to provide the experience we hope        to provide if we cannot recognize you, we encourage you to be aware that these programs are available.
Spoonflower may use cookie data and certain pseudoanonymized data about use of the Spoonflower website and services to improve the quality      and design of our website and services and we may track and analyze user preferences and trends to create new functions, promotions and      services for the Spoonflower website.  We may provide aggregated and statistical data about our users and use of our website and services to      third parties for such purposes as Spoonflower may deem appropriate from time to time.
Email Communications
Except as expressly set forth herein, we will never provide your email address to an unaffiliated third party without your explicit permission,  but we may use third party service providers who work on behalf of or with Spoonflower to provide services to you, which third parties may be granted  access to your email address and other information in order to provide the services.  For example, we use Bronto, a third-party service, to maintain and  administer our email list. We require that these parties agree to use such information solely for the purposes of providing Spoonflower’s services, that  they take adequate measures to protect the security of the information, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use or access to such information.
Spoonflower may send out emails with news, products, offers, surveys or promotions. You may also receive notification emails from Spoonflower that inform  you of actions (e.g. message notifications or when your design sells) that have been performed on the site. If you do not want to receive email from us,  please visit the Email Preferences section of your Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted e-mail message. However, please note that  in all cases you will continue to receive all system emails (e.g. those regarding forgotten user passwords or order confirmation emails) and legal notices  (e.g. updates to our policies) from us.
Sharing Your Information
Because Spoonflower enables people to discover and share designs with one another, information about the people who use Spoonflower is an important part  of our community. Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal information to any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes and that we  will share your personal information only as described below.
Spoonflower family of companies: Spoonflower may share your information within its family of companies, including Roostery and Sprout to provide      you with additional services and information relating to other products and services that may be of interest to you.
Spoonflower data processors:  Spoonflower partners with other service providers that provide support services to Spoonflower or that help      Spoonflower market its products and services, administer our programs, operations, fulfill your requests, surveys, contests, sweepstakes and product      reviews, or provide you with membership information.  Spoonflower may share your information with these service providers.  Spoonflower, however, requires,      that any such third-party service provider only access and use such information as directed by Spoonflower and not share such information with unauthorized      third parties.
Spoonflower employees: Spoonflower personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to member information in the normal course of      Spoonflower business.  We require that our employees and consultants or contractors access and use such information only as required to provide the Spoonflower services and do not share such information with unauthorized third parties.
Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, member information is typically one of the business      assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Spoonflower, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, member information would be one of the assets that is      transferred.
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights: We may release certain personal information to a third-party that submits a complaint to Spoonflower that one or      more of the designs you have uploaded to the site violates a copyright, trademark or other proprietary right.  The information we disclose in response to an      intellectual property complaint may include your name, e-mail address, mailing address or other information necessary for the third-party to contact you to      address the alleged violation.  We may also provide information concerning the timing and amount of any sales associated with an alleged infringing design.
Protection of Spoonflower and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to      enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Spoonflower, our employees, our members, or others. This      includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction and investigating or protecting against      intellectual property infringement.
Tax Reporting: If you elect to sell one or more designs through the marketplace available on the website, we will release earnings and certain tax information      to the United States Internal Revenue Service.
User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other      Spoonflower users in your Profile. The Profile is the area on Spoonflower where we allow you to tell other community members about yourself and your interests.      You may control what personal information is displayed in your Profile by visiting the Privacy Settings section of your Profile.
Public Profile: The screen name and public profile information that you submit upon registration will be searchable by other Spoonflower users unless you choose      not to have a public profile.
Social sharing of data: Spoonflower allows you to display your designs on your own blogs or on other sites and networks. The ability to do this is available via      your User Profile, via the Promotional Tools widget, or within the permalink URL of the design you wish to share. Spoonflower may choose to post this data on other      site features.
API Syndication: Spoonflower has developed an application program interface (API) that will enable approved third-party websites and software to interact with      the site and upload Content, view publicly available Content and/or order products utilizing Content that is made available for sale through the site.  Any information      or Content that you make publicly available on the site may be accessed and used by these third-party sites.
With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with      the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.

If you have any questions regarding security on our website, please contact help@spoonflower.com
