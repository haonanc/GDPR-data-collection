Personal information we may ask you for and how we might use it
When you visit our website, we may request personal information from you (such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc.) and only if you voluntarily provide it to us. Depending on the purpose for which the information was provided, we may use the information to communicate with you regarding our products, services, and promotions, to provide you with other information or materials that you request, to customize your interactive experience, and/or to improve our product and service offerings.
Here are the circumstances in which we might ask for personal information from our consumers though our website, the types of information we obtain, and how we might use the information:
If you contact one of our Consumer Services Representatives through our website, we may ask you for personal information such as your name, address, phone number, or e-mail address so that we can respond to your questions or comments. (Of course, if you send us an e-mail, we will at a minimum obtain your e-mail address.)
You may be asked to provide personal information if you:
register as a user of our website or post content to our website;
agree or ask to receive an online newsletter or other information or material from us;
register for a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion;
register to receive coupons through our website;
participate in a survey, a consumer research panel, or similar type of activity; or

Your participation in any of these activities is entirely voluntary. We may use the information you provide to respond to your questions or comments, to administer our promotions and websites, to fulfill your request, subscription, or order, to provide you with a customized interactive experience, or to otherwise provide or improve our products and services. Based on the information you provide, we also may obtain additional information about you, such as U.S. Postal Service address change data or demographic information, from commercially available sources.
We will not send you any online newsletter or similar e-mail communication unless you expressly consent to receive such a communication from us. And if you do choose to receive any such e-mail communication from us, you will always have the opportunity to “unsubscribe” from receiving the e-mail at any time.
