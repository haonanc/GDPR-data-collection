Information We Collect
The information we collect from users helps us not only provide the Service but also to personalize and continually improve each user's experience with the Service. Here are the types of information we gather:
Information You Give Us
Registering with us is strictly voluntary, and we do not collect any personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") when you do basic searches on the Service. However, registering with us enables you to take advantage of some of our advanced features. When you register with us, we ask you for Personal Information that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your email address. This enables us or the company you are inquiring about to respond to you directly. We will always obtain your express consent before sharing your Personal Information with any such company.
We may also collect information you supply to us regarding your personal preferences and interests. You can choose not to provide us with any or all of the information we specify or request, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some or all of our features. You can register by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites ("SNS") (including Facebook or Google+) via our Service. If you decide to register with us by logging into a SNS via the Service, we may extract the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your "real" name, email address and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that information to register with us; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS.
Once you register with us, you can optionally choose to contribute the following types of publicly viewable information in accordance with our Terms of Use ("Public Information"). Public Information is broadly available to the public, and is accordingly not subject to the protections described in this Privacy Policy. You should only upload Public Information if you are comfortable with these Terms.
Public Profile Information: When registering or after registering, you can optionally enter in other public profile information such as your name and contact information.
Public Content: You can create other types of content, such as questions, answers, reviews, ratings, bookmarks and comments, which may be displayed publicly along with associated metadata such as date and time created.
GetHuman does not knowingly collect Personal Information from minors. If we become aware of the fact that a minor is attempting to submit Personal Information, we will inform the minor that he or she is ineligible to do so. We will then remove this information from our records. If you are the parent/legal guardian of a minor who has given us Personal Information, you may contact us to delete it.
Automatic Information and Tracking Tools
Like many other websites, we and our vendors also collect information through cookies and other automated means. Information of this sort includes:
Technical information about your browser and mobile device: This information is used in the aggregate to help us optimize the Service for common browsers and devices.
Usage information, such as the pages you request, searches you conduct and the features you interact with: This behavioral information is collected and used in individualized and aggregate forms to generate statistics about how and by what demographic the Service is being used and to target advertising and communications but is never shared in any form that could be reasonably used to identify you personally.
IP address, cookies, tokens and device identifiers: These are alphanumeric identifiers that help us to distinguish between unique browsers and devices in order to avoid showing you the same information twice, keep you logged into the Service, prevent duplicate actions, prevent duplicate coupon redemptions and improve your experience. The information we collect from cookies may include your IP address, browser and device characteristics, referring URLs, and a record of your interactions with our Service. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. We will respect your choices relating to on-line tracking, whether you choose to reject individual cookies or set your web browser to reject cookies and other tracking technology. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Service or certain areas or features of the Service.
Additionally, we may integrate third party services in to our Service in order to personalize your experience. This policy only covers the use of cookies by us. Cookies placed by third party services are governed by the third party terms and privacy policies applicable to those services (which we encourage you to read). For more information about third-party tracking and your choices related to it, please see the Online behavioral advertising (and how to opt out of it) section, below.
Crashes and error reports: If you encounter a crash or error while using our Service, we may generate a crash report that includes technical, usage and, if you are logged in, your registered Personal Information so that we can diagnose and potentially prevent the problem in the future.

We may receive information from third parties such as public demographic information to help analyze the use of our services and expand our offering.

Further, because of the complexities of the technology involved, we cannot guarantee total or irrevocable deletion of your account information, and we cannot provide you with any specific timelines for deletion. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.
How We Share the Information We Collect
We do not sell, rent or trade your Personal Information to third parties (unless it is Public Information, as described above). In the normal course of business we shares Personal Information with our agents (such as employees, consultants, service providers and lawyers) to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share certain information with them in order to provide products or services to you. However, our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing the service to you as described in this Privacy Policy. We never provide your Personal Information to partners or advertisers, nor do we disclose aggregate information to a partner or advertiser in a manner that would identify you personally. We encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies as well. However, the use of this aggregate information by our service partners, as well as any Personal Information you directly provide to partners or advertisers, is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners and is not subject to our control.
Sometimes we may be required to share personal information in response to a regulation, court order or subpoena. We may also share information when we believe it's necessary to comply with the law. We also may share information to respond to a government request or when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our customers, or others; to prevent harm or loss; or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.
We may also share personal information in the event of a corporate sale, merger, acquisition, dissolution or similar event.
Online behavioral advertising (and how to opt out of it)
We may provide aggregate usage and demographic information to partners and advertisers to help them understand our audience and target their communications accordingly. This information may allow them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge the effectiveness of targeted advertisements. These advertisements may be based on information you submit, or your activities or behaviors on the Service. The information gathered may be used to serve you with advertisements on our Service or on third party websites, including mobile websites or applications. Please see http://www.youradchoices.com or http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ to further understand targeted advertising and your choices about it. Additionally, some third- party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies ( www.networkadvertising.org ). For more information about tracking and your choices related to it, please see Automatic Information and Tracking Tools section.
How We Protect the Information We Collect
We use reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal information under our control and appropriately limit access to it. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. The Service uses encryption technology, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), to protect your personal information during data transport. SSL protects information you submit via our Service such as ordering information including your name, address and credit card number. We will notify you by email if we have reason to believe that your Personal Information has been compromised due to a security breach or used in an unauthorized manner, but by using this Service, you agree to release us from any and all claims arising out of unauthorized use of your information.
