Non-Personally Identifiable Information
This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. We     gather certain information about you based on where you have shopped for on our web site in several     ways. This information is then compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregate basis.     Such non-personally identifiable information may include demographics and interest data. We use data     from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and     interests) with Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics' Demographic and Interest Reporting Tools     to figure out the general types of people who visit our store. Additional non-personally     identifiable information may also include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL")     information as well as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of     documents and resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for computer or device     on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web.     Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route or reroute information based on the IP address of the     destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your     computer whenever you are surfing the web, which allows web servers to locate and to identify your     computer. Computers require an IP addresses in order for users to communicate over the Internet.
