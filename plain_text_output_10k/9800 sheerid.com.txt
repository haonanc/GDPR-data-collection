Information you submit to us
By submitting your information to us, you agree to only submit your information and you consent to the use of your information as described in this privacy policy.
We will use the information you submit to us to verify your eligibility for our partners’ benefits, to send you newsletters or other information you request, to contact you, and to improve or develop our services. Verification of your eligibility may be automated or may be performed by our employees or shared with contractors who assist us in providing our services. We may supplement the information you submit with information that we receive from our partners or with other information we collect. We may also use and share your information in an aggregate and anonymized statistical form.
If you seek to accept a benefit from one of our partners, we will share your information with the partner. Your information may be used by our partners to provide you with products or services or to inform you of additional products or services. When your information is forwarded to our partner or when you land on one of our partner’s website, your information becomes subject to our partner’s privacy policy. Each partner’s privacy policy should be published on its website and you should review their policy as well as this one.
Correction of Information
If the information you submitted is incorrect, resulting in what you believe to be an error in the eligibility verification process, you may resubmit your information. You may also have the opportunity to submit a document that demonstrates your eligibility to receive one of our partner’s benefits. If you still do not qualify, please check that you are eligible for the partner’s benefits.

Dispute resolution
In the event a dispute arises between you and us, all claims will be resolved by binding arbitration at the request of either side. IF EITHER YOU OR WE CHOOSE ARBITRATION, NEITHER YOU NOR WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL AND CLAIMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS ACTION. All rights and obligations under this policy will be interpreted, governed, and enforced under the laws of Oregon, U.S.A. without giving effect to its choice or conflicts of law provisions. If you are a European Economic Area citizen or resident and believe we have violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you may also lodge a complaint with a GDPR supervisory authority.
Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, individuals may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
