Your questions and how to contact us

1. Information we collect
We collect personal information about you and the devices you use to access our Products and interact with us. We collect:
Registration information
When you register or sign up to use our Products, for contests or special events, we will collect information about you, which, depending on the Product, contest or event, may include your name, contact details, a password and security answers and may collect additional information that you choose to provide such as age, gender or personal preferences. We will also collect your contact information when you sign-up to receive our marketing communications.
You can also choose to sign-up for our Products using third-party services such as your Facebook, Google, Twitter or Instagram (“Social Network”) account in which case the Social Network may ask your permission to provide certain personal information such as your username, date of birth and contact details. The Social Network may share this personal information with us subject to the Social Network's privacy policy and the privacy settings of your Social Network account.  This may also enable the Social Network and us to link your activities with your personal registration information at their site, and may include notifying your friends about your activities whilst using our Products. This may also involve the use by us of analytics technologies to link your online activities so that we can serve targeted ads.  First party platforms, such as Apple’s App Store or Google’s Google Play store may for example share anonymized ids with us to help optimise our offerings to you and to help us understand how you are using our Products. If the first party platform shares this information with us it does so subject to its privacy policy, and the privacy settings of your first party platform account. If you sign-up via third-party services you should visit the third-party website and review their privacy policy and your registration profile or account to understand how your data is processed by them.
We do not control (nor act as the controller of) the information that is sent from your device to third parties, including social media platforms, analytics companies and advertising networks that receive information in the normal course of your online activities.
Technical and device information
We collect information from your device and activity about the way you use our Products. We may also collect information about you from the notifications or messages you post or send online as well as what you look at and engage with. Information obtained from social features related to Products, such as public forums or chat, may be stored, copied or used by Atlus U.S.A. Inc., the public, or third-party companies.
By accessing our Products, we will collect technical information from your mobile or computer device, for example your location information where you choose to share this with us, which devices are connected to the Internet, hardware settings, components of your devices, installed software, updates and plugins to facilitate the use of our Products. We will automatically collect information such as your operating system, Internet Protocol address, country and language settings, MAC address, your browser type, installed Products, hardware type, browser language preferences and when, how often and how long you interact our Products, as well as other application usage data. We also use software to enable us to provide safe and fair gaming environments for all users of our Products. When you log in to one of our Products, or make purchases, we, and or our third-party suppliers may use cookies and similar technologies, or collect data about your device(s) to create a device fingerprint of the components of your specific device(s) and/or a build an individual profile of you.

2. How we use the information we collect
We use the personal information we collect for the following purposes:
Registration information
Your registration information enables us to provide you with access to the Products and to supply the Products under the relevant terms of service. It helps us to authenticate your access, to contact you for your views and to notify you of important changes or updates to our Products.
Where we have your consent and in accordance with your stated communication preferences, we may also contact you for marketing purposes to let you know by post, email, telephone, mobile or in-app messaging about our other products and services.
If you no longer want us to use your data in this way or generally change your mind about receiving marketing communications, you can unsubscribe at any time, either by using the unsubscribe option in the communication you receive or by changing your communication settings. Please note that we will retain a record of the user information when you unsubscribe from our marketing information for the legitimate purpose of ensuring that we do not contact you further in this way, during the period of your objection.
Technical and device information
We analyze information about how you engage with our Products to understand how our Products are used and to provide you with an optimal gaming experience, such as by rolling out performance-optimizing updates for our Products.   We use anonymous data in order to analyze and produce statistics relating to the habits, usage patterns and demographics of users as a group or as individuals.
When you interact or visit our websites, we will automatically collect information about you such as the type of internet browser or mobile device you use, any website from which you have come to any of the Atlus U.S.A. Inc. sites, your IP address (the quasi-unique address which identifies your device on the internet), country where the device is located, language settings and your operating system, which are automatically recognized by our web server.
We use log files to monitor traffic on our Products, resolve technical problems and to detect and prevent fraud.  We use these technologies to provide us with information, such as when an email is opened, or to develop statistics on the effectiveness of advertising or marketing on our websites and for and in our Products. In some cases, including working with third party partners, we use this information to send you ads for our Products or other’s products based on your interest.
We also use technical and device information to operate and improve our Products, enable online matchmaking, facilitate sharing, measure our effectiveness, set up and maintain accounts, track consents to use of personal data, identify and fix errors and to help keep online content fair and safe and to resolve related disputes. We also use this information to deliver you personalized content, help us understand the features of our Products that appeal to you and allows us to manage advertising.

We use your feedback to reply to your questions or queries, to provide customer support and resolve problems relating to any of our Products under the relevant terms of service. We will also publish reviews that you submit to us for this purpose about the Products and will conduct analysis of feedback for the purpose of improving and developing the Products.
3. When we share information
In delivering the Products to you, we may share your personal information with:
Companies within the SEGA group (which means our subsidiaries and affiliates, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates) who act for us for the purposes set out in this policy.
If our business enters into a joint venture, purchases or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their advisors.
We may use the information that you provide if we are under a duty to disclose or share your information in order to comply with (and/or where we believe we are under a duty to comply with) any legal obligation; or to enforce the relevant terms of service and any other agreement; or to protect our rights or the rights of third parties. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations such as credit agencies, law enforcement or government bodies or the courts in connection with a criminal investigation, suspected illegal activity, fraud prevention and detection or in legal proceedings.
We do not control information which is sent from your browser to third parties, and may not control certain information which is sent from our Products to third parties, including social media platforms, analytics companies and advertising networks that receive information in the normal course of your online activities.
Personal information may be transferred to other countries where we or our service providers maintain operations. These countries may not have equivalent data protection laws to the country from where you access the Products or, in the case of transfers subject to European law, may not be subject to an adequacy decision by the European Commission (EC).   An adequacy decision is a decision taken by the EC establishing that a third country provides a comparable level of protection of personal data to that in the EU, through its domestic law or its international commitments.
When we transfer personal information, we will seek to take account of any applicable legal obligations relevant to personal information transfers.  In the case of transfers of personal information out of the European Economic Area, we will, in the absence of an EC adequacy decision relevant to the destination country, seek to rely on appropriate safeguards such as a valid Privacy Shield certification (in the case of a data transfer to a Privacy Shield certified US recipient - https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome ) or enter into appropriate EC approved standard contractual clauses relevant to personal data transfers between data controllers or between a data controller and a data processor, (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm ).
4. Security and data retention
We take reasonable physical, technical and organizational measures, to protect your information from unauthorized access and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.
Your personal information will be retained by us for the duration of your use or access to our Products and may be retained for a period after this time as necessary and relevant to our legitimate operations, our terms with you and in accordance with applicable laws and obligations. This may include retention necessary to meet our tax reporting requirements as well as time required to enforce the relevant terms of service, any game “sun-setting” requirements or to identify, issue or resolve legal proceedings.
We may retain a record of your stated objection to the processing of your data, including in respect of an objection to receiving marketing communications, for the sole purpose of ensuring that we can continue to respect your wishes to not contact you further, during the term of your objection.
We will take appropriate steps to seek to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information at the point this information is no longer needed by us for our business or legal purposes, when you withdraw consent (as applicable) or at your request.
5. Your choices and rights
You have options and choices over how we use your information. We provide you with tools to access and update specific information relating to your use of the Products at any time. If you need to sign in to access certain Products, you can update and amend your key contact information directly.
We respect the rights you may have under applicable law to request access to your personal information and where applicable, to request to receive that information in a commonly used electronic format (or ask for this information to be provided in that format to a third party where feasible). You may also have the right under applicable law to request the correction or erasure of your personal information, to seek to object to the further processing under certain circumstances of your information or to request that the processing of specific information about you is restricted while we verify or investigate your concerns about this information.  We do not verify the correctness of your personal information.
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms.  For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com .
Please contact us as described in Section 7 to exercise any of these rights.
If you remain unhappy with a response you receive, and are in the European Union, you can also refer the matter to your data protection supervisory authority (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm ).
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (“Shine the Light”) permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please contact us as described below in Section 7 “Contact Us” . Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.
In addition, if you believe that we have not responded to your privacy-related inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact Atlus U.S.A. Inc.’s Data Protection Officer (DPO@sega.net) or the ESRB at https://www.esrb.org/privacy/contact.jsp , or
