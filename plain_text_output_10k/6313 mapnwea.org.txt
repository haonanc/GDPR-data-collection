Browser Cookies
As with many other sites, this Website may use “cookies” or other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. Cookies are small text files that a Website can send to a user’s browser for storage on the hard drive. Cookies can make use of the Web easier by saving and administering status, preferences and other user information.
This Website also may use Web beacons, which are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a Web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. The Web beacons may be served by third party services or NWEA servers. We may use cookies and Web beacons in order to properly route users through the site, customize users’ experiences on the site, to help us send you information about products and services you may be interested in, and to help us improve the Website. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies but users can change the setting to block cookies. Although disabling cookies will not interfere with your ability to access the site, users will need to accept cookies in order to use certain services on the site. Users can disable the ability of Web beacons to capture information by blocking cookies. Currently, our sites do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this Privacy Policy (e.g., by disabling cookies, or using ‘private’ browsing modes).
