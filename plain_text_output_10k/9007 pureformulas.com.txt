Scope
This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information in providing our services on the PUREFORMULAS.COM, Inc. (“PUREFORMULAS.COM”) websites, tools, applications, and services. It applies generally to the PUREFORMULAS.COM website and content and other related websites that we operate and which are linked directly or indirectly to the PUREFORMULAS.COM website. This policy does not apply to Third Party Processors as defined in the PUREFORMULAS.COM User Agreement. Some PUREFORMULAS.COM-branded websites or websites we operate may be governed by separate privacy policies. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective on June 31, 2017.
Data Collection
You can browse our site anonymously without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. If you do, we may anonymously track your internet IP address, time, and page access in order to assess how to improve our service. You will provide us with personal information which we will collect if you choose to:
• Register on our site
• Respond to a survey
The information that you provide us includes:
• When you sign up on PUREFORMULAS.COM, you may give us information such as your name, zip code, and date of birth
• When you purchase one of our products, you give us your billing information, which may include your credit card data; however, this data, including the credit card number and CVV, is encrypted and cannot be used for anything other than the order that you authorized
• We will collect your viewing habits
• We will collect usage information
The principal reasons that we collect information in such circumstances are:
• To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)
• To improve our website and your shopping experience (we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)
• To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)
• Help prevent fraud
• To process transactions
If you provide us with personal information directly or through your use of the system, you consent to our transfer, storage and use of that information. We may collect and store the following personal information:
• Transactional information based on your activities on the sites (such as buying, selling, item and content you generate or that relates to your account)
• Shipping, billing and other information you provide to purchase or ship an item
• Community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our sites, and correspondence sent to us
• Other information from your interaction with our sites, services, content and advertising, including device ID, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information
• Additional information we ask you to submit to authenticate yourself or if we believe you are violating site policies (for example, we may ask you to send us an ID or bill to verify your address, or to answer additional questions online to help verify your identity)
• Information from other companies, such as demographic and navigation data
• Other supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to PUREFORMULAS.COM, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law. We also could obtain information from the Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce or the Land Registry, social media platforms and public online sources).
Information related to your use of the payment platform on PUREFORMULAS.COM including email address, phone number, physical contact information, and (depending on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit card or bank account numbers may be kept by the Third-Party Processor used by PUREFORMULAS.COM to transact your payment. PUREFORMULAS.COM will not collect or maintain information collected in the payment process.
Marketing
We don’t sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize our services, content and advertising. We will provide you with a newsletter, sales flyers and special offers emails from time to time. You can opt out of the newsletter, sales flyers and/or the special offers e-mails on your account page, or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions included in all such e-mailings or by contacting us at HELP@PUREFORMULAS.COM.
Use
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You agree that we may use your personal information to:
• Provide the services and customer support you request
• Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems
• Prevent, detect, and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement
• Customize, measure and improve our services, content and advertising
• Tell you about our services and those of our corporate family, deliver targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and
• Compare information for accuracy, and verify it with third-parties
• And other uses as described when we collect the information
Third Party Sign-on Service and Sharing Information
We may offer single sign-on services that allow you to use third-party login credentials to sign into PUREFORMULAS.COM. With your permission, PUREFORMULAS.COM may also transfer to PUREFORMULAS.COM profile information contained in your third-party profile should services with third parties be offered. PUREFORMULAS.COM may also, for your use, enable you to import information about who you are connected to, as well as enable you to share information with those third-party sites. If you wish to discontinue such sharing, you will be able to do so through by updating your preference in the third party’s page.
The Disclosure of Your Information
We may share your personal information with:
• Members of the PUREFORMULAS.COM corporate family to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications. Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you’ve requested their services
• Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded credit cards)
• Other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific service)
• Law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a subpoena or other enforceable legal request relating to a civil lawsuit or criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other PUREFORMULAS.COM user to legal liability. In such events, we will disclose information relevant to the investigation, such as name, city, state, ZIP code, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, buying and return history, and anything else we may deem relevant to the investigation. If we are allowed to do so by law, we will provide you with notice of such legal action
• Other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)
Cookie Usage
We use "cookies" on certain of our pages. Cookies are small record keeping files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser. Cookies allow our systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information in order to make your future interaction with our site easier and more convenient. A few important things you should know about cookies are that:
• We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies
• We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status
• Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session
• You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services
• You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie placed by that web page.) For cookies that are not necessary for the use of the website, we need your permission. On your first visit to the website, we request your unambiguous consent for the use of cookies. You can set up your browser so that you do not receive any non-functional cookies during your visit to the website. These privacy conditions apply only to the use of PUREFORMULAS.COM's cookies. The use of cookies and other techniques used by third parties is subject to their own privacy conditions.
Use of Google Analytics
PUREFORMULAS.COM uses Google Analytics to obtain insight into, inter alia, visitor flows, traffic sources and page views on our website. This means that Google acts as Processor in PUREFORMULAS.COM's processing of personal data. PUREFORMULAS.COM has concluded a Processing Agreement with Google for this purpose.
Information collected with Google Analytics is anonymised to the extent possible. For example, PUREFORMULAS.COM does not have detailed insight into individual visitor details. Google will never process your full IP address and always masks the final octet of your IP address.
The information obtained is stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google is a party to the EU - US Privacy Shield convention of the US Ministry of Trade. Google may only provide your information to third parties if Google is statutorily obliged to do so, or to the extent that third parties process the information on Google's behalf. For more information, read Google's Privacy Policy.
Widgets
Our website includes Widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from other companies. Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Information collected by this Widget is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
No Spam, Spyware or Spoofing
We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your PUREFORMULAS.COM communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other PUREFORMULAS.COM users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report PUREFORMULAS.COM-related spam or spoof emails to PUREFORMULAS.COM, please forward the email to HELP@PUREFORMULAS.COM. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User Agreement. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
Links to Other Websites
Our site includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of PUREFORMULAS.COM. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit.
Blogs and Community Forums
Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas could potentially be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Moreover, the information provided on these sites by third parties is not approved or endorsed by PUREFORMULAS.COM. If you spot any posting that you feel are inappropriate or violate our terms and conditions, please notify us at HELP@PUREFORMULAS.COM.
What Is the Policy for Visitors From Outside The U.S.?
If you are visiting our U.S. website from the European Union or another territory that falls under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), please note that by browsing our site or by providing us with your information, you consent to our gathering of anonymous data that will be stored in accordance with GDPR privacy laws, regulations, and standards.
Minors
Our Services are intended for a general audience. We do not create accounts or accept orders or allow use of our sites by minors under the age of 18.
"Do Not Track" Signals
Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals to the websites and other online services with which the browser communicates. There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. PUREFORMULAS.COM currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.
Account Protection
Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your PUREFORMULAS.COM password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify PUREFORMULAS.COM and change your password.
Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information
You can see, review, supplement and change most of your personal information by signing on to PUREFORMULAS.COM. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. You can delete or block your personal data if it is being processed in contravention with any statutory provision. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our PUREFORMULAS.COM User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law. Even if your account is closed, reviews that you have submitted may stay visible on the site at our sole discretion. Please note that should an existing PureFormulas customer wishes to delete their account, we will always do so upon request, removing all information previously collected.
Security
To the extent that PUREFORMULAS.COM or its Third-Party Processors maintain any information on you, your payment methods, your habits or your purchases, that information is maintained in servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third-parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
Third Parties
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others on our sites or on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. PUREFORMULAS.COM does not control the privacy policies of third-parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third-parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
Retention period
PUREFORMULAS.COM will not retain your personal data any longer than is necessary for achieving the purposes stated in this Privacy Statement or for complying with statutory retention periods.
Complaints procedure
At PUREFORMULAS.COM we attach great value to the quality of our work and the satisfaction of our customers with the services we provide. That is why we regularly survey customer satisfaction levels and use the results to further improve our services. If you feel that aspects of our services could be improved, please bring it to the attention. We will take all the steps necessary to resolve the matter to your satisfaction. If you still feel the matter has not been resolved, you can use our complaints procedure. For more information on this option, please contact us via help@pureformulas.com
In addition, you have at all times the right and the option to submit a complaint about PUREFORMULAS.COM's processing of personal data to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.
