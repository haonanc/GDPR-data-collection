Who we are
When you visit our Websites, use our Services, or interact with us via our Social Pages or otherwise submit information to us, Jamie Oliver Limited (‘us’ and ‘we’) is a ‘data controller’ and gathers and uses certain information about you. When we do so we are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation which applies across the European Union (and will still apply to the United Kingdom even after Brexit) and local applicable laws.
Other companies might sell Jamie Oliver-branded products or provide Jamie Oliver related services under licence. Please make sure you always check the privacy policy of the websites you use so you know who runs the website and how they will use your personal information.
Information we collect about you
The types of information we collect about you depends on how you interact with us. There are three ways in which we may collect your personal information:
directly from you;
automatically.
The table set out under the section 'More about the information we collect and hold' at the bottom of this policy sets out in detail the information we collect and hold about you by each of these methods. For a summary of each method, click below.

submit content to us, for example if you post a selfie and use one of our hashtags on your public social media account in response to one of our competitions (please also read our Terms for Contributions )
Information received from other sources
Sometimes we also obtain information about you from other sources, for example when you:
use any of our Services or Website Functions which enable you to sign-in via a third party service, for example if you log-in to your jamieoliver.com account with Facebook or comment on a recipe using Disqus - we receive some of your account information

Generally, the reasons we use your personal information can be categorised as follows:
to personalise our Services to you
to enable you to partake in our prize draws or competitions
to maintain and improve our Services and our Websites’ infrastructure

Who we share your personal information with
With other Jamie Oliver Companies
We routinely share infrastructure, resources and technology with our affiliated companies Jamie Oliver Productions Ltd and Jamie Oliver Licensing Ltd (‘Jamie Oliver Companies’).

Vendors and service providers
We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analysing how our Websites and services are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments, conducting surveys, or providing fraud detection service.
We may also need to share personal information with other parties, such as external contractors and our professional advisers and potential purchasers of some or all of our business or on a re-structuring. Usually, information will be anonymised but this may not always be possible. We contractually bind all third parties with whom we share personal information to keep your information confidential and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services and pursuant to the applicable privacy legislation in the EU. We may also be required to share some personal information as required to comply with the law.

We’ve outlined in the table below, why each category of personal information we collect from you is required from us to be able to perform the purpose to which it relates and the possible consequences of failing to provide such information. We seek to ensure that our information collection and processing is always proportionate. We will inform you at the point of collecting information from you, whether you are required to provide the information to us or not. We will notify you of any changes to information we collect from you or to the purposes for which we collect and process it.
How long your personal information will be kept

Reasons we can collect and use your personal information
This section addresses the legal basis for processing your personal data. Some processing is addressed in multiple sections in the Table set out below because more than one legal basis may apply depending on the circumstances or service and to make it easy for you.

to fulfil and enforce our Terms of Use , Terms for Contributions and any other contract we have with you

Transfer of your information out of the EEA
To deliver the Websites and our Services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), eg:
with your and our service providers located outside the EEA
if you are based outside the EEA
These transfers are subject to special rules under European and UK data protection law. Prior to permitting such transfers, we carry out assessments to ensure all personal information transferred will be kept secure. Our standard practice is to use standard data protection model contract clauses that have been approved by the European Commission (as permitted under Article 46(2) of the General Data Protection Regulation) or to only transfer your data to companies that are registered with the Privacy Shield (for transfers to the USA). If you would like further information please see ‘How to contact us’ below.

Under the General Data Protection Regulation you have a number of important rights free of charge. In summary, you have the right to access your personal data and require that we rectify any errors in the data that we hold, or request that we erase your personal data subject to certain limitations. In some circumstances, you can also require that we restrict the way we process your personal data, object to its processing or request a copy of your personal data for the purposes of transmitting elsewhere. Where we have requested and obtained your consent to process particular information, you may withdraw that consent at any time. However if we do not hold all the data we need to administer contracts, orders, competitions or challenges you entered into, we may not be able to provide you with these benefits any longer.
If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please send your request to legal@jamieoliver.com or write to us at “Data Protection Officer, Benwell House, 15-21 Benwell Road, London, England” and:
let us have enough information to identify you (eg your full name and contact details - including your email address); and
let us know what right you want to exercise and the information to which your request relates (eg details of the specific information you require and any relevant dates).
Please note that we may ask you to provide proof of identity when considering your request.

Keeping your personal information secure
We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal information from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
