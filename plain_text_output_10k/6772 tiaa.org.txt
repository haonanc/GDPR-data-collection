How your information is used
We use your personal information primarily to provide you with the products and services you request, and we share and use your personal information relating to transactions, balances, payment history and similar experiences among the TIAA Companies to conduct their business. Unless you have told us otherwise, pursuant to “Your right to opt out” below, we may also use your personal information to market or determine your possible interest in products and services that the other TIAA Companies offer. If you are a participant in an employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan investing in a TIAA or third-party annuity contract or a TIAA or third-party mutual fund, we may share the information we collect with your employer and its agents, if any, for plan administration purposes.
Disclosure of your information
We share your personal information with other TIAA Companies as permitted by law. We will not disclose your personal information to anyone outside of the TIAA Companies unless: 1) we have received proper consent from you; 2) we are legally permitted to do so; or 3) we reasonably believe, in good faith, that we are legally required to do so. For example, we may provide the information to assist us with various aspects of conducting our business, to comply with laws or industry regulations, and/or to effectuate any action that you have requested, including the following:
Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., fulfillment companies and securities clearinghouses, data processing services, printers and mailing facilities) engaged by us
Unaffiliated service providers (e.g., third-party administrators) engaged by your employer
Unaffiliated fund and/or insurance companies and their agents whose investment options are made available to you through your employer-sponsored retirement or savings plan, provided monies are allocated to them on your behalf

Other organizations, as permitted or required by law (e.g., for fraud prevention)
Security of your information
TIAA protects the personal information you provide against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, destruction, loss, or misuse.

We also require our service providers to protect your personal information by utilizing the privacy and security safeguards required by law.
Your right to opt out
Providing us with access to your information permits us to offer you distinct advantages and better service. It enables us to provide you with more comprehensive financial guidance. Sharing and using your information helps us tailor product offerings to you and eliminate those that may not interest you. This helps us keep expenses low.
Federal law gives you the right to limit some but not all sharing of your personal information. You may not limit sharing of information of your transactions and experiences with TIAA Companies, but you may limit sharing of information about your creditworthiness.
Unless you tell us otherwise and opt out, (i) the TIAA Company(ies) with which you have a business relationship may share information about your creditworthiness with other TIAA Companies or (ii) other TIAA Companies may use your personal information for marketing purposes. If you are a Vermont resident, state law gives you an additional right: we will not share information about your creditworthiness with other TIAA Companies except with your consent.
If you opt out, the TIAA Company(ies) with which you have a business relationship will still notify you of their new products or services. Please note that we cannot withdraw any previous disclosures made with your authorization.
To opt out of either information sharing or marketing, or both, please call the National Contact Center weekdays, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (ET) at 877-518-9161. You may receive more than one privacy notice from the TIAA Companies depending on the products you own.
 
Either of you may opt out for both of you
If you opt out separately, we will limit disclosure of information only for the owner who has opted out. If you indicate that you are opting out for the co-owner as well, we will limit disclosure for both of you.
Your opt-out becomes effective as soon as practicable. It remains in effect until you revoke it in writing.  Even if you have opted out, you will receive our privacy notice as required by law.
