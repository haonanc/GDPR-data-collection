Notification of Changes
Flavorpill Productions reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter these terms and conditions at any time. Such changes and/or modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof. Please review the terms and conditions periodically.

Subscriber Lists
Flavorpill Productions owns the publications Flavorpill, Artkrush, Boldtype, Earplug, and Activate and all other Flavorpill-branded email newsletters, all of which are governed by this Privacy Policy. In the event that Flavorpill Productions or any of its assets are purchased by a third party, the Company will request that all data be governed by this Privacy Policy and continue to be governed under these same terms following any sale.
Flavorpill Productions also may from time to time consolidate its subscription lists and email products, and under such circumstances, will first notify users of the change and provide the option to opt out. Flavorpill also sends occasional “Dedicated” sponsored emails to the subscription lists, promoting a product, service or offer from one of our partners. In such cases, the emails are created, written, and sent from Flavorpill and the addresses are never shared with our partners. Subscribers to all Flavorpill publications are automatically added to the “Dedicated” email list. Flavorpill may also, from time-to-time, send subscribers emails announcing other Flavorpill publications with the option to subscribe.
