Technologies such as cookies or similar technologies are used by Goldstar Events Inc. and our partners (e.g. analytics and advertising partners), affiliates, or analytics or service providers (e.g. advertising, analytics, and monitoring partners).

We also utilize pixel tags/web beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded on the Site that collects information about users' engagement on that web page.

The Site's signup forms, purchase forms, contact us forms, surveys and contests may require you to give us contact information (such as your name and email address), unique identifiers (such as a username and password), and demographic information (such as your ZIP code or age). Purchase forms require financial information (such as your account or credit card numbers and billing address) as well. You may be asked to provide a shipping address if the tickets you purchase will be delivered by mail.
If your purchase is a gift for another person, we may require and collect that person's third party Personal Information and share such information with vendors and service providers providing services on behalf of Goldstar. Specifically, we may provide the gift recipient's name and/or phone number to the venue or event promoter. If the tickets are mailed, we require the recipient's shipping address.

Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
12. User Data Supplementation
We may receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or Third Parties from whom we have purchased data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. Â This helps us to update, expand and analyze our records, identify new users, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you. Â If you provide us Personal Information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.
Examples of the types of Personal Information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from Third Parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include:
Address information about you from Third-Party sources, such as the U.S. Postal Service, to verify your address so we can properly ship your tickets to you and to prevent fraud.
Purchased marketing data about our users from Third Parties that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored event recommendations.
13. How We Use Contact Information
Your contact information is used to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into by you on the Site. A limited amount of Personal Information is provided to the venues, event organizers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events for which you purchase tickets. Specifically, we disclose your name or the name of the gift recipients. In addition, we may disclose your or a gift recipient's contact information, include email address, to service providers, such as payment processors, that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf, including completing transactions that you initiate through the Site. As you may request, we may also disclose other Personal Information specifically related to your purchase such as the need for accessible or ADA seating. In rare instances, we may also need to disclose your phone number to the venue or event promoter to notify you of last minute changes that will affect your purchase. Examples of this might include cancellations and postponements on the day of the event. If tickets will be delivered by mail, your shipping address may also be disclosed. Your credit card information and/or demographic information will not be disclosed. Your billing address will also not be disclosed unless it is also the shipping address. For some purchases, we may require additional permission from you to disclose other Personal Information such as your email address. A notice of what Personal Information and how it will be used will appear during the checkout process. Venues, organizers, promoters and/or their affiliated agents of the events are specifically prohibited from using Personal Information provided to them for any purpose other than fulfilling your purchase or admission or for analytics purposes, unless you specifically opt-in and authorize other uses. Once opted-in, you may opt out by contacting the appropriate Third-Party organizer, promoter, or venue.
We also use customer contact information we collect in order to send you information and offers from Goldstar. We carefully select the information we send in an effort to provide you information that offers real value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or special event information. You may opt-out of all special event notifications by editing your email subscription .
14. How We Use Feedback and Ratings
If you buy tickets to an event on the Site, we may solicit you by email for your feedback on the experience. Feedback may include ratings, reviews, names, taglines and/or photos. If you choose to give us feedback and you make your feedback public, it will be displayed on the Site in association with the specific event or venue, and shared with the venue or producers of the event. Goldstar may also use all or part of your review as part of the "Roar of the Crowd" email along with your member profile name. If you choose not to make your feedback public, it will only be made available anonymously to the venue or producers of the event, but not to the public at large or to other venues and producers. In the event that you discontinue your membership, all feedback and your member profile will be considered not public and will not be published on the Site. To request removal of your Personal Information from these posted feedbacks, please contact us . In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
We strongly discourage you from disclosing any Personal Information, such as email addresses, phone numbers or credit card information, in your feedback, especially if you've chosen to make it public. If you disclose any personal information in your feedback that you have chosen to make public, anyone will be able to see this information. If you disclose any Personal Information in your feedback that you have chosen not to make public, such as your email address, the venue and their staff will have access to this information but they are prohibited from using it to send you unsolicited messages. From time to time, Goldstar or the venue may want to reprint or reuse feedback as a testimonial or quote outside of the Site. For example, a venue may want to include it in marketing materials. When such occasions arise, we will contact you to obtain your consent. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us .
15. How We Use Financial Information
Financial information that is collected fro you is used to check your qualifications and to bill you for products and Services. We will not share financial information or Personal Information with Third Parties unless it is necessary to process your transaction (i.e. processing your credit card for payment).
16. How We Use Demographic Information
We use this information to tailor the Site to the interests of our users. This information is shared with Third Parties only on an aggregate basis so that they can tailor our content to the appropriate audience.

The Site may make available a service either directly or through third parties by which you can receive messages on your wireless device via short message service ("SMS").

The use of this information will be in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies. You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks. We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any SMS messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your network operator. SMS message services are provided on an AS IS basis. We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service. You may opt out of the SMS Service at any time by replying "STOP" to the SMS text message you have received. This process impacts only the future delivery of the particular SMS message offering, so you must send that message for each offering.

The types of service providers to whom we entrust Personal Information include service providers for: (i) provision of IT and related services; (ii) provision of information and services you have requested; (iii) payment processing; (iv) customer service activities; and (v) in connection with the provision of the Site.

These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit non-Goldstar related websites within their networks as discussed in Section 6. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising."

In such event, Goldstar will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.

"Do Not Track".
Do Not Track ("DNT") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Please note that we do not respond to or honor DNT signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.
Cookies and Interest-Based Advertising.
As noted above, you may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.
The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt out of receiving targeted ads from our data partners and our other advertising partners that participate in self-regulatory programs. You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp , or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ and http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ . You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here .
To be clear, whether you are using our opt-out or an online industry opt-out, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted-out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes.
27. Data Retention
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, and up to ten years after you delete your account, or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which the information was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
28. Our Security Precautions
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. The Personal Information that you provide to us is stored on servers, which are located in secured facilities with restricted access, and protected by protocols and procedures designed to maintain the security of your Personal Information when you complete a transaction or access your Personal Information. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts all of your sensitive information, including credit card number, as it is transmitted through the Internet. However, no server, computer or communications network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at help@goldstar.com .
By using the Site or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Site.

If you have created a public profile on our Site, you can change, modify and/or delete the profile information you have provided to us by editing feedback in your profile . Changing or deleting any of this data will change or delete the data only in our member database, but will not change or delete information which we have collected as part of a particular ticket purchase in our transactions database.

Although Goldstar makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Goldstar is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others' privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual's privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Goldstar determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Goldstar will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
30. Mediation
