Our Approach to Privacy & Spam
My Survey Privacy Policy ( UK )
Lightspeed Privacy Policy May 2018 – Lightspeed Panels (all territories and panels EXCEPT Australia, including consumer and HCP panels)
1.  Introduction
This Privacy Policy sets out the commitment of Lightspeed Research Limited, 4 Millbank, Westminster, London, SW1P 3JA, UK ("Lightspeed"), a Kantar group company ("Kantar"), to the privacy of its panel members (“Panellists”, “Panellist”), and governs Panellists’ rights regarding privacy and data protection.
This Privacy Policy applies to the Lightspeed panels known as MySurvey, GlobalTestMarket, LifePoints and All Global Circle, altogether identified in this Privacy Policy as the Lightspeed panels (the “Panels”). Panellists are members of the Panels, operated by Lightspeed and for which Lightspeed is the data controller. Taking part in our panels, surveys and research activities is entirely voluntary. By registering to the Panels and accepting these terms, you confirm that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Policy. We ask you to read this Privacy Policy carefully.
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means any information which relates to an identifiable living individual.
2.  Lawful Collection and Use of Data
Lightspeed collects information in several ways from different parts of our site, our mobile application and other Panellist activities such as social media, apps and surveys. Examples of these activities are explained below and include:
Registration:
some personal data is gathered when you register, such as name, email address, postal address, mobile device ID, medical education number (US), GMC Number (UK), le numéro RPPS (France), and el número de colegiado (Spain).
Panel Surveys or Research Activities:
personal data may also be collected from you when you participate in a survey or in a research activity proposed by the Panels, such as use of a specific app, passive tracking or social tracking.
Account Preferences:
you may decide to share your mobile number or your social network ID/account with us or you may provide other personal data when setting up your account or at a later stage.
In summary (we’ve provided more details below), the main purposes for which we use your personal data are to:

We have set out below more detailed information about how we use your personal data. We are also required by law to explain the legal basis for processing your personal data. These legal bases are listed below and could be different for each use case:
we have your consent for the use of your personal data
we need to use your personal data in order to perform a contract with you

Tracking of the Answers of Recurring Respondents (special research design projects)
When you participate in our surveys, we typically use a temporary ID which makes your answers in the survey anonymous to our clients. However, some of our clients have the specific research design need to understand how your opinion has evolved over a period of time. For this specific project type that we call "tracking" projects we will use persistent IDs and we will make this clear at the beginning of each of these surveys. Your survey responses will be considered as personal data and you will have the right to access them. Such projects will contain a notice on the very first page of the survey, so that you can identify them and decide whether or not to take part.
Persistent unique project-specific identifier
Data Matching and Enrichment
We enrich the data we hold on file about you by matching your personal data with third parties. This will help us to improve your panel profile and ensure that we select relevant surveys for you.
We utilize matching services (i.e. third parties who are specialized in data management) to acquire additional information about you from public and private data sources (such as social networks, retailers and content subscription services with whom you have an account) or to use your personal data as an aid to develop additional or new types of anonymous data sets (i.e. we compile your aggregate data with data from other consumers to create a new lifestyle segment). The matching service (our partner) holds the personal data we share for a short time, uses it to assemble the additional information, and then return the combined information to us. Partners are contractually bound to delete the data we share with them or and are not authorised to use it in any way other than for this specific purpose.
Persistent unique identifier, contact details, email address, social login, cookie, mobile device ID, official identification number (i.e. ME number)
Advertising Targeting and Media Buying Research
We use your personal data to help our clients and vendors enrich their data by using lookalike modelling techniques.
Thanks to your participation in our surveys and your profile data, we can help our clients to improve their advertising targeting, and to create better online advertising models, through lookalike modelling or similar research methodologies. We will use your personal data we collect about you through profile building, participation in research surveys or data matching to match with third-parties and platforms (our partners).
We include contractual safeguards to ensure that you will not automatically be targeted for commercial purposes, as a result of your data being used to help create a lookalike audience, and that our partners cannot use your data for any other purpose.
Persistent unique identifier, contact details, email address, social login, cookie, IP address, mobile device ID, official identification number (i.e. ME number)
Ad Exposure and Measurement
In addition to cookie-based matching (which you can control and consent to via your panel account), we will use personal data you provide to us, such as email address, in a direct matching process with third parties (our clients and partners) to determine if you are a user of that service (such as social networks, websites, mobile apps) for advertising measurement research purposes. We will identify what advertisements you may have been exposed to on those sites and platforms and measure how brand attitudes or brand recall have impacted sales. The third parties that we work with are not allowed to use the data for any other purpose.
Persistent unique identifier, contact details, email address, social login, cookie, IP address, mobile device ID, official identification number (i.e. ME number)
Our third-party partners are all contractually bound to keep any information they collect and disclose to us, or that we collect and disclose to them, confidential and must protect it with security standards and practices that are equivalent to our own.
3.Where We Store Your Personal Data
For personal data which is subject to the GDPR and transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we shall put adequate safeguards in place to ensure the transfer is made by a lawful method for the purposes of EU data protection law and secure. For data which is not subject to the GDPR, Lightspeed shall strictly follow any other applicable data protection laws.
Lightspeed’s data storage servers are located in Europe and in the United States of America (USA) and are managed by third party service providers in the cloud.
We take appropriate technological and organisational measures to protect your personal data, both during transmission and once we receive it. Our security procedures are consistent with generally accepted standards used to protect personal data.

Lightspeed will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email.  Also, please remember to sign out of your Panels account and close your browser window when you have finished visiting our site. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal data and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe. Please change your password regularly.

Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal data, Lightspeed cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable steps to ensure our systems are secure.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

5.Cookie Disclosure
Cookies are small text files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website that assigns a numerical user ID and stores certain information about your online browsing. They are used to help users navigate websites efficiently and perform certain functions. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file on the user��s computer or mobile device. Every time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server.
For behavioural tracking research, we use optional cookies / software applications, but only if you have given your consent to these cookies / applications.
As is true of most online surveys, we gather certain information automatically and store it in survey data files. This information may include things like Internet Protocol addresses (IP address), browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”); referring/exit pages, operating system and date/time stamp.
We use this automatically collected information to analyse trends such as browser usage and to administer the site, e.g. to optimise the survey experience depending on your browser type. We may also use your IP address to check whether there have been multiple participations in the survey from this IP address and also to protect our business against fraudulent behaviour.
Lightspeed defines cookies within 3 categories:
Required to use the Panels site
Security-specific
Behavioural or advertising research cookies
For more information, please log in and access your cookie preferences page where you are able to adjust your cookie settings.
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as ‘clickstream data’, may be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the web site from which you linked to the Site. We may collect and use clickstream data as aggregated information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our site, how visitors navigate throughout the site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our site and our services. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and will not intentionally contain any personal data.
6.Accuracy
We take reasonable steps to keep personal data in our possession or control accurate, complete and current, based on the most recent information made available to us by you and/or by our client.
We rely on you to help us keep your personal data accurate, complete and current by answering our questions honestly. You are responsible for ensuring that you notify us of any changes to your personal data.
7.Children’s Data
Lightspeed recognizes the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal data collected from children. We never knowingly invite children under the legal age set by the authorities in the country in which you reside to participate in research studies without parental permission. If it is necessary and appropriate to a particular project to directly involve children under the legal age, we take measures to ensure we have been given permission by their parent or legal guardian. Lightspeed will provide parents and guardians information about the survey topic, about any personal or sensitive information which may be collected from the children, the way this data will be used and whether and with whom Lightspeed may share such information.
While the child is completing the survey, it is the responsibility of the parent or guardian to supervise them.
8.Sensitive Data
From time to time, Lightspeed may collect personal data that is classified as “special categories” of personal data.  This includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.   You can choose whether or not to provide this data to us.
9.Rights of Individuals

You may be able to access your personal data held by these third parties and correct, amend or delete it where it is inaccurate.
10.Data Storage and Retention
Personal data will be retained only for such period as is appropriate for its intended and lawful use. Lightspeed will retain your personal data for as long as you are a member of the Panels. In case you unsubscribe from the Panels, we shall retain data for no longer than 3 months after you unsubscribe, unless otherwise required by law. Personal data that is no longer required will be disposed of in ways that ensure their confidential nature is not compromised.
As part of the Company Business Continuity Plan and as required by ISO 27001, ISO 9001, ISO 20252 and in certain instances the law, our electronic systems are backed up and archived. These archives are retained for a defined period of time in a strictly controlled environment. Once expired, the data is deleted and destroyed to ensure the data is erased completely.
11.Notification of Material Change
We reserve the right to change, add to, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time. You should read this page regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. However, if any material change is made to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of that change. Non-material changes to this Privacy Policy will be announced through the Panels’ sites only.
