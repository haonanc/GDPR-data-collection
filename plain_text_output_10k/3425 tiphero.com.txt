We provide such information to companies affiliated with Tip Hero, as well as other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
Access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is necessary in order to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. It is also necessary to enforce applicable Terms of Use, as well as to investigate any potential violations and abuses of the Terms of Use. In addition, we may need to use this information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Finally, we use this information to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Tip Hero, its users, and the public as required or permitted by law.
If Tip Hero becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will make every reasonable effort to provide notice of such a change before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We may, from time-to-time, share with third parties certain pieces of personal information in the aggregate. For example, we may share information related to the number of website visitors who searched for a particular event or clicked on a particular website. Such information does not identify you individually.
We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

These individuals may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.
