Welcome to Handshake, a career services platform that connects students and employers to democratize the job finding experience,       in college and beyond. From the very beginning, our goal has been to design privacy into our platform in a way that       respects the rights of students, the obligations of Universities, and the needs of employers. We understand that student       data privacy is a hot topic these days so we want to make clear the very basic privacy principles that guide our policies       and practices:
Students are in complete control of what data they make public. We give students control over whether they want to make their profile public to employers and what information they share           on it. No student data uploaded to Handshake is ever viewable by any employer until a student has chosen to make           their profile public.
Universities choose the student data they share with Handshake. We respect the rights of students regarding their own personal data, and we are proud to work with Universities to find the           best ways to maximize their career center’s value without compromising student privacy.
Handshake will never sell personal student data. We have never done it and we never will! Our business model is based on offering valuable tools for our student and employer           users that enhance the career discovery process. Your email address and personal data will never be sold to any           third party.
You should read our full Privacy Policy to understand what data we collect, how we use it, and the limited circumstances       where we may share it. Please note if that you reside in the EU or other regions outside the US, information collected       through our Service will be transferred to and processed in the US or elsewhere. While Handshake participates in the       EU/US Privacy Shield program as described below, these locations may not have the same data protection laws as the       country in which you initially used our Services. By using our Services, you consent to any transfer and processing       in accordance with this Policy. If you have any questions, please contact us at privacy@joinhandshake.com.
