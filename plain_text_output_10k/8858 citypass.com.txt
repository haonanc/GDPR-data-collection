Data protection laws allow us to collect, use and retain your personal information if we have a proper reason to do so. These reasons include:
When you consent to it,
To fulfill a contractual relationship with you, such as fulfilling your order,

Personal Information means any personally identifiable information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.  When we use the term "personally identifiable information," we mean information that is directly associated with, or could be used to identify, a specific person or to determine preferences, interests, behavior, location or movement to create or use in a personal profile. Examples of information we may collect includes a name, address, telephone/cell number, email address, internet protocol address (IP address), mobile device identifier, or information about activities directly linked to that person which would permit the physical or online tracking or contacting of that person.
Usage Information.  We also collect additional information regarding users’ activities on our Website.  For instance, when you view a section of our Website that does not require you to log in with unique user credentials or start conversations with us, we may collect anonymous Usage Information that may not reasonably be used to identify you as the source.

Third-Party Use: CityPASS does not disclose, share or sell personally identifiable information to third-parties or non-affiliate entities for their use independent of the products we provide. There are two limited exceptions to this policy that apply to users who purchase our products: 1) We use a third-party global identity and fraud verification vendor, Whitepages Pro . For the purpose of fraud detection, we use information you give us including, name, address, email address and phone number, in order to match the information with information Whitepages Pro has collected from other sources and stored in its database. To facilitate verification of future transactions through CityPASS or other vendors, Whitepages Pro may update its database to reflect that the information you provided to CityPASS and we shared with Whitepages Pro matched information in its database. Whitepages Pro may also update its database to include new information you provided to CityPASS and we shared with Whitepages Pro, which was not previously found in Whitepages Pro’s database. You can review Whitepages Pro’s privacy policy by following this link, Whitepages Pro Privacy Policy . 2) We also use a third-party fraud verification vendor, Kount .

Potential Future Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information
Business Transfers: Information about our users and customers, including personally identifiable information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, or sale of company assets.

Our Use of "Cookies"
Our use of cookies is described in detail in our Cookie Policy .
Your right to access, copy or erase your personal information
For qualifying citizens of the European Union (EU), this section provides details about your rights in relation to your ability to access and to transfer personal information.
For qualifying citizens in the EU, you may ask us to:
Provide access to all the personal information about you held by us. If you ask us to do so, we will provide you with a copy of this information. For the first request, we will provide an electronic copy of the data at no charge. For subsequent requests, or printed copies, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or taking the action requested. You can exercise your right of access to your personal information:
By emailing us at privacyofficer@citypass.com ; or
By writing to us at the address below.
Please note that we may be required to ask you for further information in order to confirm your identity before we provide the information requested.
Correct or erase your personal information where appropriate. Please note, you may review and update or correct your user profile information by logging in, as applicable, to the relevant portions of your CityPASS account profile where such information may be updated or corrected;
Restrict the processing of your personal information while we investigate your concern;
You have a right to receive your information in a commonly used electronic format or ask us to move the data in that format to another provider where your request relates to the data that you gave us directly and where technically possible (data portability); and
Withdraw your consent at any time when the processing relies upon consent. Provided, however, if processing of a purchase of products or services has been completed, then cancellation of the purchase shall be subject to the terms and conditions for the purchase at the time it was made.  In other words, you are not permitted to withdraw your consent to process your information in an effort to rescind an otherwise non-refundable purchase.
For qualifying citizens in the EU, this section provides details about your rights in relation to your ability to access and to transfer personal information.
In the event you ask us to erase your personal information, it is in our reasonable interest to maintain some of the information for a reasonable period of time to complete the processing of your order, the delivery of our services to you to verify that the transaction placed for you was not fraudulent, or to enable the use of your purchased products.  We may also keep a log or a record sufficient to demonstrate that we sent your information to you or fulfilled your request to erase your data. The log or record is in our reasonable interest to document compliance with various privacy laws, rules and regulations.
Further, in the event you ask us to erase your data, certain third-party software we use is not designed to entirely remove information from software or systems without impairing the software’s functionality. It is in our reasonable interest to maintain the integrity of our software and operating systems. If that is the case, we will take steps to erase your data by making your data unreadable, thereby rendering it anonymous and untraceable. For example, we may change all letters to hash marks (“#”) or other symbols and numbers to zeros (“0”) to effectively erase your information.
If you choose not to give personal information
You can choose not to give us personal information, but it may prevent us from providing our services to you. In this section we explain the effects this may have.
We may need to collect personal information to enter into or fulfill a contract we have with you.
If you choose not to give us your personal information, it may also mean that we cannot complete a purchase or deliver our products or services to you.
We sometimes ask for information that is useful, but not required by law to process your order. We will make this clear when we ask for it. You do not have to give us these extra details and it won't affect the products or services you have with us. For example, we may ask you if you wish to subscribe to our newsletter. You are not required to do so in order to obtain our products and services.
