Privacy Policy
We respect the privacy of the personal information you give us, such                as your name, street address, telephone number and e-mail address,                and other personal information you may provide. The following               policy  is intended to explain how we treat this information. This               policy  may change from time to time.
Traffic  data
Each time a visitor comes to our web site, our servers collect some                basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor's                domain name (i.e., the ISP from which the user is logged on). We                use software to keep track of traffic to our sites and derive such                information as the location from which the traffic originates and                which particular pages within the site are being viewed. After we                analyze this information, we discard it. We may aggregate information                about visitors and traffic and may share the results with advertisers.                We will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable                data that you supply us without your permission. It will only be                used for us to contact you.
Use of Cookies
A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser                from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We make limited use of cookies to keep track of your visits to our site and to                 facilitate the logging in process for registered users.
Other companies that place advertising on our site also have the                ability to assign their cookies to you if you visit their sites.               This is a process that we do not control.
Additionally, we use  services which employ cookies to gather  3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests), interest-based advertising or information. We do not participate in personally-identifiable information nor do we merge information to build such data repositories.
E-bulletins
If you sign up to receive  e-bulletins from PaloAltoOnline.com,                   you may also receive infrequent other announcements from                   us. Users can choose to unsubscribe from any new mailing lists                   we create (opt-out) at any time by following the unsubscribe             instructions found in each e-mail.
Site Registration
If you sign up to become a member of PaloAltoOnline.com,             your personally identifiable information (such as name, address, phone number, email address) will be stored in our database. We will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable              data that you supply us without your permission, except as required by law.
Surveys
We may conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to collect certain demographic      information. This information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers      and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific      individuals. We may use the e-mail address you provided us for the distribution of other      announcements. Users can choose to unsubscribe (opt-out) from any mailing lists we create at    any time by following the unsubscribe instructions found in each e-mail.
Contests
We may sponsor contests or other events from time to time that require the collection,      processing and storage of certain contact and demographic information (e.g., place of residence) for use as part of the contest. Sometimes these contests may be jointly sponsored      with companies. In that case the user's contact and other information will be shared with      the other company only if it is expressly stated in the rules of the contest.
However, such contests will include the option to receive e-mail                  from our partners regarding their products or services. If you                 sign  up for such an e-mail list, we will release your e-mail address                  to our partner for the purpose of such mailings, and only for                 that  purpose. We will not release any of your other personal information                  to that partner. If you do not sign up for such an e-mail list,                  our partners will receive no information on you  including                   your e-mail address  even if you enter the associated contest                 or promotion.
We retain the right to use your e-mail address collected for the distribution      of other announcements. Users can choose to unsubscribe (opt-out) from any      mailing lists we create at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions      found in each e-mail.
Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is important to                     us. For that reason, we will not collect or maintain information                     at our Web site from those actually known to be under 13.                     The sole exception to this is our mailing lists. If a child                     under 13 signs up for our newsletter or any of our mailing                     lists, they will remain a member unless we are asked to remove                     them by their parent or legal guardian, or they elect to                     opt-out themselves.
Security
We take precautions to protect your information both online and offline. All of our sites use SHA-256 encrypted SSL Certificates. When we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), the information is encrypted and transmitted in a secure way. Users can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
Further, we do not store credit card data in our database. PaloAltoOnline.com uses a third party provider (Braintree, https://www.braintreepayments.com ) as our vault for storage of such data for our Websites. We never see the data, as it's passed directly to the provider, nor do we have a way of seeing the full information once it's encrypted.
Other Disclosure of Personal Information
We will not otherwise disclose or make use of personal information               without consent of the user except (i) as described in this privacy               policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order or as requested               by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does               not protect information you post to any online bulletin board,               chat room, newsgroup, reviews or other public forum within our sites.
Other Sites
Our sites contain links to sites on the Internet operated by                 others. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy             practices or content of such other Web sites.
Unsubscribe and Data Removal Policies
If you would like to unsubscribe from any mailing list, please               follow the instructions at the bottom of the mailing list itself.                If you want to remove your name                and e-mail address from any of our mailing lists, you can send               an  e-mail requesting removal to webmaster@PaloAltoOnline.com . Please include which list you               are asking to be removed from.
