When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk. For certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below).
Some of Blizzard’s products, services and features require that we share information with other users, our partners and service providers, or for legal reasons or in the event of a dispute.
1. With partners and service providers. Blizzard may provide information to its vendors, consultants, marketing partners, research firms and other service providers or business partners. For example, we may provide information to such parties to help facilitate event ticket sales, conduct surveys on our behalf and process payments for our products and/or games.
2. With other players and/or the general public. Information may be viewable by your friends, people in games, or the public in general if you play our games, use certain features in our games, use certain features on our platforms (such as chat applications in game or on the Battle.net platform) or make posts in the forums.

Blizzard may share your information if we believe it is required by applicable law, regulation, operating agreement, legal process or governmental request. This includes sharing your information with law enforcement officials, government authorities or other third parties as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, user agreements or other policies to protect Blizzard’s rights or property or the rights or property of others, or in the event of a claim or dispute relating to your use of our services.
Your personal data will be transferred to and processed in the [United States] where many of our central databases operate. The European Commission has not issued a decision confirming the United States to offer adequate protection for personal data. However, we use European Commission approved contract clauses to protect your personal data. Where we share data with vendors, we use these clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules to protect your data.  A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to our Data Protection Officer using the details set out below.

Blizzard and our partners, such as marketing partners ( listed here ), may use tracking technologies like cookies, beacons, tags, scripts and unique codes used in apps. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the websites or apps, tracking users’ movements around the websites or apps and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as an aggregated, basis.
We use this technology for various purposes, including our shopping cart, maintenance of user settings (e.g. language preference) and authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your ability to use some of the features or areas of our websites may be limited.
We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personal data.
We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies and Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage Flash cookies, please click here .
We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Some of these ad networks are members of the Networking Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) – organizations who offer a single location to opt out of receiving tailored ads. If you wish not to have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by visiting the  DAA's Consumer Choice page  and/or the  NAI’s Consumer Opt-Out page . Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic, or non-targeted, ads. Please also note that we strive to adhere to the  DAA's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising .
An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your computer. Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.
11. What level of security is applied to your personal information?
To help protect the privacy of the data and personally identifiable information you provide to us and that we learn from you, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of personal information. We restrict access to your personal data to those employees indicated above. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.
12. Note to Parents
We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission when they are on-line.
Once a child states that his/her age is under 16, he or she will be unable to register an account with us. We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s personal information, they may request the deletion of the information by contacting us at EU-Privacy@Blizzard.com .
Blizzard has engineered Parental Controls to help parents monitor and limit, if necessary, the amount of time their children spend interacting with our games. For more information, you may visit our Parental Controls area at BattleNet Support .
13. Further Information or Complaints
If you have questions or concerns regarding data protection at Blizzard, you may contact our Data Protection Officer by writing to DPO@Blizzard.com .
Each EU Member State shall provide one or more independent public authority (ies) to be responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR in order to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to processing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the Union (‘supervisory authority’). If you feel that Blizzard has violated your rights, or if you wish to raise a concern with the data protection authorities, please contact the supervisory authority in the country where you live, work, or where you believe a breach of data protection law has occurred.
