Last updated: September 2016
2006 Update: Provided updated information regarding information security and online privacy.
2012 Update: The 2012 updates were designed to connect privacy compliance efforts in all Mary Kay markets around the world, and to provide consumers, Independent Beauty Consultants, employees and others who may visit our websites with a central location from which they can obtain information about our policies and their rights with regard to personal information. These changes also included updates in compliance with changes to laws in many of the countries in which Mary Kay has operations. 
2016 Update:  The 2016 updates are related to the adoption of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.
At Mary Kay, we understand the importance of privacy.  Our most important goal is to protect, collect and use personal information provided to us in the spirit of one of our most important founding principles -- the Golden Rule. Your choice with regard to your personal information is important to us and we will use and maintain information only in ways you have allowed. Therefore, we do not trade, sell or lease personal information entrusted to us. This Global Privacy Statement describes how we work to maintain your trust.
We strive to be consistent in how we implement privacy policies across the globe. Our privacy policies are designed to comply with the law in each country where we do business and apply to:
All individuals who provide personal information, such as Independent Beauty Consultants, consumers, customers, research subjects, business partners, shareholders, job applicants, employees, retirees, and others; 
All countries where we operate, even where local regulations do not exist; 
 
Mary Kay manages privacy through our Global Privacy Team, representing all geographic regions where we do business and business processes where personal information is collected—such as from Independent Beauty Consultants, consumer promotions, and employee programs. Mary Kay seeks to promote and utilize industry best practices to ensure privacy concerns are addressed and that personal information is protected.
Our privacy policies are designed to model internationally accepted privacy principles, or fair information practices, such as those established by the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. https://www.privacyshield.gov
Mary Kay has certified that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov .  These principles and how Mary Kay works to apply them are:
Why We Collect Information
Mary Kay collects and uses personal information to provide an incredible business opportunity, fabulous products, and services of superior quality for Independent Beauty Consultants and their customers, consumers of our products and services, employees, and others who may come into contact with Mary Kay. We limit the collection of personal information to what we need to know in order to achieve our goal of providing superior quality, value and opportunities. For example, we use e-mail addresses to send Independent Beauty Consultants, consumers, employees and job applicants information they have requested. Independent Beauty Consultant and consumer feedback on products and services is used to improve those products and services.
Notice
We tell individuals what information we collect, how it is used, whether it may be transferred to others to provide the products or services requested, and how to contact the Company or the Mary Kay Privacy Team with inquiries. We provide a link to our Privacy Policies on our websites, and provide additional targeted privacy notices to users who may need additional information about different areas on our websites when appropriate.
Choice
We offer individuals who provide us information choices about receiving further communications from us. Our emails and newsletters are sent only to those who have asked to receive them from us or when requested to be sent to you by an Independent Beauty Consultant. Our communications tell you how to unsubscribe or “opt-out” of receiving future communications. We may ask individuals if they wish to participate in market research, and then contact them if they give us their permission.
Technology
Mary Kay uses technology in order to better serve Independent Beauty Consultants, consumers, employees, and others. We tell individuals when we use technologies that are privacy related. We use internet cookies to collect and store personal information and provide you notice of their use, seeking permission when necessary, depending on the country in which you reside.
Access
Mary Kay takes steps to make sure that the personal information we use is correct. We provide individuals with reasonable access to the personal information they've provided us so that they can review and correct it, or ask us not to use it.
Security
Mary Kay protects personal information under company control by industry standard security practices and measures in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration of the information. We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need for such information. We do not keep personal information any longer than necessary to meet the business purpose for which it was collected unless contractual, legal or regulatory reasons require that personal information not be deleted for certain time periods.
Data Transfer
We may transfer personal information to Mary Kay databases in countries other than where it was provided. Our Global Privacy Program requires the same high level of security and protection of personal information in all countries with procedures and contracts in place to help ensure this is so. Data may be transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for Mary Kay and/or Independent Beauty Consultants. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards as Mary Kay. They cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services you, Mary Kay or your Independent Beauty Consultant has requested.
Children
Mary Kay does not intend to collect information from children under the age of 14, or such other age as designated by a country specific law. We ask for age confirmation on our websites before collecting personal information to make sure we do not collect information from children.
Accountability
Mary Kay expects our employees and partners to maintain the trust placed in us by those who give us personal information. We provide privacy training to employees and highlight the importance of privacy in our worldwide business conduct program. Those who manage personal information complete privacy self-assessments to make sure that personal information is secure and protected. We periodically audit privacy compliance. 
Mary Kay privacy policies and data protection practices extend by contract to our supplier and partner relationships. We support industry self-regulation as a flexible means for keeping pace with emerging privacy issues.

Data Transfer
We may transfer personal information to Mary Kay databases in countries other than where it was provided. Our Global Privacy Program requires the same high level of security and protection of personal information in all geographies with procedures and contracts in place to help ensure this is so. Data may be transferred to a vendor or business partner to provide services for Mary Kay, such as mailing information or samples. These vendors and business partners are required to protect and manage the personal information to the same high standards Mary Kay does, and they cannot use the information for purposes other than to provide the services Mary Kay has requested.
Security
Mary Kay protects personal information under company control by industry standard security practices and measures, in order to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or alteration of the information. We limit access to personal information to those who have a business need for such information. We do not keep personal information any longer than necessary to meet the business purpose for which it was collected, though in some cases, contractual, legal or regulatory reasons require that personal information not be deleted for certain time periods.
