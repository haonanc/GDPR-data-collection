By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
We collect personal information about you from various sources to provide our services to you, to analyze and improve our services, and to communicate with you. To help you understand how we use and share this information, this Privacy Policy describes our data privacy and confidentiality practices.
We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and no personally identifiable information is shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, by lawful request of public authorities and national security or law enforcement requirements, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if 15Five is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, 15Five will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Information gathering and usage
When you register for 15Five we ask for information such as your name, company name, email address, billing address, credit card information. Members who sign up for a free trial are not required to enter a credit card.
15Five uses collected information for the following general purposes: products and services provision, billing, identification and authentication, services improvement, contact, and research.
15Five may also use non-personally identifiable data submitted by Users to create and provide new services, features or content. For example, and without limitation, we may use data like employee pulse trends rates to publish interesting observations for informational or marketing purposes. 15Five will anonymize such data such that neither users nor Subscribing Organizations are identified.
15Five may internally perform statistical and other analysis on information we collect (including usage data, device data, referral data, and information from page tags) to analyze and measure user behavior and trends, to understand how people use our services, to monitor, troubleshoot and improve our services, and to create and provide new services, features or content.
When you access our Service by or through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a Unique Device Identifier (“UDID”), Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), device type, model and manufacturer, and mobile device operating system brand and model.
Cookies
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.
Cookies are required to use the 15Five service.
We use cookies to record current session information, but do not use permanent cookies. You are required to log-in to your 15Five after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.
We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our visitors. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time, as we believe that there is no consistent industry standard for how to respond to Do Not Track browser settings.
Data storage
15Five uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run 15Five. Although 15Five owns the code, databases, and all rights to the 15Five application, you retain all rights to your data.

Consistent with this Privacy Policy, 15Five may also disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the Terms of Service.
