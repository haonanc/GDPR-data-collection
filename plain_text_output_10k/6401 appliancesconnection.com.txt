We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies.  We use session  cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie  expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard  drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by  following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

[Explain how cookies are used on your website.] Cookies are used on our site to keep track of the referring website, your recent history and to maintain any items that are placed in your shopping cart for your convenience. We set  a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more  than once.  Persistent cookies also  enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the  experience on our site. If you  reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas  of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited.
The use of cookies by our  partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not  covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or  control over these cookies.

Web Beacons / Gifs
We employ [or our third party advertising partner  employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),  that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is  effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics  with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track  the online movements of web  users.  In contrast to cookies, which are  stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages  and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do  not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally  identifiable information. The clear gifs used on this site are used to report order total and item sales for tallying.
Safe Shopping Guarantee
We   guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means   you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of   shopping at AppliancesConnection.Com. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your   bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your   bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire   liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if   the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own   from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized   use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card issuer in accordance   with its reporting rules and procedures.
Transactional Information
We make every effort to ensure that your  purchase experience at AppliancesConnection.Com is secure. We use state-of-the-art data encryption technology to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your user information. Secure Socket Layers (SSLs) encrypt the information sent between your computer and our database. In addition, we use Internet fraud screening to protect credit card transactions. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
To be sure you're browsing secure pages, check your web browser status bar (located at the bottom of the window) for the closed padlock icon. This icon appears in the latest versions of Internet Explorer and Firefix to tell you that you are viewing a secure web page. Also, all browsers display an "s" after the "http" (https://) in the website address to indicate that you're in a secure environment.
We also protect your purchase by preventing the shipment of   merchandise to a fraudulent address. All billing addresses are verified   electronically and all alternate shipping addresses are verified manually. Any   customer shipping to an address that differs from the billing address must put   this alternate address on file with his or her credit card company. We then call   the credit card issuer to verify that the customer has indeed put the   information on file.
Product Testimonials
Our website also offers publicly accessible product  testimonials. You should be aware that any information you provide in these  areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request  removal of your personal information from the product testimonial please  contact us at.  In some cases, we may not  be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know  if we are unable to do so and why.
Tell-a-Friend
If you choose to tell a friend about a product, we  will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your friend a  one-time email inviting them to look at the product.  AppliancesConnection does not  store this information and is only used for the sole  purpose of sending this one-time email. Your  friend may contact us at info@AppliancesConnection.com to  request that we remove this information from our database.

Our website  includes social media features,  such as the Facebook Like button and widgets,  such as the ShareThis button or interactive  mini-programs that run on our site. These features  may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may  set a cookie to enable the feature to  function properly. Social media features  and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.
