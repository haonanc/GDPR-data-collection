We use the Beauty Profile information to personalize your experience.

We ask for your date of birth to make sure you're old enough to use our Site and services.  And, of course, we also like to wish you a happy birthday.
If you provide us your email address but choose not to become a member, then we will retain your email address for a period of time to invite you back to the Site.

If you order products through ipsy Shop or our ipsy shopper app, your name, shipping address, and email address will be shared with our Retail Partners, whose products you are purchasing. Please review the privacy policy for that Retail Partner before providing your information. You may find a list of our Retail Partners here.
We use the this information, along with your email, for billing purposes, to fulfill your orders, and to communicate with you about your orders.
We collect your credit card information through our Site. The credit card information is encrypted, and transmitted for storage to a high security vault according to strict industry standards.

Instead we retain a token associated with your account that has no intrinsic value. Your credit card information is not exposed anywhere in our own systems.  Please do not send your credit card information to our team directly, for example by emailing this information to an ipsyCare representative.  Please use our secure, online system to enter your credit card information.
When You Request Information from Us. If you want us to notify you regarding particular products or special offers, or if you sign up for our emails, you'll need to give us your email address.

When You Post Public Content. We use this content to bring our community of fabulous ipsters to life.
Public information you post on the Site. Information you post publicly on our Site is intended for public consumption.

Please note that if you are a minor, living in California, and you have posted information publicly that you cannot remove yourself, you have the right to request it be hidden from public view.  If you wish to have this information removed, please email us at privacy@ipsy.com and request removal. We may request additional information from you in order to complete your request.

We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.

You can change your username and profile picture at any time by logging into your account.
Public information you post on other sites. We also may collect information you post publicly on third-party sites, but only if you choose to follow instructions we provide.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies Policy.
Introduction
We use a variety of technologies to help us understand how you use ipsy.com our ipsy apps, and our services (collectively, "ipsy").  This guide explains the tracking technologies ipsy uses and is part of our commitment to a high standard of transparency in our privacy practices.
Types of tracking technologies
Cookies. This is a small data file sent from a server to your web browser that is stored in your browser and sent back to the server each time the browser makes a request to the server.  Cookies can improve a site user's experience by, for example, allowing the site to keep a user logged in while browsing, saving a user's site preferences, and allowing a user to add items to a shopping cart and preserve cart contents between site visits, even when the user is not logged in.
Clear gifs, web beacons, tracking pixels. These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier. They function similarly to cookies and are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded on web pages and are single pixel wide. ipsy does not tie information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information.
If you have turned on location services in your mobile device, we may collect information about your geolocation.  If you do not want us to collect this information, you may turn off location services on your smart phone.   Turning off location services will not affect your ability to access the app, but you may not be able to access certain geolocation based promotions that ipsy may offer from time to time.
Tracking Technology Lifespans
Single-session tracking technology:  lasts only as long as your site visit. Single-session cookies expire and delete themselves when you leave the site or close your browser. They are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation through a site or generating aggregated statistics about how a site is used. Single-session cookies do not publicly expose your personal information.
Multi-session or persistent tracking technology:  remains on your browser or mobile device until you choose to delete it or the cookie expires. Persistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited a site. This can improve the user's experience, for example by continuing preference settings from previous visits and by allowing users to login without entering a password with every site visit.
Tracking Purposes
We use tracking technologies for these general purposes:
Because it is strictly necessary.  This tracking is needed to make ipsy work properly.
For performance.  This tracking helps ipsy understand how the Site is functioning so ipsy can improve the Site.
For functionality.  This tracking retains your personal preferences as you use the Site.
For advertising.  This tracking gathers data to help deliver advertising to you that interests you.
Cookies ipsy currently uses
Single session cookies are used to ensure the Site displays correctly on your device.
Persistent cookies are used to measure Site metrics such as which pages are popular, how often people visit the Site, whether people are visiting the Site for the first time, and whether visitors make purchases on the Site.  They also are used to enhance Site functionality, for example to allow returning users to use the Site without logging in.
Cookies for email subscribers
We may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our email communications and to tailor email content. For example, we may connect the data showing that you clicked a link in an email from ipsy then completed an action on our Site such as buying a Glam Bag.  This links cookie data with an individual user, so we only do this for users who have consented and opted in to receiving emails from ipsy.
Third Party Cookies
ipsy partners with third-party service providers who set cookies and tracking pixels for Site visitors and members on our behalf in order to deliver their services. These services include targeted online marketing and analysis of data collected through cookies. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you visit ipsy.com or other sites that also utilize the third party's services, but do not allow access to personally identifiable information from ipsy.
Third parties may choose to include ipsy widgets on their sites. When you load a site that has chosen to include our widgets, we receive analytics information through a cookie that may be used to enhance our data or to improve our services.
ipsy does not have access to or control over these third-party technologies, and they are not covered by our Privacy Policy.
Managing Cookies
You can delete cookies stored in your browser at any time.  You also can choose not to accept cookies from any site, including ipsy.com, by changing the settings of your browser.  If you reject or block all cookies in your browser settings, then you will not be able to fully use ipsy's services.
ipsy does not currently act on "do not track" request headers.

HOW WE MAY DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT OR RECEIVE
Information we collect from you may be either personal or aggregate.

Aggregate Information. We use aggregate information for the purposes of internal business research, sales and business development and reporting back to our brand partners.  We may share aggregated information about our visitor and user base with third parties such as our advertising partners.  This information may include the number of daily visitors to our Site and the number of orders placed on a certain date.  We also may share Beauty Profile information with brand partners.

Our servers are hosted at locations which are private and secure data center facilities, behind physical and virtual firewalls.
