This Privacy Policy applies to Breastcancer.org and Breasthealth.org, owned and operated by Breastcancer.org. This Privacy Policy describes how Breastcancer.org (“We”, “Us”, “Our”) collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information.
If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request .
Please note that you are authorized to use this web site only if you agree to this Privacy Statement, and your use of this web site constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Statement.
1. Information You Choose to Provide
Breastcancer.org collects personally identifiable information only from our users who choose to provide it. We do so at several different points on our web site, for example:
at the Community sign up
at the Booklets and Brochures By Mail request page
at the subscription point for the Breastcancer.org email updates
at the online credit card acceptance form
when you contact Breastcancer.org by email, either to ask questions or to submit your ideas or suggestions
We may use the information you provide to deliver the services you have requested, for example:
if you sign up for our Community and elect to make your email address available to us, we may send you email regarding Community changes or questions about your Discussion Board postings.
NOTE: Users should be aware that choosing a username that allows personal identification, or disclosing personally identifiable information when posting messages to the Discussion Boards makes the information submitted public. Such disclosure may increase the chance of receiving "spam" or unsolicited email.
if you request free printed booklets, we may use the name and postal mailing address you provide to mail you the booklets you request.
if you provide your email address in connection with an order, we may send you email confirmation of your order.
if you send us a question by email, we may use the email address you provide to respond to your question.
if you elect to add your address to our mailing list, we may send you informational materials and notice of special events at Breastcancer.org.
if you wish to subscribe to our email updates, we will use the email address you provide to send you email updates.
if you purchase a product or other service, we may use the credit card information you provide to bill you for the product or service you have requested.
if you choose to contribute to Breastcancer.org, we may use the information you provide to process the transaction. We may also mail you updates on our programs and support offerings. You may also receive future solicitations for donations to support these programs and offerings.
The profile you create on our site will be publicly accessible unless otherwise indicated. You may change the privacy settings of your profile through your account portal.
We may also use the information you provide to operate and maintain the Breastcancer.org web site and to improve our content, services, and communications with you.
If you are visiting our web site from a country outside the United States, you acknowledge and agree that in using this web site, you will transfer personal information about yourself to the United States, that the data protection laws of the United States may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country and that the transfer of this personal information occurs with your consent.
2. Information Collected Automatically
Breastcancer.org also collects routine tracking information as users move through the site, through the use of IP addresses, cookies, and web beacons, explained in more detail below.
We and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the web site, track users' movements around the web site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.
We use cookies to track aggregate user statistics on the site to help us determine how people move throughout the site, which areas are popular, and which links are unpopular or hard to see. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
Log Files
As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. "IP addresses" are the equivalent of internet "mailing addresses." They tell other computers on the Internet where to send the information you have requested, such as new web pages or images. 
Behavioral Targeting/Re-Targeting
We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here . Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.
3. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties for marketing purposes, without your consent. If you do not want to share your personal information with these companies, contact us here .
We may share your personally identifiable information with our authorized service providers, for example, those who process credit card transactions for us, or handle our email, or support our web site functionality. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
In certain situations, Breastcancer.org may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet law enforcement requirements. We may disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a subpoena, court order, similar legal process or in response to a request from a law enforcement or other government agency, to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against claims.
We reserve the right to transfer all personally identifiable information in our possession to a successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition or a sale of all or a part of our assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
If you opt-in to receive marketing and promotional communications from us or from our sponsors, your identity and contact information (but no medical information) may be used to send you messages about products or services that may be of interest to you. At any time, you can “opt out” of receiving promotional email messages, or having your identity and contact information provided to our sponsors, by contacting us at comments@breastcancer.org . It may take us ten (10) days to process your request. Even after opting out, you may continue to receive email from third parties to whom your address was provided before you opted out. You will be responsible for contacting these third parties directly, to request that they stop sending you promotional email.
We may send you messages regarding your subscription, an order or a contribution by you, or other transactional or relationship messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and sponsors. Partners can include providers of content and services, such as the American Cancer Society, as well as financial sponsors. The aggregate demographic information we share is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
