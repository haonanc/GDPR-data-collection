When you visit this Web site we may collect and store, either directly or through the use of a third party tracking system, the IP address of the computer making the request (this may not be the IP address of your personal computer, but the IP address assigned to your Internet connection by your Internet service provider or company network); the URL that is being requested; the date and time of the request; the browser type and operating system used to make the request; and the referring URL.

Cookies.  We may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to track your use of our Web sites. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server and stored by the user's Web browser so the information can later be read back from that browser. Cookies enable the browser to identify itself to the server, and allow the server to maintain an active "session" with an individual user. Cookies help the browser remember some specific information about you, such as your origination information and your product and service preferences. We use cookies to store these identifiers, which allow us to authenticate you when you visit the Web site. These identifiers also allow us to  personalize and facilitate delivery of our products and services to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by this Web site but does not cover the use of cookies by our third-party tracking service.
Web Beacons.  Web beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. We use web beacons to improve your experience on our Web Sites, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that we can deliver relevant content and offers. Our web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).
Decline Cookies.  Your Web browser may be set to accept cookies automatically, but can be changed to decline them.  The Help section of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to set your browser to prevent accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Please note that if you decline to accept cookies, the functionality of myFICO and Free FICO Score Web sites will be very limited: you will not be able to log into your account or purchase products.

Your Opt-Out Choices
With respect to Personal Information, we do not honor electronic do-not-track signals sent by your browser when you visit our site or other mechanisms that would give you the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of Personal Information about your online activities over time and across third party Web sites, but you have the ability to opt out of certain types of information sharing and communications. You may tell us not to:
 
 
Solicit you by mail, telephone or e-mail for products and services that are not directly related to your account and that are outside our regular communications with you (such as your monthly statement, customer service e-mails or when you call our customer service center). If you tell us not to solicit you, we will not disclose information about you within our corporate group of companies for that purpose. You may opt out of receiving these communications and information when you create your myFICO and/or free FICO score account by following the instruction for opting out of the communication programs. You may also opt out at any time by logging into your account at www.myFICO.com and/or www.FreeFICOScore.com , clicking on "Contact Preferences", and editing your preferences to opt out of the communication programs. If you receive an email from us you may opt out of further email communications by following the opt-out link contained in the email. (NV residents: you may also contact the Attorney General at 100 N Carson St. Carson City, NV 89701-4717 or by telephone at 775-684-1100.)
Please note that your decision to opt out will not apply to certain disclosures that are required for us to deliver the Products you have ordered or that are specifically permitted or required by law. For example, the Products cannot operate unless we transmit data to companies that help us provide the Products, such as by providing us with credit reports or processing credit card charges. Your general opt-out instructions also will not apply to specific disclosures or communications to which you consent.
Personal Information Access and Correction.
FICO will provide you access to Personal Information about you in accordance with applicable law, so you can correct or delete the Personal Information. You may have additional rights in non-U.S. countries, such as objecting to and blocking the processing of your Personal Information. For security reasons, FICO will take steps to verify your identity before providing you with access to Personal Information.
Personal Data Security and Confidentiality
We have up-to-date physical safeguards, such as secure areas in buildings; electronic safeguards, such as passwords, internal and external firewalls, and encryption; and procedural safeguards, such as customer authentication procedures to prevent ID theft. Information you provide to us when you register for and order our products is transmitted to us through a secure sockets layer (SSL) transmission. We restrict access to information about you to only those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We carefully select and monitor outside service providers, such as mail vendors, who have access to customer information, and we require them to keep it safe and secure. We do not allow them to use or share the information for any purpose other than the job they are hired to do. We train our employees on these security procedures, and we conduct regular audits to check on compliance with the procedures.  Of course, you must do your part to ensure the security of your information. For example, you must guard your logon ID and password and not permit unauthorized use of your account. No security measures can provide absolute protection of data, but we will strive to provide a superior level of protection for your information.
Info Vault. Information you enter in the InfoVault feature of the Suze Orman FICO® Kit is  treated differently from other information we may collect from you.  The InfoVault is intended for you  to store private information, including personally identifiable data regarding your accounts, contact  information, social security number, medical records, and other sensitive information that you decide  to store there. That information will be available to you on our site as long as your Suze Orman FICO® Kit is active.  It is your personal information and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Privacy Policy, FICO will not use this information in any way or intentionally disclose it to any  third party without your consent or as required by law.  However, we recommend that you be extremely  careful about the information you decide to store in the InfoVault.
The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US. Privacy Shield Framework
FICO (including myFICO and FICO’s wholly owned subsidiary, Infoglide Software Corporation) participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. FICO has committed to subject to the Principles of the Privacy Shield all personal data received from the EU in reliance on the Privacy Shield, including (1) notice; (2) choice; (3) accountability for onward transfer to third parties, for which FICO may be liable if we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage; (4) security; (5) data integrity and purpose limitation; (6) access; and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability.
1. Notice. We will notify you about the purposes for which we collect and use information about you. We will provide information about how you can contact us with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which we disclose the information and the choices and means you have for limiting its use and disclosure.
2. Choice. We will not disclose your Personal Information to a third party for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected, or subsequently authorized by you, without your consent. For sensitive information, we will get your explicit (opt in) consent if the information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us as described in this Policy.
3.  Onward Transfer. If we transfer Personal Information to a third party that is acting as an agent, we will (i) transfer such data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) ascertain that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the Personal Information transferred in a manner consistent with the organization’s obligations under the Principles; (iv) require the agent to notify the organization if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (v) upon notice, including under (iv), take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (vi) provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract with that agent to the Department of Commerce upon request.
4.  Security.  We will take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.
5.  Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. We will collect and retain Personal Information that is relevant to the purposes of processing, and not in a way incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.
6. Access. You will have access to Personal Information about yourself that we hold, and you may correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the privacy risks in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. For security reasons, FICO will take steps to authenticate your identity before providing you with access to Personal Information.
7. Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  FICO will maintain a mechanism to provide that your complaints or disputes are investigated and resolved, and damages awarded where applicable law so provides. FICO will remedy problems arising out of its failure to comply with the Principles.  If you believe FICO has violated its obligations to you under the Principles, you should first raise the claimed violation directly with us, and we will respond within 45 days of receiving a complaint. If we are unable to resolve your complaint, you should next raise the issue through your Data Protection Authority to the U.S. Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue, at no cost to you. Then, if such violation still remains fully or partially unremedied, you may contact JAMS, which is an international dispute resolution provider, at no cost to you. JAMS may be reached by Internet at @jamsadr.com, phone 800.352.5267, or mail to JAMS, 18881 Von Karman Ave. Suite 350, Irvine, CA 92612. If you are contacting JAMS to lodge a complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For information about JAMS or the operation of JAMS’ dispute resolution process, contact Kathleen Pierz, JAMS Global Practice Development Manager, kpierz@jamsadr.com, 212.607.2771. The JAMS dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. For complaints and disputes over human resources data, FICO has agreed to cooperate with Data Protection Authorities. You may, under certain conditions, invoke binding arbitration.
FICO is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission and other U.S. authorized statutory bodies. FICO will disclose Personal Information to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
