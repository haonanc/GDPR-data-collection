Privacy Policy
Privacy is very important to us. Our privacy practices are held to high          standards by outside organizations such as TRUSTe. As part of the normal          operation of our services we collect and, in some cases, disclose information          about you. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you          and what may happen to that information. We have prepared a detailed policy          because we believe you should know as much as possible about Parts Geek, LLC.          The privacy practices of this statement apply only to the partsgeek.com website.         Please review the privacy policy of other websites that may be linked to this website as they         may have their own privacy policy that differ from our own.

Automatic Information
We collect information through cookies and other automated means. Cookies are commonly used by websites to save data on your computer.          The information we collect from cookies may include your IP address, browser and device characteristics, referring URLs, and a record          of your interactions with our website. We use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience on our website.
We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our          users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL          that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what          browser you are using, and your IP address.
"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that          are only available through the use of a "cookie". We use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.          Cookies can help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are          automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.

Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third parties.          For example, if you view a web page created by a vendor, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the          use of cookies by third parties.
In combination with other information we collect, a cookie may facilitate the tailoring of advertisements and offers to you, sometimes          in connection with interest-based advertising.
To help us understand and enhance our interactions with visitors to our website, we may permit web analytics providers to collect information          on our website using automated tools like cookies or web beacons.
