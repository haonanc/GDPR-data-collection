PRIVACY POLICY
Welcome to the GOOD AMERICAN website located at www.goodamerican.com and other related domains (“Website”). The Website is operated by Good American, LLC (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We believe that the privacy and security of your information and data is very important. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains the type of information (“Information”) we collect from users of the Website, how that Information is used, how the Information may be shared with other parties, and what controls our users have regarding their Information.
We encourage you to read this Policy carefully. Any updates or modifications to this Policy will be posted to our website on this page. By using or accessing the Website, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is effective as of October 18th, 2016 and was modified on May 24th, 2018.
If you reside outside of the United States and use the Borderfree platform to make purchases, please consult the sections of this policy relating to the “Processing of Orders by Borderfree and the Rights of EEA Residents” and “International Data Transfers” for certain additional provisions that may apply to you.
Information We Collect
If you reside in the United States or do not purchase goods through the Borderfree platform, there are two types of Information that may be collected through our Website: (1) “Personal Information” such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, phone number, credit card number, information about your computer and other information that may be used to directly identify you, and (2) “Usage Data” which is anonymous data about your use of the Website that is not linked to you personally.
You may enter the Website and browse its contents without submitting any Personal Information. However, if you wish to establish an account, make a purchase, contact us, subscribe to our newsletter or other mailings, post any comments, or otherwise communicate with us, we may at that time require that you provide Personal Information. When you submit Personal Information on the Website, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
If you choose to connect to our Website through a third-party social network such as Facebook (each, a “Social Network”), we may collect Personal Information from your profile on such Social Network, such as your name, username, and e-mail address, and we may publish your activity on our Website through such Social Network. In addition, our Website may offer social sharing features which will allow you to “Share” or “Like” on a Social Network. If you decide to use such features, it may allow the sharing and collection of Information both to and from such Social Network so you should check the privacy policy of each Social Network before using such features.
We may, from time to time, give you the ability to share our Website (or features or products thereon) with your friends. In order to do so, we may ask for certain Personal Information about your friends such as their name and e-mail address. It is solely your responsibility to ensure that your friend consents to receiving what you share from us. We will only use and store your friend’s Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfill your request. It will be deleted promptly after your request has been fulfilled.
Whether or not you submit Personal Information, we may collect, store or accumulate certain Usage Data based on your use of our Website, such as information regarding which of our pages or products are most popular, the browser you use, your computer’s IP address, and the URLs you visited before and after using our Website.
Please note that we will only collect your credit card information if you choose to purchase our products online via our Website and do not use the Borderfree platform. If you do make such an online purchase, our payment processing partner will collect your payment information and process your payment. We do not store any credit card information or share it with anyone other than our payment processor.
Uses and Sharing of Information
We use your Personal Information that we collect directly to process your requests, fulfill your orders, authenticate website visits/usage, inform users of relevant products and specials through promotional e-mails, maintain and develop our Website, and communicate with you. You always will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from further emails in any promotional messages we send you.
Except as described above, we will not disclose, rent, sell or share any Personal Information to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes.
We do contract with companies or individuals to provide certain services including email and hosting services, software development, credit card processing, shipping, data management, surveys and marketing, promotional services, etc. We call them our “Service Providers.” Such Service Providers include Borderfree, which processes certain orders for residents outside the United States. We may share both your Personal Information and Usage Data with Service Providers solely as appropriate for them to perform their functions. We do not share your credit card or other account information with third parties unless you authorize us to do so, or if it is necessary to fulfill our responsibilities including, but not limited to, delivering a product or service that you order.
Usage Data may be used in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such aggregate, non-personally identifiable Usage Data with or to our affiliates, licensees and partners for administrative, analytical, research, optimization, security and other purposes, but no such information will be linked with your Personal Information or be used to identify or contact you.
Finally, we may share your Information: (i) In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us; (ii) When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements; or (iii) In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
Processing of Orders by Borderfree and the Rights of EEA Residents
If you are resident in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), including countries in the European Union (“EU”) or resident in certain locations outside the United States, you may be able to purchase goods offered on our website through a facility provided by third party Borderfree Inc. (“Borderfree”). Borderfree’s operations, including collection of personal information about users who purchase goods through its facility, are governed by its own privacy policy located at https://www.borderfree.com/privacy/en_us/. If you have questions relating to Borderfree’s collection of your Personal Information, please contact Borderfree at customercare@borderfree.com.
In conjunction with your use of the Borderfree facility, you have the option to consent to provide Borderfree with certain personal data relating to you, including Personal Information, to allow Borderfree to process your orders or good through our website. Such information may be considered “Personal Data” in the EEA under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which is effective on May 25, 2018. Borderfree shares certain of this Personal Data with us so that we may fulfill or process your orders, facilitate returns, and respond to customer inquiries. If you do not provide such Personal Data, Borderfree may not be able to process your orders and we may not be able to fulfill your orders, facilitate returns or respond to customer inquiries. During the check-out process facilitated by Borderfree you also have the option to consent to provide Personal Data to us for marketing purposes. Your decision to provide such Personal Data through the Borderfree check out process or directly on our website is entirely optional.
We may also collect Personal Data about residents outside the United States, including residents in the EEA, when you choose to fill out forms on our website to obtain information about us or our goods. We may combine the Personal Data that you provide through Borderfree with Personal Data provided by you directly through our website. We use that Personal Data to provide marketing information about our goods.
We will not share the Personal Data that we obtain through Borderfree or directly from you with third parties except as described above in regard to Personal Information. You may withdraw your consent for us to process or retain your Personal Data by contacting us dataprivacy@goodamerican.com with the subject line “Personal Data Request.” If we remove your Personal Data, we may no longer be able to provide you with certain services, including processing your orders or responding to your complaints or inquiries. You always have the right to instruct us to not process your Personal Data for marketing purposes.
If you are a resident of the EEA and wish to access or correct the Personal Data that we have about you or have any questions relating to the processing of your Personal Data, please contact us at dataprivacy@goodamerican.com with the subject line “GDPR Data.”
International Data Transfers
Personal Data that is transferred to us by Borderfree with your consent or Personal Data that you submit directly to us through our website may be stored or processed in the United States, which does not have data protection laws equivalent to those in the EEA and other jurisdictions. If you do not wish your Personal Information to be stored or processed in the United States, please do not provide such information to Borderfree or to us. We protect all Personal Data transferred to the United States in the same manner as we protect Personal Information.
Privacy and Security
It is entirely your choice whether or not you provide Personal Information to us. We take commercially reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational precautions to protect our customers' Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us or from us, and you do so at your own risk. You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the Internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.
In addition, while we take commercially reasonable steps to govern our Service Providers’ use and protection of your Personal Information, we ultimately have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such parties. As a condition to your use of the Website, you expressly agree we bear no responsibility, and are not liable in any way, for the acts, omissions or policies of our Service Providers or any other external sources with respect to your Information.
If you believe your Personal Information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please immediately notify us via email at dataprivacy@goodamerican.com.
