Change of Control
If CCP experiences a “Change of Control” (defined below), then we may amend our information practices as described in this Privacy Policy.

insolvency;
appointment of a receiver for our business or assets;
we become subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, whether domestic or foreign; or
