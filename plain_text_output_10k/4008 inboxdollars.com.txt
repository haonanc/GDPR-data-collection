III. CO-REGISTRATION
Definition
InboxDollars® signup pages may contain co-registration checkboxes, where Users can choose       to “co-register” for other websites, tools, or services during their registration       with InboxDollars® by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration Offer. Users are       not required to select any co-registration boxes to join InboxDollars®; however, they may       be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or other promotions.
Information Sharing
When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking       the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to InboxDollars® may be shared       with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. InboxDollars® cannot       control what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.
Privacy on Other Sites and Within Third Party Frames
The Service Platform may contain links to third party websites, services, or tools. Similarly,       the Service Platform may contain framed / webview content from a third party. We provide these       links for your convenience. We do not review, control or monitor the privacy practices of       websites, services or tools operated by others. We are not responsible for the performance of       these sites, services or tools or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other       websites, services, or third party tools is subject to the terms and conditions of those third       party items, including the privacy policies of those websites, services, and/or/ third party       tools (including, but not limited to Outbrain, Inc ).
in short:
IV. COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY
About Cookies and Third Party Technology.
A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer       when you visit a website or similar technology or open an email. Cookies permit a website or       similar technology operator to “remember” whether your computer has visited the       website, tool or service before and helps the operator create a more personalized experience for       you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed. (In all cases in this Privacy       Policy, the word “computer” includes all forms and styles of computing technologies       including but not limited to desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet devices, smart-phones,       other mobile or wearable computing technology.)
In addition to cookie technology, InboxDollars® and our Advertisers use additional third       party technology and tracking tools to record offers and activities completed by you, friends       referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as demographic information       (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as       requested by Advertisers. These items are referred to as “Cookies and Recording       Tools” as further described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
Your computer, tablet, smart-phone or similar device should permit you to change the settings on       your web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools.  However, if you do       not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by InboxDollars® and our Advertisers, you may       not be able to use certain functions on certain websites, services or tools. More importantly,       if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other       actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your       activity. If you do not want to accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using the       Service Platform.
Third Party Cookies
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, we or a data provider we have engaged may place or       recognize a unique Cookie and/or Recording Tool on your browser or elsewhere on your computing       device to enable you to receive customized ads or content. These Cookies and Recording Tools       contain no personally identifiable information. The Cookies and Recording Tools may reflect       de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us,       e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human       readable form. To opt-out of these Cookies and Recording Tools, please go to www.aboutads.info/choices .
Referral and Affiliate Tracking
InboxDollars® uses Cookies and Recording Tools in order to track new User registrations.       This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users, as well as to track earnings       for our Affiliates.
User Recognition
After a User has logged into the InboxDollars® Member’s Section, Cookies and       Recording Tools are used to remember their Username and Password so they do not need to be       entered during every visit to the Service Platform. Users can logout of the Member’s       Section if they do not wish to have this information saved.
Location (Geo) Tracking
From time to time, InboxDollars® may permit Members to participate in activities, or       provide offers, that involve use of location tracking / geo-tracking technology, that will share       the physical location of a Member’s computer or mobile device. For example, we may       contract with a market research firm that would track a Member’s physical location through       geo-tracking / mobile technology for market research purposes. A Member may choose to opt-out or       opt-in to this experience and offer. If the individual opts-in, the Member agrees to permit       location-tracking, and also may be required to agree to the terms of service of such third       party. If a Member opts-in to location (geo) tracking, InboxDollars® may then share such       information with any/all the third parties with whom it does business that request such       information.
in short:
Our cookies, geo Location, and other tracking mechanisms are used in part to ensure you                             receive credit from our partners & affiliates.
