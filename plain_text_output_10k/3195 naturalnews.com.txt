(NewsTarget) In the wake of a number lawsuits leveled at phone companies over their alleged involvement with a U.S. government domestic spying program, AT&T has revised its privacy policy to make it clear to customers exactly who owns their phone records.
The company's original policy stated that it could share private customer information to "respond to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, to the extent required and/or permitted by law," and "to establish or exercise" its legal rights.
Under the new policy, AT&T makes clear to their customers that AT&T owns their data, claiming that customer data are considered "business records that are owned by AT&T. As such, AT&T may disclose such records to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process."
Another change made by the phone giant, formed when AT&T merged with SBC Communications in November, is that customers now have to agree to the policy in order to use AT&T services.
