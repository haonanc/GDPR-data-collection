9. Other important privacy information
Notice to End-Users
Our Services are intended for use by enterprises. Where our Services are made available to you through a Subscriber of ours, that enterprise is the data controller of your personal information. Your data privacy questions and request should initially be submitted to the Zendesk Subscriber in its capacity as your data controller. Zendesk is not responsible for our Subscribers’ privacy or security practices which may be different than this Policy.
Zendesk’s Subscribers are able to:
restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
access and describe your personal information that you provided to them;
access and export your personal information processed by them; and
amend your personal information, including your end-user profile.
Data retention
Where Zendesk is the data controller of personal information (for example, personal information relating to Website Visitors, Attendees and individuals who register to use our Services), then we retain the personal information we collect where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with our Services, to enable your participation in an event, and to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
If your personal information is processed within a Subscriber’s Service Data, we will process the personal information for as long as we are instructed to do so by the relevant Subscriber that is the data controller of the Subscriber Service Data.

You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.
Correcting, updating and removing your information:
An individual who seeks to exercise their data protection rights in respect of personal information stored or processed by us on behalf of a Subscriber of ours within the Subscriber’s Service Data (including to seek access to, or to correct, amend, delete, port or restrict processing of such personal information) should direct his/her query to our Subscriber (the data controller).

Request that we stop using your information:
You may request that your personal information no longer be accessed, stored, used and otherwise processed where you believe that a Zendesk Subscriber or we do not have the appropriate rights to do so.
