We take the privacy of our users very seriously. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Policy because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us via email at privacy@livingly.com  or in writing at: Privacy Director, Livingly Media, Inc., 101 Redwood Shores Parkway, Suite 150, Redwood City, CA 94065.
Online Privacy Standards. While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission’s Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at https://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy-online-fair-information-practices-electronic-marketplace-federal-trade-commission .
What This Policy Covers. This policy covers Livingly Media’s treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website or use our services. We regard personally identifiable information as information that someone can use to identify or contact you in person, such as real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address. Information that we use internally to identify you as a member in our system, such as your selected UserID, is not considered personally identifiable information.
What This Policy Does Not Cover. This policy does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as our partners and advertisers. In addition, we may provide links to other services and on occasion to other sites that may interest you. All of these sites operate independently of Livingly and they have their own privacy or security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.
HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE
Registration Information. During the registration process, we collect your email address. We will send you an email to verify that you are the owner of this address. You will also choose a UserID that we will use to identify you in our system.In general, we make it easy for you to view the personally identifiable information we have collected from you in your member profile page, where you can add, edit, or delete it as you see fit.
INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT
Children. As explained further in our Terms of Service, currently available at http://www.livinglymedia.com/terms-of-service/ , you must be 13 years of age or older to register to use our website.

This information includes internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), site entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve our site, analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site, and gather aggregate information about our user base as a whole. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or members from which individual member identities have been removed, and therefore does not include your personally identifiable information.

It can also help us understand how our site visitors click to our site, and what pages they view during their visit. Similar to many websites, we store an encrypted cookie on your computer so we can remember you when you come back to our website without requiring you to log-in every time. Cookies also allow us to track and understand the interests of our users to enhance the overall experience on our site.
Our partners. Some of our business partners may also use cookies on our site. For example, some of our advertising partners may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. We have no access to or control over these cookies, and, as noted above, this privacy policy does not govern the use of cookies by our business partners or advertisers.
