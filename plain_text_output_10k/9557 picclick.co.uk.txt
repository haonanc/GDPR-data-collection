Any access or use of the Services by you after such notice shall be deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such changes, modifications or additions.

2. PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect information that may allow the identification of a natural person (“Personal Information”) (i) from Customers, (ii) from individuals who upload user-generated content to Customer or other digital properties (such as a Customer’s website, Instagram or Facebook) on behalf of our Customers (“Social Media Users”), and (iii) from users which interact with the Customer galleries.
With regard to each of these groups we collect the following Personal Information:
Customers: We collect the name, email address, telephone number, Internet Protocol (IP) address and (if available) the social media user name of those employees that Olapic interacts with or has interacted with.
Social Media Users: We collect information from Social Media Users such as public uploads and posts, including publicly posted photographs. With such assets, we process name, social media username, physical address (if available), email address (if available), IP address, and geo location (if available).
End Users: When End Users interact with our websites or user galleries we collect IP address and date/timestamp. If an End User buys products directly from a Customer digital property, Olapic additionally collects purchase information (including purchased product ID, transaction ID, transaction price, date of purchase, unique ID that our Customer may have assigned to such End User), email address and username (if provided by End Users to Customers). If an End User provides their name, business title, and email address to subscribe to an Olapic newsletter or to participate in a competition by Olapic, we will collect and store such information as provided by the End Users to us.
3. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Current Customers: We use the Personal Information we have collected from you to provide you with information about and access to our Services, to communicate with you about updates, maintenance, outages or other technical matters concerning our Services, to respond to your questions or inquiries regarding our Services and to allow you to download information such as whitepapers, all to fulfil our contractual obligations.
Social Media Users: We only process Personal Information we collect from you to provide the services for which our Customers have engaged us. Our Customers to whom you have submitted content through the Olapic Services or whose brand hashtags, @brand mentions or branded location tags you have included in your social media posts, may use your username or email address to communicate with you, in addition to using your photo. IP and geo-location are used to filter content by region, country or other local area. Such data is used with your consent only.
End Users: We process the Personal Information described above to allow our Customers to analyze with which digital assets you interacted prior to purchasing a product from a Customer digital property after interacting with the user galleries on those digital properties. Furthermore, we collect the information to improve our Services, and to improve marketing, analytics and the functionality of our Services. Finally, we log IP and date/timestamp to investigate and/or prevent security breaches. We collect personal data during newsletter signup and participation in competitions in order to be able to send the newsletter and inform the competition winners.
4. ACCESS TO AND DELETION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
Upon request, Olapic will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Information and, if that is the case, what Personal Information we hold. If your Personal Information changes, or if you wish to exercise your right to be forgotten, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate your information from our records by (for Customers) logging into your account and making the appropriate changes or emailing your Account Manager directly, or (for Social Media and End Users) contacting Olapic at privacy@olapic.com . We will respond to requests to access Personal Information under this paragraph within 14 business days of receipt of such request.

Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the social media company providing them.

To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@olapic.com . In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. Alternatively, if you used a third party application to post such information, you can remove it, by either logging into such application and removing the information or by contacting the appropriate third party application.
13. MOBILE APPLICATION
When you download our mobile application and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and system and performance information.
We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application and the Services.
We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
14. SECURING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Nonetheless, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we make no guarantee as to the security of your information or that your information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. When you enter sensitive information (such as Customer log in credentials entered onto the Olapic dashboard), we encrypt the transmission and storage of that information using industry standard encryption technologies. If you contact us by email or a “contact us” or similar feature on our website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. If you have any questions regarding security you can contact us at privacy@olapic.com.
We will make any legally or contractually required disclosures of any breach of confidentiality, privacy, or integrity of your personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
15. BUSINESS TRANSFER
In the event that Olapic is or substantially all of its assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, such databases containing Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.
