Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Venture collects non-personal information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Venture's purpose in collecting non-personally identifiable information is to better understand how Venture's visitors use Venture.com. From time to time, Venture may release non-personal information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Venture uses cookies to help Venture identify and track visitors, their usage of Venture.com, and their website access preferences. Venture.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Venture.com, with the drawback that certain features of Venture may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
Venture also collects potentially personally-identifiable information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Venture does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personal information, as described below.
Aggregated Statistics
Venture may collect information that does not contain personal information in order for the purpose of creating statistics about the behavior of visitors to Venture. For instance, Venture may monitor the most popular pages on the Venture site. Venture may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifiable Information
Venture discloses potentially personal and personally-identifiable information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Venture's behalf or to provide services available at Venture.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. By using Venture, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Venture may disclose personal information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Venture believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Venture, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Venture and have supplied your email address, Venture may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Venture and our services. You may change this setting in your account preferences.
Venture takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of personal information.
Business Transfers
If Venture, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Venture goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Venture may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
Governing Law
This policy, and all related matters are governed solely by the laws of British Columbia, Canada and applicable federal laws of Canada. Any dispute between you and Venture or any other person arising from, connected with or relating to this Privacy Policy, or any related matters (collectively "Disputes") will be resolved solely in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
If there is any dispute arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy, then the parties will first use reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve such dispute, first by direct negotiation and then, if that is not successful, by mediation with a neutral third party mediator acceptable to both parties. Each party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection with any mediation and all costs and expenses of the mediator will be shared equally by the parties.
Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Venture may change Venture's Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Venture's sole discretion. Venture encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
