Information Collection and Use
Information You Provide
Users can browse our websites without logging in or providing any Personal Information, although we passively collect certain other information as described below.  The IP address of your device is collected when you access the Services for the purposes of system administration, security, and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our affiliates or vendors.

When you subscribe to any of our magazines or products, register for a newsletter, download our mobile apps, purchase an item, enter contests, contact us for any information or to ask a question, or participate in other on-line activities (e.g., surveys, providing comments, participating in social media or on-line games), you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information, which may include your name, street address, city, state, zip code, email address, and phone number (landline and/or mobile).   It is always your choice whether or not to provide us with such Personal Information.  However, if you do not provide the necessary information you may not be able to access some or all of the features of the Services. We also will have no way to respond to your questions or inquiries.
To summarize, the Personal Information we collect from you is meant to help us:
• fulfil your order
• send you renewal notifications and/or service billing notifications
