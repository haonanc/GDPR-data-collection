GolfDiscount.com occasionally sends special offers and discounts via email. You can sign up from any page via the webform in the footer. We do not "spam" anyone, but if your server does have anti-spam software, it may read it as such and block it. If you are on the list but don't seem to be getting our alerts, this may be the reason. Contact your email administrator for solutions. You may unsubscribe at anytime by simply sending a blank email to info@golfdiscount.com .

Cookies
GolfDiscount.com also utilizes cookies to keep track of vital information during shopping cart transactions such as item numbers, user id, etc. Cookies do not gather information from the user's hard drive and pose no security risk. They also remember who you are and what items you have in your shopping cart. When you return to GolfDiscount.com, you don't have to waste time re-entering information. This would not be possible without those cookies. They are a useful and valuable thing for both user and server.
If you get annoying pop-up messages stating that "the server wants to place a cookie...accept or reject?", this means that your browser's preferences are set to ask each time a cookie is sent. Set this box to "always accept cookies" if you are going to use GolfDiscount.com's secure shopping cart and you will not get those messages.
