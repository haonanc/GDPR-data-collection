We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it. When we transfer personal data from the European Union (“EU Data”) to the U.S., we adhere to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles of notice; choice; onward transfer; security; data integrity and purpose limitation; access; and recourse, enforcement and liability designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission (the “Principles”).
