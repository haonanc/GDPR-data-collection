The data controller collecting and processing the personal information provided by a visitor to ey.com (“Our Site”) is the EY member firm in the visitor’s country or another EY member firm to which the visitor has submitted their personal information.
This statement, set forth below, is our privacy statement for the global organisation of EY member firms and other entities within EY. Here we describe the practices we follow to respect the privacy of all visitors to Our Site.
In this statement, personal information means data which relates to an individual and which identifies that individual, either directly or indirectly, such as your name or your contact information.
If you have any questions regarding the processing of your personal information, please contact us or your usual EY representative.
Collection, use, disclosure, choice
Registration is not required for you to use Our Site. If you are merely a visitor, we do not collect any personal information about you, except to the limited extent through the use of cookies, which are described below. However, there may be circumstances in which you choose to register and receive ongoing updates from EY. In these cases, EY may contact registrants to invite them to special events, provide them with information about our services, publications and products, or for other marketing purposes.
For example, you may choose to register for:
Email alerts
EY offers an email alert service to site visitors, in which we send subscribers email updates when new information is added to Our Site. If you decide to subscribe, we will collect basic contact information about you, such as your name and email address.
Expressing an interest in working for EY
Our Site enables you to register your interest in working for us or applying for an advertised vacancy. For more detail about the recruitment process and the information required, visit the careers section of Our Site.
Thought Center Webcasts
To view an EY Thought Center Webcast (live or archived), registration is required. When you register, you may be asked for personal information (name, contact information, etc.). The type of information collected will vary. At the time of registration, you are also asked whether or not you are a client of EY, and whether or not you would like to be informed of upcoming webcasts via Thought Center Webcast email alerts.
Your information is required in order to view any webcast. At the time of registration, you can check a box to automate the log-in process, which allows you to be automatically logged on upon your return to the EY Thought Center Webcast section when using the same computer. We use registration information for internal research and analysis purposes to help us understand who is viewing our webcasts, and become better equipped to serve your needs.
If you are interested in Thought Center Webcasts, but you do not wish to provide any personally identifiable information, you can read the executive summaries ("webcast recaps") posted on Our Site, which require no registration.
Surveys
EY may conduct surveys via Our Site. Survey participants may be asked for personal information (name, contact information, etc.) in addition to opinions or feedback. The type of information collected in surveys will vary.
Thought leadership registration
EY occasionally requires registration in exchange for our thought leadership: white papers, articles, studies, reports, survey analyses, booklets, etc. Your personal information may be requested in registration forms and the type of information collected from you will vary. EY reserves the right to distribute certain thought leadership materials only to those who supply the requested information.
Event registration
EY facilitates event registration via Our Site or, at times, via third party web sites. Personal information may be collected via event registration forms and the type of information collected will vary. EY may share registrant information with third parties in association with the event.
Examples of "third parties" include hotels, sponsors or co-sponsors, promoters, event organisers (including via third party web sites), speakers, panelists, etc. Please check the details provided at individual events to understand fully how your information will be used and retained.
Entrepreneur Of The Year®
EY accepts nominations for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year program via Our Site. Personal information, including financial data, is required of the nominee, and the nominee must sign the nomination form. Nomination forms are provided to the program sponsors and independent national and regional panels of judges in order to select award recipients.
Further, some of the information on the nomination form may be used for research, educational, or any other purpose, but we will not divulge the personal identity of the nominee or the identity of the nominee's company to any person other than the sponsors, the judges, and their respective affiliates.
Nominees must consent to this usage in order to participate in the nomination process. The nominator may include their own personal information on the form, however, this may not always be required. If nominator information is supplied, it is subject to the same terms as nominee information.

EY Alumni
Any personal information that an alumnus submits to EY will only be used to maintain contact with that alumnus, and will not be disclosed to any third party without the individual’s express permission.
EY Client Portal
If you have been given access rights to EY Client Portal by your EY contact, we would recommend you take note of the full privacy notice associated with this service. You will have access to the notice once you log onto EY Client Portal.
Information collected at registration is protected using industry-standard encryption technology as it is sent over the Internet.
If you register on Our Site, your personal information will be stored in our customer relationship management (CRM) system.

When explicitly requested by you, the site visitor; or
As required by a court order or any other legal or regulatory requirement; or
Where the disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or other disposition of all or part of our business.

Cookies and Web Beacons
Our Site uses cookies, Web Beacons and other web technologies such as CAPTCHA’s to improve Our Site’s performance and to enhance your browsing experience. Certain areas of Our Site also use cookies to understand more about you, so we can offer you a more personalised browsing experience.
What is a cookie?
A "cookie" is technology that allows Our Site to store tokens of information (an 'identifier') in your browser used only by Our Site while you are on Our Site. Cookies are not used to determine the personal identity of anyone who is merely visiting Our Site. They serve to help us track traffic patterns to determine a user’s preferred location and language so that we can direct them to the correct country home page when they visit Our Site.
Cookies have other uses as well. For example, in the Thought Center Webcast section ("Webcast Section"), they are used to provide entry for subscribers who have chosen the automatic log-on feature during registration. Cookies are also used to prevent online poll participants from voting more than once.
On certain pages of Our Site, cookies are used to help us track your interests while you browse the internet, so we can tailor more relevant advertising to you, and to understand what is important to you.
How do I disable cookies?
If you do not want to receive a cookie from Our Site or the Webcast Section, you have the option of setting your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, so that you may determine whether to accept it or not. However, please be aware that if you do turn off 'cookies' in your browser, you will not be able to fully experience some of Our Sites.

Targeting and Tracking Cookies
On certain pages of Our Site, we use cookies to help us understand your interests as you browse the internet, so we can tailor and deliver to you a more personalised service in the future.

Targeting and tracking cookies are provided via trusted third party suppliers. Should you require more information regarding our suppliers and how these cookies operate please contact us .
What are Web Beacons?
EY occasionally advertises on third party web sites. As part of our effort to track the success of our advertising campaigns, we may at times use a visitor identification technology such as "web beacons," or "action tags," which count visitors who have come to Our Site after being exposed to an EY banner ad on a third party site. We do not use this technology to access your personal information and it is only used to compile aggregated statistics about visitors who come to Our Site to gauge the effectiveness of our ads.

EY may also provide links to other social media platforms maintained on separate servers by individuals or organisations over which EY has no control. EY makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy or any other aspect of the information located on such servers.
A link to a third party’s website should not be construed as an endorsement by either EY or that third party of the other or its products and services.
