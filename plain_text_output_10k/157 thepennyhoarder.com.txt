How We Respond to “Do Not Track” Signals
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to online services you visit. California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how TMC responds to “do not track” browser settings. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, TMC currently does not take action in response to these signals.
