The NPDB Privacy Policy
The NPDB Privacy Policy
The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to the NPDB. As a federal agency, the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires us to protect certain information we collect. Specifically, if we collect information that will be placed in the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) we will provide a separate Privacy Act notice at the point of collection, identifying (1) the legal authority which authorizes the collection; (2) whether the disclosure of the information is mandatory or voluntary; (3) the principal purpose(s) for the information; (4) the routine uses of the information; and (5) the effects, if any, of not providing the requested information. The Federal Register notices, which describe the Privacy Act aspects of the NPDB, can be found at 62 Fed. Reg. 12653 (1997) and 64 Fed. Reg. 7653 (1999) , respectively. The privacy policy information below applies to the data we collect over the internet, regardless of whether it is also protected by the Privacy Act.
This is our notice about what personal information we collect; why we collect  personal information; how we use it; with whom we share it; how to get access to information; and how we protect the information we collect and maintain.

How We Protect the Security of the Information We Collect

We have extensive security controls that are tested and reviewed continually
