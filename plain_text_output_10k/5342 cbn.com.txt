Who Do We Share Your Personal Information With?
CBN reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party, if CBN has reason to believe that disclosing personal information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) its rights or property, other website users or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities. Additionally, CBN may disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, warrant or other court order, or when we believe in good faith that a law, regulation, subpoena, warrant or other court order requires it, or authorizes us to do so, or to respond to an emergency situation.
We may share information with other CBN and affiliated entities, such as between the CBN and CBN Europe. See more information with respect to such transfers under the section titled “Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders.”  We may also share your information with others, such as accountants and lawyers, who assist us in carrying out our activities.
CBN may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist CBN in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide such assistance and are legally required to protect personal information disclosed by CBN and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy.

Transfer of Personal Information Across Borders
CBN is a Christian organization with a global outreach, headquartered and operating in Virginia Beach, Virginia (USA). We may allow your personal information to be shared with our related entities or third-party service providers based both within the United States and in other countries. This may entail a transfer of your information from a location within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to outside the EEA, or from outside the EEA to a location within the EEA.
When we provide your personal information to a third party service in other global regions, we do so in connection with providing you with member benefits, requested information or services or as required or authorized under law. It is possible the global entities, with which we share your information with, may not be subject to foreign laws that provide the same level of protection of information as your country of residence or employment, or may not be subject to any privacy obligations. Global entities may be required or compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, such as an overseas authority.
CBN works to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use reasonable and appropriate procedures and security features to prevent unauthorized access.
CBN also sends push notifications, the delivery of information from a software application to your mobile device through services such as Apple's Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google's CD2M and Cloud Messaging for Android devices. Both services are standard features of these mobile device operating systems. CBN manages access, use and disclosure of your personal data that results from your use of these services.
