Please read the following to learn more about what information we collect, what we do with that information, and how we may use your personal information.
Information Collected.
How Information is Collected. To enhance your user experience and improve the InspireMore Services, InspireMore collects information about you from two sources: (i) information you affirmatively give to us; and (ii) information automatically collected when you use any InspireMore Services (“InspireMore”). Third parties may also collect your information in connection with your use of InspireMore Services unless a user refuses to consent to the disclosure of information to third parties.
Information You Affirmatively Give Us. In using InspireMore Services, you may provide us with personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use of and activities at our website that may be connected with you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information that we collect may include, but is not limited to, your name, username, email address, and password. Personal Information may also include information you supply to us concerning your preferences, geographic location, and interests expressed in the course of use InspireMore Services.
Information Automatically Collected. We also collect information about your visit from the browser on your computer (via Cookies and other tracking technologies as defined below) or mobile device including but not limited to the time and date you visit the InspireMore Services, your geographic location, IP address, device information, cookies and the pages you request — to analyze trends, administer the site, track your navigation of the site, deliver relevant advertisements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use (note that IP addresses are not linked to “personally identifiable information”). Additionally, we collect aggregate information from multiple users without personally identifying individuals, such as geographic region, which we may share with our business partners (who include third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, and distribution partners) — to improve understanding of customer needs and provide relevant services.
By using InspireMore Services, you are giving InspireMore permission to use and store such information consistent with this privacy policy.
Creating an InspireMore Account and Profile Information. There are two (2) types of InspireMore accounts that can be created, one account can be created for select authors chosen by InspireMore and the other account can be created by users from the general public. When you create a InspireMore account, you provide access credentials in the form of a username, email address, and password or by authentication using another service, such as Facebook. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location, and profile picture. If you create your InspireMore account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from the connected account to help complete your InspireMore profile. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on InspireMore Services, such as on your profile page.
Content, Following, and Other Public Information. InspireMore is a website geared toward inspiring others on a daily basis, so some information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the content that you post and data provided with such content, such as when it was posted, but also the content you follow, the content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on InspireMore Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access InspireMore. When you share information or content via InspireMore Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.

With Whom Information Is Shared
Public Information – InspireMore may share as it sees fit information that you voluntarily make public. Since such public information can be accessed by the public and used by any member of the public, such use by third parties is beyond the control of InspireMore.
When you post content on the InspireMore Services, we also collect, process, and store the contents of the InspireMore Services on our servers. The contents of the InspireMore Services can also be temporarily stored on the devices of users. We cannot prevent others from making copies of your content (e.g. taking a screenshot). You should not use InspireMore to send messages if you want to be certain that the general public cannot keep a copy.
Personal Information – If we have your express consent, InspireMore may share your personal information it collects with business partners and other third parties that are not affiliated with InspireMore. InspireMore will never share your personal information without your consent, unless compelled to do so by law.
Under narrow circumstances, InspireMore may disclose your personal information without asking for your consent to protect the legal rights of InspireMore or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents, and suppliers; to protect the safety and security of users of the InspireMore Services or to enforce our Terms of Services; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required. If you notify us you believe your legal rights have been violated by InspireMore or another user of InspireMore Services, we may provide the information you provide to us to others if we believe it is necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint. For instance, if you submit a notice of copyright infringement to us, we may send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored, or transmitted the material addressed by the communication.
Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Data
InspireMore may share with third parties your non-personal information and related aggregated data. For example, InspireMore may share IP addresses or general demographic information of its users to provide anonymous aggregated data to business partners (i.e. third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, and distribution partners) about the volume of use on InspireMore Services and the specific InspireMore Services in which users are most interested. Because this form of data does not identify particular users, these third parties will not be able to contact you based solely on this data.
Change of Control
If InspireMore sells all or part of its business, makes a sale or transfer of assets, is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, InspireMore may transfer your personal information and non-personal information to one or more third parties as part of such transaction.
How You Can Control the Information We Collect, Use and Share
You have the choice about whether to disclose your personal information or other information about yourself to InspireMore. Regardless of your choices regarding promotional communications and updates regarding content, InspireMore may send you administrative messages, service announcements, terms and conditions of your account, or other similar communications, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.
