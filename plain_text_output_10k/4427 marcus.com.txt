Like most website operators, Animistic Studios collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.

From time to time, Animistic Studios may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Animistic Studios also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on I-marcus.com blogs/sites.
