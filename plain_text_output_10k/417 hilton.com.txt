We may share this information with third parties, including business partners and service providers, to provide information, offers, and services that may be of interest to you. You may prevent or limit collection of location information by changing the settings in the Hilton Honors app, or by changing your device’s settings.
For certain properties, we also make available real-time or virtual “concierge” features, which may be pre-loaded onto a Hilton-owned device, downloadable to your web-enabled mobile device, or available as part of the Hilton Honors App. For example, you can communicate directly with the hotel; order services from the hotel, such as room service or valet parking; access our websites; access third-party websites, including local attractions and social media; and book a reservation.

If we do so, the privacy policies of those services apply.
We offer all of these mobile and location-based services only to the extent permitted by applicable local laws.
Links to Third-Party Websites and Services
Our site and our mobile applications may contain links to third parties' websites. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of data and information by such third parties.

You can access those terms and policies using the links on the service sign-in page, or by visiting the Internet provider’s website.
Hilton will take reasonable measures to: (i) protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, and (ii) keep personal information accurate and up-to-date as appropriate. Hilton employs a robust internal team of dedicated information security professionals who are responsible for creating, updating and managing Hilton’s security program. Hilton’s Global Information Security team is responsible for, among many other things, monitoring our systems for potential intrusions, responding to potential incidents, supporting property-level information security, regularly reviewing and updating the security controls Hilton uses to protect data, and providing training on Hilton’s information security program. Hilton maintains a PCI compliance program and an IT compliance program.

In the event of a security incident, Hilton will notify regulators and/or consumers as required by applicable laws or regulations.
