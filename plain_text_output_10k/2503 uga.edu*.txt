Authorized uses of                         sensitive information within the University are limited to uses which a) are necessary                         to meet legal and regulatory requirements; b) facilitate access to services, transactions,                         facilities and information; or c) support efficient academic and administrative processes.

5.1 Lawful Basis for Collecting and Processing of Personal Data 
The University is an institute of higher education involved in education, research,                            and community development.  In order for the University to educate its students both in class and on-line, engage                            in world-class research, and provide community services, it is essential, necessary,                            and the University has lawful bases to collect, process, use, and maintain data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its                            educational, research, and community programs. The lawful bases include, without limitation,                            admission, registration, delivery of classroom, on-line, and study abroad education,                            grades, communications, employment, research, development, program analysis for improvements,                            and records retention. Examples of data that the University may need to collect in                            connection with the lawful bases are: name, email address, IP address, physical address                            or other location identifier, photos, as well as some sensitive personal data obtained                            with prior consent.
For more information regarding the EU GDPR, please review the University’s European                            Union General Data Protection Regulation Compliance Policy.
Most of the University’s collection and processing of personal data will fall under                         the following categories:
a) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by                         the University or third parties in providing education, employment, research and development,                         community programs.
b) Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject                         is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering                         into a contract. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to research                         contracts.
c) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the University                         is subject. This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to compliance                         with state and federal laws. Examples are providing enrollment data to the US Department                         of Education and providing employment and payroll data as required by the US Internal                         Revenue Service.
d) The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data                         for one or more specific purposes.This lawful basis pertains primarily but not exclusively to the protection of research                         subjects, providing medical and mental health services.
There will be some instances where the collection and processing of personal data                         will be pursuant to other lawful bases.
5.2 Types of Personal Data collected and why
The University collects a variety of personal and sensitive data to meet one of its                            lawful bases, as referenced above. Most often the data is used for academic admissions,                            enrollment, educational programs, job hiring, provision of medical services, participation                            in research, development and community outreach. Data typically includes name, address,                            transcripts, work history, information for payroll, research subject information,                            medical and health information (for student health services, or travel), and donations.                            If you have specific questions regarding the collection and use of your personal data,                            please contact the Office of Information Security at infosec@uga.edu.
If a data subject refuses to provide personal data that is required by the University                            in connection with one of the University’s lawful bases to collect such personal data,                            such refusal may make it impossible for the University to provide education, employment,                            research or other requested services.
Where the University gets Personal and Sensitive Personal Data
The University receives personal and sensitive data from multiple sources. Most often,                            the University gets this data directly from the data subject or under the direction                            of the data subject who has provided it to a third party (for example, application                            for admission to the University through use of the Common App).
