This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that is processed by Red Roof in the course of our business.

With respect to Consumer Information (as defined below) this Policy applies to Red Roof franchisees and others that manage, operate, franchise, license, own and/or provide services under the Red Roof Brand.
All individuals whose responsibilities include the processing of Personal Information on behalf of Red Roof are expected to protect that Personal Information by adhering to this Privacy Policy.
1. The Types of Personal Information We Collect And What We Do With It
As a hotel operator, it is necessary for Red Roof to collect and store Personal Information in connection with the delivery of lodging and related services. Although we endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant, we also must comply with many laws that require hotel operators to collect and retain Personal Information.
Red Roof collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective and former guests, hotel property visitors, website visitors and other consumers (“Consumers”) travel and other business partners such as franchisees (“Business Partners”), and individuals who work for us including current, prospective and former employees, contractors and temporary and other seasonal workers (“Team Members”) based on the legal grounds and legitimate business purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. The types of Personal Information we collect and our privacy practices depends on the nature of the relationship you have with Red Roof and the requirements of applicable law. Below are some of the ways we collect Personal Information and how we use it:
a. Information You Provide Directly: When Consumers, Business Partners and Team Members contact us directly through our call center or website, enroll in one of our programs such as our franchise partner or RediCard Loyalty program, or submit an application or other form, they may be asked to provide Personal Information such as name, email address and payment information like a credit or debit card number. We will use this information to respond to requests, manage our relationship with you, and /or communicate about our programs and our promotions.
b. Hotel Stay Information: During a hotel stay, our hotels will have access to reservation information and may collect additional information to authenticate the reservation such as a driver’s license or passport ID, or other information to manage and enhance the guest experience including vehicle information, onsite purchases, internet, media and wireless service usage and other information to support safety and security or as required by law. We may collect other related information such as demographic information, travel agent information and information about preferences and interests (such as if you prefer a non-smoking room) and hotel-based activities (such as vehicle information, or use of hotel services). If we combine other information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
c. Technology and Device Information: We may automatically collect information from when you use technology including IP address, mobile device ID, and similar device identifiers, and information about how you use these services. We use this information for a variety of purposes, including to provide wireless services to guests and enhancing or otherwise improving our website.
d. Applicant and Team Member Information: If you apply to be a Red Roof affiliate or Franchise Partner or apply for a job, Red Roof or its Third-Party-service provider may ask you to provide self-identifying information (such as gender, and ethnicity and other background information). Red Roof or its Third-Party-service provider may use this information to determine your partnership or employment eligibility and share this information with government or regulatory agencies to fulfill reporting requirements or defend against related litigation and complaints.
e. Supplemental Information from Third-Parties: We may collect information about Consumers, Business Partners and Team Members from Third-Party sources to provide the services you request or to supplement information we received.
For example, we may receive information about you from Third-Parties, including without limitation employment service providers, airlines, travel agents and companies (for example, booking.com and expedia.com) and event planners. In addition, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records such as from your travel agent in order to provide you with information, services, or products you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may interest you, and for other purposes, including marketing demographics. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.
f. Promotional Analytics and Similar Advertising Information: Red Roof works with network advertisers, ad agencies, social media services, analytics service providers, and other vendors to advertise our services and provide us with information regarding the effectiveness of our advertisements. These service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies and local storage) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you which we may use to: target advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share usage information about visitors with third-party advertising and social media companies, analytics providers, and other vendors for similar purposes.

Interest-based advertising is advertising that tries to make the ads you see more interesting and relevant to you based on the types of sites you visit online and other information that does not personally identify you. Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners’ use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. You can opt out of the collection and use of your information for interest-based advertising by going to http://optout.aboutads.info or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ to limit collection through the Red Roof Site or by configuring the settings on your mobile device to limit ad tracking through the mobile applications. Even if you opt-out, we may still collect and use non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Websites and/or information from the advertisements on third-party websites for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.
4. Cookies
Our Website, Redroof.com, utilizes “cookie” technology. “Cookies” are encrypted strings of text that a Website stores on a user’s computer. The Website uses cookies throughout the online reservation process to keep together information entered on multiple pages. For example, cookies enable our Website to “remember” dates entered at the start of a search for room availability at multiple locations. In addition, cookies are used to:
1. Measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; and
2. Provide functionality such as online reservations and mapping functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you.
The two (2) types of cookies that we use are referred to as “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are temporary and are automatically deleted when you leave our Website. Persistent cookies remain on your computer hard drive until you delete them. We do not use cookies to gather any personally identifiable information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. You may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing so will adversely affect your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our Website.
5. Rights of Access, Rectification, Erasure and Restriction
Individuals from the EU may inquire as to whether Red is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete your Personal Information where it is inaccurate. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may click on the following link https://www.redroof.com/privacy-form or use any of the methods set out in this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), seek rectification, or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by Red Roof. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws.
Although Red Roof makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which Red Roof is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual’s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If Red Roof determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, Red Roof will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.
6. Protection of Personal Information by Red Roof Inns

We exercise care in providing secure transmission and storage of information.
Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot warrant that all data we transmit, store and collect will be completely secure.

b. California Residents. Your California Privacy Rights: Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to Third-Parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the Third-Parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Red Roof does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with Third-Parties for those Third-Parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Red Roof provides you with a choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with Third-Parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Red Roof offers that choice, Red Roof does not share your information with that identified Third-Party for its direct marketing purposes.
If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with Third-Parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request by email to privacy@redroof.com. You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email.
