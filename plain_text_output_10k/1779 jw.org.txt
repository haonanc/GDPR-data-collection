 RESPECTING YOUR PRIVACY
We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Policy sets out the basis on which any personal data that we collect from you or that you provide to us will be processed on our website. We keep certain basic information when you visit our website and recognize the importance of keeping that information secure and letting you know what we will do with it. You may choose to provide us with information that is considered personal data. The term “personal data” as used in this Policy refers to information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, or any other data that can be used to identify you. You are not required to provide any personal information to browse the public areas of this website. The term “website” includes this website and our associated sites, such as apps.jw.org , tv.jw.org , stream.jw.org , and wol.jw.org .
 DATA CONTROLLER INFORMATION
This website is owned by Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (“Watchtower”), a New York not-for-profit corporation that supports the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses and their Bible education. If you voluntarily decide to open an account, make a donation, request a free Bible study, or otherwise take any action that involves providing personal data, you consent to this Policy, as well as to the storage of your data on servers located in the United States of America and to the collection, processing, transfer, and storage of your personal data by Watchtower and cooperating organizations that support Jehovah’s Witnesses in various countries as needed to process your requested action. The religious organization operates globally through various local entities. For data protection purposes, these may include local congregations, branch offices, and other similar cooperating organizations of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
The data controller for your personal data varies depending on the nature of your interaction with the website. For example, if you donate to a legal entity in a particular country, your name and contact information will be provided to that legal entity as identified to you during the donation process. As another example, if you request a Bible study, your name and contact information will be provided to a local branch office and congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses to fulfill your request.
To assist you, if the country you reside in has applicable data protection laws, you may find the contact information for the country you reside in on the Data Protection Contacts page.
 DATA SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
We take the security and confidentiality of your personal data very seriously. We use up-to-date data storage and security techniques to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, unlawful destruction, or accidental loss. All processors of personal data and any third parties we engage to process your personal information are obligated to respect the confidentiality of your information. We keep your personal data for only as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements.
We protect your personal data during transit using encryption protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). We use computer systems with limited access protocols, housed in facilities using physical, electronic, and procedural security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. We keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorized access.

If you are a minor in the country in which you are accessing our website, you may submit your personal data on this website only with the involvement of your parent(s) or guardian. If you are a parent(s) or guardian and you provide consent for a minor to submit personal data on this website, you agree to this Policy in respect to the minor’s use.
 THIRD-PARTY VENDORS
At times this website will contain links to the website of a third-party vendor we have retained to perform services on our behalf (for example, the filling out of online forms). You will know that you are on a third-party vendor’s website because it will have a different appearance and the address bar on your browser will change. At the time we select third-party vendors, and periodically thereafter, we inspect their privacy and data protection policies to ensure that they meet the same standards we use for our own policies. If you have questions about a third-party vendor’s policies, please see the policy listed on their website.
 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this website, and improving and adding to our existing services. Because of these ongoing changes, as well as changes in the law and the nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. When it proves necessary to change our Policy, we will post any changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it.
