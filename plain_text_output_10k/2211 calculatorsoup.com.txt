CalculatorSoup, LLC                     receives                     certain types of information about general website traffic at CalculatorSoup.com. This does not                     include personally-identifying information, but does include visit frequency, which pages are                     visited, which search terms are used, what domain names (e.g., "google.com" or "facebook.com")                     visitors are coming from and the date and time of each visit. CalculatorSoup, LLC gathers and                     compiles this                     information into an aggregate form for web traffic analysis. This analysis is related to website                     activity overall rather than on an individual level and does not include personally-identifiable                     information.

Also,                     when an error occurs in a website script (e.g. a calculator) an error message is sent to                     CalculatorSoup, LLC support email address                     with details regarding that error along with the origin IP address which in most cases is the user's                     IP address.
