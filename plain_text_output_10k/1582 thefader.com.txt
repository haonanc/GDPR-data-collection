10. The FADER Online Store
The FADER online store (www.shop.thefader.com) is hosted on Shopify Inc. Shopify provides us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.
Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. Shopify stores your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted.
All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.  PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
Shopify also allows you to make purchases of our products using your PayPal account.  PayPal uses encryption and other technologies to secure your personal information.  For more information on PayPal's security measures, please visit https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security.
