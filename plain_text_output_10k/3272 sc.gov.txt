SC.gov is a creation and a service of the State of South Carolina ("State"). It is operated and managed under a long-term contract with a private company, South Carolina Interactive, LLC ("SCI" or "South Carolina Interactive"). The term "we" in this policy refers to the State and SCI.

What Information Do We Collect?
SC.gov collects from users only the personal information necessary to provide the information and services requested by them.   For example, some of our hosted online service applications require us to  collect names, addresses, email addresses, date of birth, financial information, social security number, and identification credentials such as driver license number, military identification number, or passport number.  The Father Registry site collects information about fathers and mothers and the potential child.  The information collected includes name, address, DOB, and race.  For the child, there is also a date and state of conception and birth state.
To customize our service for you, we and our partners may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used only to provide and improve our service. We may obtain your consent on your first use of the service.
How Do We Use Your Personal Information?
Personal information in our possession is maintained and used in ways that respect individual privacy.  Employees are educated about the importance of protecting personal information and consumer privacy, and only authorized employees and third parties (as specifically described in this policy) are officially granted access to personal information.
SC.gov will not disclose personal information collected from users to private third parties unless the law requires such disclosure or as otherwise described in this policy.  Laws do exist in the State of South Carolina to ensure government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by a government agency.  At the same time, however, there are exceptions to the public's right to access certain records in order to preserve the privacy of individuals.  Such exceptions are authorized by both State and Federal law. Information collected from users by SC.gov, similarly to information collected during in-person visits to a government office, may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption exists in law. In the event there is a conflict between this Privacy Statement and a State or Federal law governing the disclosure of public records, the applicable law shall control.
Data in the Aggregate: We may disclose "blinded" aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties.  Blinded data is data that does not identify an individual person.
Other: We also may disclose your information in special cases.  For example, when we believe that we must disclose information to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy, or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other website users, or anyone else who may be harmed by such activities. We may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our products and services.
We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, delivering or mailing, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, and processing data.  We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are contractually prohibited from using that information for any other reason.
How Can I Control My Personal Information?
We make every effort to develop applications that do not require the transmission or storage of personal information and sensitive data.  SC.gov has developed and maintains online service applications in partnership with SC government entities.  Some of these online service applications require users' personal information per South Carolina statute.  Applications that require end user authentication provide the ability for users to view and edit their personal information using their user account credentials.  When the collection, transmission, and store of sensitive data is required, all data is encrypted.
Family Privacy Protection Act of 2002
The Family Privacy Protection Act of 2002 prohibits persons or private entities from using personal information obtained from State agencies for commercial solicitation purposes.  A person knowingly violating this prohibition is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties specified in S.C. Code Ann. Section 30-2-50(D).
For general use or browsing of SC.gov, visitors are not asked for personally identifiable information, and none will be collected.
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information and should not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to the website as part of a user profile or personalization profile.  If you are a child under the age of 13, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians.  Seek guidance from your parents or guardians if you are under the age of 13.
If we decide to begin collecting personal information from children under the age of 13, we will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use of it.  We will seek verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information.  If we do collect such information, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child's information, and, if they choose, prohibit us from making further use of their child's information. We will not provide personal information about children to third parties.

Security Policy
SC.gov is a creation and a service of the State of South Carolina ("State"). It is operated and managed under a long-term contract with a private company, South Carolina Interactive, LLC ("SCI" or "South Carolina Interactive"). The term "we" in this policy refers to the State and SCI.
SC.gov uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to safeguard your sensitive personal information, including your credit card number, during online transactions.  SSL protocol is the industry's accepted form of encryption and it provides the highest level of protection possible for Internet communications.   SSL applies encryption between two computers, in this case the individual's personal computer and the SC.gov server.  SC.gov utilizes 128-bit encryption, which is one of the stronger standard encryptions currently in the marketplace.  Your transaction is secure from start to finish using this widely accepted form of encryption.  A web browser will automatically activate the appropriate security features when initiating a transaction on SC.gov. On most browsers, an unbroken key or locked padlock icon at the bottom of the browser screen indicates that a secure connection is in place.
The SC.gov processing servers are located behind a firewall and a web application firewall that employs security features. Your credit card information is not stored on a state government database.  If you have trouble purchasing securely at our website, then you may be behind a firewall or using a proxy server that doesn't allow for secure transactions.

Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective partners regarding financial matters are provided in the aggregate only and do not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user.   We will transfer your credit card number, bank account number, or other personal information to the appropriate credit card company or bank in order to process any online payments.  We do not store credit card information or electronic check account information one the payment transaction is completed.  When the collection, transmission, and store of sensitive data are required, all data is encrypted.
