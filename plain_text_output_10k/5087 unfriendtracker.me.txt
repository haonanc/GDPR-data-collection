In addition, we store  certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use  session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser.

We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features. In most cases, we retain it so that, for  instance, you can return to view the changes in your data over time. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a  reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

5.  Sharing Your Information with Third Parties
Any information that you post to your account will not be viewable to other Users.
We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host  the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about UnfriendTracker, to remove repetitive information from our user lists,  to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business  operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we  utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information  to the UnfriendTracker-specified purposes.  UnfriendTracker may provide your personal information to third parties with whom they have a business relationship for  the purposes of securing the services and products you have requested or provide you with additional marketing materials from which you may choose additional products  or services.  UnfriendTracker may make your personal information available to companies or other entities not affiliated with the UnfriendTracker that have goods,  services and offers that might be of interest to you so that they may send you these offers or present them to you.
We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal  information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally,  we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal  activity perpetrated through the UnfriendTracker service or using the UnfriendTracker name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information  with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
If the ownership of all or substantially all of the UnfriendTracker business, or individual business units owned by UnfriendTracker, were to change, your user  information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. UnfriendTracker further reserves the right to disclose, transfer or sell your  personal information to companies who are affiliated with UnfriendTracker in UnfriendTracker's sole discretion.  If UnfriendTracker changes ownership through an  acquisition, merger, sale or other change of business status, it reserves the right to transfer or assign the right to use your personal information collected.
6.  Links
UnfriendTracker may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware  when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to  information collected by UnfriendTracker.
7.  Third Party Advertising
Advertisements that appear on UnfriendTracker are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. They automatically receive your  IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and  "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network  to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.  In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are  clicked. UnfriendTracker does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have no access  to your contact information stored on UnfriendTracker unless you choose to share it with them.
This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by UnfriendTracker and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.
8.  Changing or Removing Information
Most User Submissions are not editable once submitted, but can be updated.  Most User Submissions on a user account can be changed or deleted by contacting customer service or using the UI.   Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time.
9.  Security
UnfriendTracker takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall.   Because email is not recognized as a secure form of communication, we request that you not send private information to us by email. If you have any questions about  the security of UnfriendTracker Web Site, please contact us via the contact page.
