We will use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our         site, fill orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically         analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site's         content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to         deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices.

When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate         and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a         Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that         can later be retrieved to identify you to us. The cookies make your use of the site         easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. In the event that your browser request that we do not track you or store a cookie, our website is unable to honor such requests.
We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on our         site. As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your computer.         We will not provide any such third-party ad server with your Personally Identifiable         Information. In addition, other advertisers may also place banner ads on our site,         and we will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to them.
 
WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION:
Other than your credit or debit card information (which we will only share with         third parties as described below), we may share your Personally Identifiable Information         with third parties in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable         state and federal law. We provide the products and services offered on our website         through contractual arrangements with affiliates, service providers, and other third         parties. We and such third parties use your Personally Identifiable Information         to operate our sites and to deliver their products and services.
For example, we must release your credit card or debit card information to the card-issuing         bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this site; release         your Personally Identifiable Information to the third party that will provide the         products or services that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties         that help us provide customer service. We will encourage our service providers to         adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable         Information by our service providers is governed by the privacy policies of those         service providers, and is not subject to our control.
We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers'         sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers,         but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.
Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide         Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities.         We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order,         subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate         with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal         activities.
