How we protect your privacy
In order to provide you with the best possible platform for online course creation we collect and process quite a bit of information. The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you better understand how we store, collect, and process your personal data. This policy is meant to help you understand more about why we collect and use your data whether you’re a Thinkific customer or a student/subscriber to a Thinkific site who uses the Thinkific application or services (together known as, “The Services”), a participant in Thinkific’s partner or affiliate program, or even if you’re just visiting the Thinkific website.
