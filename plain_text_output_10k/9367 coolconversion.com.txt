2. Use of the Subscription Service by HiConversion and our Customers
2.1. The HiConversion Subscription Service
Our online Subscription Service allows any company that uses it (our customers and HiConversion itself) to track website visitor actions and to run website optimization experiments, and produce many reports about visitor behavior and preferences. This information, which is stored and managed on our service providers’ servers, is then used so that the visitors can be targeted with content and offerings in accordance with anticipated interest in the company’s goods or services and interact with the company. HiConversion provides the Subscription Service to our customers for their web analytics and customer experience optimization needs, and we use it on our Websites for our own technology for the same purposes.
2.2. Use by HiConversion
We use our own Subscription Service to build webpages that people can visit to learn more about HiConversion. Information that we collect and manage using the Subscription Service for our own needs belongs to us and is used, disclosed and protected according to this Privacy Policy.
2.3. Use by Our Customers
Our customers use the Subscription Service to collect web analytics data and / or to run customer experience optimization campaigns to learn more about visitor behavior and preferences and to deliver effective content and website functionality that produces better results. HiConversion does not control the content of optimization campaigns or the types of information that our customers may choose to collect or manage using the Subscription Service. That information belongs to them and is used, disclosed and protected by them according to their privacy policies and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. HiConversion processes our customers’ information as they direct and in accordance with our agreements with our customers, and we store it on our service providers’ servers, but we do not have control over its collection or management. Our agreements with our customers prohibit us from using that information, except as necessary to provide and improve the Subscription Service, as permitted by this Privacy Policy, and as required by law. We have no direct relationship with individuals who provide Personal Information to our customers. Our customers control and are responsible for correcting, deleting or updating information they have collected from you using the Subscription Service. We may work with our customers to help them provide notice to their visitors about their data collection, processing and usage.

5. Navigational Information
5.1. Cookies
We use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages on our Websites, or register for the Subscription Service, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. When you return to the same Website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the customized features.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the HiConversion Subscription Service or Websites you visit. HiConversion keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within HiConversion, in order to determine what portion of the HiConversion Website or Subscription Service is the most popular or most used. This data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the HiConversion Website and Subscription Service to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
5.2. Log Files
We may collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites using log files that are not associated with your name or other personally identifying information. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by us. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by HiConversion for the operation of the Subscription Service, to maintain quality of the Subscription Service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the HiConversion Website. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to Personal Information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.
5.3. Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website and Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers’ Personal Information. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Opting Out and Unsubscribing”.
5.4. Navigational Information Collected by Our Customers
Our customers can use the tools we provide, as well as tools provided by third parties, to collect Navigational Information when you visit their webpages on the Subscription Service. HiConversion does not control our customers’ use of these tools, nor do we control the information they collect or how they use it.
5.5. Single Sign-On
You can log in to our site using a Single Sign-on (SSO) service like your Google account. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Such services may give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
5.6. Flash Cookies and Other Third Party Tracking Technologies
The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser. This technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as “Flash cookies.” HiConversion does not use Flash cookies. However, our customers of our software platform may create pages on the HiConversion platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies. HiConversion does not have access or control over our customers’ Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe’s web site directly.   Similarly, our customers may create pages using the HiConversion Subscription Service that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons.   The use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies.
5.7. Advertising
We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here http://preferences.truste.com/. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
5.8. Third Party Tracking Technologies
The use of cookies and web beacons by any tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these third party tracking technologies
