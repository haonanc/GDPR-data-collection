Privacy and Security Notice
Thank you for visiting the PACER Service Center Web Site and         reviewing our Privacy and Security Notice.
Privacy
The PACER Service Center values your privacy.  If you visit          our site to read or download information, we collect and store the following information:
The name of the domain from which you access the Internet.
The date and time you access our site.
PACER staff will not give, sell or transfer any personal          information to third parties, except in the following cases:
To secure payment of delinquent fees, identifying             information may be transmitted to a collection agency.
If compelled by law.
If you direct us to do so.
In other legally limited circumstances             (for example, to protect your account from fraud).
For billing purposes, when you access court documents, we          keep track of basic information about each transaction, such          as the account, court, document type, search criteria,          case number, time, date and number of pages. We also use          session cookies to identify users. We will not provide this          information to anyone, except for the situations set out above.
You also may decide to send us personal identifying          information--your mailing address, for example--in a request          for information. Information collected in this manner is used          solely for responding to requests for information. You should NEVER send your PACER password to us in an electronic mail          message.
When making payment by check, your check will be converted from          a paper transaction to an electronic funds transfer in most cases.          The conversion will be made by our authorized financial          institution, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Treasury,                    which  contains information on negative check information or          failed Automated Clearing House (ACH) debit entry transactions          for certain checks that have been presented electronically to          Federal agencies.  Federal agencies will have access to check          verification databases to determine the validity and/or check          writing history of the payor. FMS will not disclose information          from the Master Verification for purposes of check verification.           Information may be used for law enforcement purposes and for          other routine uses, such as systems development          (See 68 Fed Reg. 5691 (2003) for a complete list of possible          uses).  Making payment by check is voluntary but a decision not          to do so will require you to make payment by some other method.
For site management, information is collected for statistical          purposes, such as assessing the number of visitors to the          different sections of our site, identifying what information          is of most and least interest, determining technical design          specifications, and identifying system performance or problem          areas.  This information will be kept confidential.
Any attempt to collect data from PACER in a manner which avoids           billing is strictly prohibited and may result in criminal           prosecution or civil action.  PACER privileges will be terminated           if, in the judgment of judiciary personnel, they are being misused.            Misuse includes, but is not limited to, using an automated process           to repeatedly access those portions of the PACER application that           do not assess a fee  (i.e. calendar events report or case header           information) for purposes of collecting case information).             PACER account usage will be monitored for inappropriate use.
