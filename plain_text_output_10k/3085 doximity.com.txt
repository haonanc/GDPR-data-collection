1. Personal Information Collected
Doximity collects publicly available information about physicians in a database to provide a directory and referral service to other healthcare professionals. This information includes your name, office address, office phone and fax numbers, specialty, and the medical school and training institutions you attended. Almost all doctors, and many other healthcare professionals, are included in our database. If you choose to register and become a User, you will verify that the information that we have collected about you is accurate.
The purpose of the Doximity service is to permit Users to add to the publicly available information about themselves in order to develop, maintain and enhance a network of professional contacts. Users may provide us certain personal information, such as your affiliations and work history, which we collect and publish in order to allow you to enhance your network of contacts.
If you have any hesitation about providing such information to us and/or having such information displayed on the Doximity website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you may refrain from providing this information. The only information that you are required to provide in order to become a member of Doximity is your email address. By default, your email address is not published in your Doximity profile, and we will use it only to send you product updates and information. You can, of course, opt not to receive these updates.
If an authorized third party, such as an administrator in your office, completes the registration form on your behalf, both you and that third party will be deemed to have accepted all of the terms of this Privacy Policy.
We collect personal information from you at the following times:
When You Register
The following fields are required during registration to guarantee the Doximity network is a useful directory for its members: name, address, specialty, office phone, occupation, email address and password. Physicians are required to additionally enter or confirm medical school, year of graduation and birthday. Most of this information, other than your email address, will already be included in your profile, but we ask that you verify that the information is correct, and update it where necessary. We use your medical school year of graduation and birthday in order to verify that you are a physician.
We also give you the option to provide the following information: subspecialty, title/practice, clinical areas of interest, maiden name, languages spoken at your office, and profile photo. Providing such information is completely optional and choosing not to provide this information will not affect your ability to browse the Doximity directory or use the Doximity service.
All of the information that is publicly available or you voluntarily provide will be included in your profile, which is accessible to anyone browsing the Doximity directory, except your birth year, year you graduated from medical school, and your email address.
When You Add a Public Profile
Once you have completed the registration process, you may at any time provide additional information to your profile. Such information includes: medical group, IPA and hospital affiliations, internship, residency program, fellowships, work history, presentations, publications, education, professional interests, memberships, and board certifications. Providing additional information is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the Doximity system to build and leverage your professional network.
All of the information that is publicly available or you voluntarily provide will be published in your profile, which is accessible to anyone browsing the Doximity directory, except the year(s) you graduated from your internship, residency and/or fellowship programs. Any information you provide to us, whether during the registration process or as an update to your Profile, may be used in the same manner and extent to which other information is permitted to be used hereunder, including for the purpose of serving advertisements through the service.
When You Add a Private Profile
If you choose, you may fill out a private profile on Doximity. The private profile can consist of back line, mobile phone, home phone, other phone, pager, inpatient/admit number, email address or other private note.
Your private profile is visible only to those confirmed colleagues with whom you select to share it.
When You Invite Others to Join Doximity
If you wish to invite your colleagues to join Doximity, you can use our service to fax invitations to their offices. In this case, no additional information about you or your colleagues is collected.
Alternatively, you may enter their names and email addresses, which Doximity will use to send your invitation including a message that you write. The names and email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation and reminders.
When You Contact Customer Support
Doximity may collect information through our website or through Customer Support in order to, among other things, accurately categorize and respond to your inquiry and deliver appropriate service levels.
Cookies
Like most websites, Doximity uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows Doximity to recognize you as a User when you return to the Doximity website using the same computer and web browser. Like the information you enter at registration or when you update your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on our website. One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your Doximity account. The next time you visit the Doximity website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the service. However, if you log out of the Doximity website you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing User preferences and tracking User trends. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer and mobile device
Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Doximity website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Doximity. Doximity also receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, mobile device operating system (if you are accessing Doximity using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We use this information to analyze overall trends to help improve the service. The linkage between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission, except as described in Section 2 (“Legal Disclaimer” and “Disclosures to Others”), below.
Consent to Doximity Processing Information About You
Certain information you provide to Doximity may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, religion or other aspects of your private life, and more generally about you. Please be aware that in providing information to Doximity for the purposes of opening your user account, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Doximity’s User Agreement. The supplying of all such information by you to Doximity, including all information deemed "personal" or “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.
Rights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You
You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data about you, which has been collected pursuant to your decision to become a User. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information which you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented herein. We take your rights seriously and encourage you to use them if you deem this to be appropriate. You may exercise these rights by emailing us at support@doximity.com or by contacting us at:

2. Uses of Personal Information
Doximity is an online service dedicated to helping medical professionals more effectively connect with one another. The information you choose to provide about yourself on our service is used to help you describe yourself to other Users. If you close your Doximity account, we will remove all of the personal information that you have provided to Doximity from our publicly viewable database, as well as any private profile information that you have stored with us. We will retain the publicly available data in the database, including all of the information about you that was available on our database prior to your joining the Doximity network. Other information, that does not personally identify you as an individual, is collected by Doximity from Users (such as, for example, patterns of utilization) and is exclusively owned by Doximity. This information can be utilized by Doximity in such manner as Doximity, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
Doximity's Communications to You
Doximity will communicate with you through email, fax and notices posted on the Doximity website or through other means available through the service, including text and other forms of messaging. If we send any communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with any such access (including text messaging charges for messages to your mobile device). Our communications to you include emails which help inform Users about various features of the service. Doximity may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. You can change your email and contact preferences at any time by sending a request to support@doximity.com or by updating your profile information.
Customized Content
Information provided to Doximity (or to third parties with whom it offers combined services) is also used to customize your experience on our website. For example, you can store “favorite” phone numbers for easy reference.
Sharing Information with Third Parties
Doximity takes the privacy of Users very seriously. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your private information to third parties for marketing or other purposes. We may provide data about the usage of our services with third party service providers with whom we contract to help us provide our Services. For example, we may work with vendors, consultants or other third parties to host and maintain our data and website properties, analyze our data, or provide marketing assistance. All contracted third parties must agree not to use your personal information and communications other than to fulfill their responsibilities to us and are bound by confidentiality agreements with regard to their use of such information.  We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of our services to third parties for such purposes as we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective investors in Doximity. We may segment our Users by specialty, education, alumni groups, training, research, grants, trials, geographic location or other similar information and provide information from your public profile as part of our Services and product offerings. If you would like to be excluded from the aggregated research or products based upon aggregated or segmented data and Users’ activities on the site, please email support@doximity.com .
As part of our Services, we may share personal information with accredited Continuing Medical Education (CME) and Continuing Education (CE) providers who certify CME and CE activities, to process CME or CE activities you may choose to take through our Service.
As part of our Services, we may also share public profile information with medical leading publications and ranking bodies, such as U.S. News and World Reports to increase the visibility of our Users.
When you use the Doximity Service through a Doximity website, newsletter, mobile app or other medium, you may be presented with advertisements or opportunities to engage in informational programs consisting of sponsor-selected content. Examples of these programs include sponsored news alerts or branded or unbranded discussion groups. All sponsored programs will be labeled clearly as sponsored.
When you choose to engage with a sponsored program, such as engaging with a commercial client’s sponsored news alert, we may provide our commercial clients with your identifiable information and information about the type of engagement (e.g., whether you viewed, interacted with or requested information about such promotional content). We will only share your identifiable information with clients who have agreed to use such information solely for authorized purposes.
To confirm, we will not provide your personal contact information such as email, phone, fax, or postal address as part of our Services.
You may revoke your authorization to participate in these features of our Services at anytime.  If you would like to be excluded from the accredited bodies, leading publications or commercial features of our Services, please email support@doximity.com .
Finding Colleagues
We use your information, including the addresses you import through our contact importers, to make suggestions to you and other users on Doximity. For example, if another user imports the same email address as you do, we may suggest that you add each other as colleagues.
To help your friends find you, we allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including through contact importers and search.
Search
We offer search services to help you find information and learn more about other Users (for example, you can search for Users with particular expertise, or that you may know from your medical school). We use information from User profiles and other contributions to Doximity to inform and refine our search service.
Surveys and Polls
As a User, you may receive requests to participate in market research including polls and surveys submitted by other Doximity members. If you participate in surveys and polls offered through our website, the information you provide may be visible to others using the Doximity website. You may opt-out of participating by emailing support@doximity.com to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.
Communications to other Users
Communications you initiate through Doximity, such as a colleague invitation sent to a non-User, will list your name in the message, along with your current office address and phone/fax numbers. No other contact information will be included in the message.
Doximity members may communicate with one another using the Doximity DocMail feature. DocMail messages may only be initiated between two users who have confirmed a colleague relationship within the Doximity network. In the case where a User has initiated a group message to two or more of his or her colleagues, recipients of this group message may “reply all” to the recipients of this group message, even though they are not all colleagues. This is the only instance where a User may receive a DocMail from a non-colleague. DocMail messages may be sent Secure or non-Secure. Secure messages require recipients to confirm their identity by entering their PIN code prior to viewing. Non-Secure messages may be read by anyone with access to a User’s mobile device.
You can disable DocMail at any time in Settings. You can disable “push” notifications of new DocMail messages at any time through the settings on your mobile device.
Legal Disclaimer
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, such as responses to civil or criminal subpoenas, or other requests by law enforcement personnel. We will disclose such information when we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, subpoena, or other legal process or request to Doximity brought in any country throughout the world, or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
Disclosures to others
We may also disclose your personal and other information you provide, to another third party as part of a reorganization or a sale of substantially all of the business of Doximity. Any third party to which we transfer or sell Doximity’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.
Accessing and Changing Your Account Information
You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your Doximity account, including your email and contact preferences, at any time by emailing  support@doximity.com  You can also make these changes on the Doximity website by updating your Profile. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, Doximity may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.
Closing Your Account
You can also close your account at any time by emailing  support@doximity.com  If you close your Doximity account, we will remove all of the information that you have provided to Doximity from our publicly viewable database, as well as any private profile information that you have stored with us. We will retain the publicly available data in the database, including all of the information about you that was available on our database prior to your joining the Doximity network. We may also retain certain data contributed by you if we believe it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.
Doximity may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person's inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, communications to other Users, as well as your contributions to iRounds and DocNews or other communications, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. This includes personal health information that you communicate through the Doximity Services. Doximity disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Doximity does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from Doximity's publicly viewable database.
To request that we close your account and remove your information from the Doximity website, please send your request to  support@doximity.com  Please send your request using an email account that you have registered with Doximity under your name. You will receive a response within five business days of its receipt.
Memorializing Accounts
If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User's account. In these cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User's next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.
As a User, you have certain obligations toward the other Users with whom you will be communicating. Certain of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of like-minded members, such as Doximity:
You must, at all times, respect the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and the User Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights which may belong to third parties (such as photographs).
You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information which may be deemed to be injurious, defamatory, violent, offensive, racist, sexist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of Doximity and its community of Users.
You must not provide information to Doximity and /or other Users which you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person, professional or social status.
You must use our free peer-to-peer invite and secure message system for clinical, not commercial use. While we do allow selected client outreach for partner information, market research, expert witness, and career opportunities, these messages have a distinct format and channel-level opt-outs to protect our members. Those found soliciting, scamming, or spamming other members will be removed or suspended from the network at our sole discretion.
Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account by Doximity, as we take these principles seriously and consider them to be the basis on which our Users adhere to the Doximity website and the services which it offers.

BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 generally requires that covered entities and business associates enter into contracts to ensure that the business associates will appropriately safeguard protected health information.  A business associate contract serves to clarify and limit, as appropriate, the permissible uses and disclosures of protected health information by the business associate, based on the relationship between the parties and the activities or services being performed by the business associate.  You and Doximity agree to the terms of the business associates agreement provided in Exhibit A relating to any communications of electronic protected health information.
