Introduction
Questia is committed to safeguarding the personal information of our customers         and online visitors. Please read the following policy to understand         the treatment of your personal information and what options you have to direct our         activities.
By registering or using the QuestiaSM service, or accessing any Questia         website, you agree to the terms of our privacy policy.
Specific questions or comments regarding this policy should be directed to Questia         by sending us an email . A complete         description of your rights and duties concerning use of this site is given in our User Agreements .
1. Information collected
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to enable us to provide you         with an efficient, customized experience while you use the Questia service. To fully         use our service, you will need to register using our online registration             form where you will be required to provide certain personal information.
Once you register, you can use your account page to review         and change the information that you submitted during registration at any time.
Upon request we will remove your personal information from our operational databases         (unless your account is in dispute, in which case it will be kept until the dispute         is resolved). In order to remove information, please contact us .         Technical constraints and the fact that we back up our system may prevent the total         elimination of all of your personally identifying information.
Occasionally we solicit additional information from you through the use of optional         questionnaires. None of this additional information is required for your continued         use of our service.
In addition to the information we require for registration, we automatically track         certain information about you based upon your use of our site. This information         may include websites you come from and go to from ours, what browser you are using,         your IP address and what searches you perform in our service. This information is         compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.
On certain pages of our site, and with certain features of our service, we use cookies.         You are always free to decline our         cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may be required to reenter         your password more frequently during a session, and may not experience a fully-customized         experience.
If you send us personal correspondence or if other users or third parties send us         correspondence about your activities, we may collect such information into a file         specific to you.
2. Control of your password
You may not disclose or share your Questia password with any third party. If you         lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personally         identifying information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your         behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should         immediately change it on your account page .
Use of your information
We use your personally identifying information and information about your usage         internally to improve our services. We may use your contact information to send         you administrative/renewal notices or information on new services, promotions, and         targeted advertisements. While you may not opt out of the administrative/renewal         notices, you may do so for the promotional ones by choosing this preference on your             account page .
While it is not our practice to monitor or review material you store on our site,         we may access this information for system maintenance, troubleshooting activities, or legal reasons. The information that we place in the file that we maintain about         you, including your current and past activities on our site, may also be used for         similar purposes.
4. Disclosure of collected data
Advertisers.We aggregate information and disclose this information to advertisers         and use it for other marketing and promotional purposes. We do not disclose to third         parties any information that could reasonably be used to personally identify or         contact you.
Co-Branded Service Providers.Questia offers its users and subscribers the         opportunity to use a number of third-party services from our site (e.g., moderated         chat). If you choose to use these optional services, we will provide only so much         of your personal information as is necessary to affect your use of the Co-Branded         Service Providers' services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of         these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use         their services.
Suppliers and Other Service Providers.We may use third-party Suppliers         and Service Providers to facilitate some of our services. In some instances, the         Service Provider may collect information directly from you (e.g. we ask a Service         Provider to conduct a survey for us). In these cases, all information disclosures         you make will be strictly optional, and we contractually restrict how they may access,         use and disclose your information. We do not permit the sale of your information         to third parties by these Suppliers and Other Service Providers.
Questia Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures.We may share our data or transfer         assets, including personally identifying information about you, with our corporate         parent and subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other entities that are in common control         with Questia. To the extent that these entities are given access to your information,         they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain         from their other users. As our business develops we may purchase another organization         and, in so doing, acquire customer information that will be protected by the guidelines         set forth by this privacy policy.
Disclosure of Customer Information Through Business Transfers. As our business         develops we may purchase another organization and, in so doing, acquire customer         information. Also, in the event that Questia transfers its assets to our corporate         parent or to one or more subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other entities in common         control, or sells all or substantially all of our assets to a third party, customer         information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
Legal Requests.We may decide or be required to disclose information to         law enforcement, other government authorities, or third parties under certain circumstances.         We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you that we, in         our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate, in connection with an         investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, third-party         lawsuits, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
5. Other information collectors
In addition to the information we require for registration, Questia also contracts         with third parties to help us understand how people use our web site and to provide         functionalities such as email distribution, ad serving and customer surveys. These         companies also use cookies. They may also use other tracking technologies, such         as web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, web bugs, tracking pixels or action tags),         which are similar in function to cookies, allowing them to determine when users         have reached particular web pages on the Questia site.
6. A special note about children
Questia meets the terms set forth by the Children's Online Privacy Protection         Act of 1998 (COPPA). Except for students who use our services through a school-based         subscription, we do not knowingly collect information online from children under         the age of 13. Additionally, we never gather any information from the children who         are using it through their school that could be used to contact them individually.         Parents are allowed at any time to access the information that we have collected         on their child. We do not condition a child's or school's participation in any activity         by requiring them to provide more information about themselves. For questions specifically         regarding the privacy of children on our site, please contact             Customer Service .
7. A special note about non-U.S. subscribers
If you are a non-U.S. citizen, by subscribing to the Questia service or by providing         any personally identifying information as a non-subscriber, you explicitly grant         us the right to transfer that information to the United States Government.
8. Security
Questia uses industry standard efforts to safeguard your personally identifying         information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers (SSL). However, "perfect         security" does not exist on the Internet and third parties may intercept or access         transmissions and/or private communications. Therefore, we do not promise, and you         should not expect, that your personally identifying information or private communications         would remain private in all cases. Nevertheless, we will make every effort to make         sure that we keep your information safe.
9. Changes to this privacy policy
We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy, and recommend that         you visit it often. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we will         notify you by posting them here.
