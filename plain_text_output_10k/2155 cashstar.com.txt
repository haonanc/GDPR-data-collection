Last Updated: May 1, 2018
Introduction and Scope of Practices.
Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates (“Blackhawk,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) care about your personal information.  This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the personal data we collect, how we use this data, with whom we share it, and the choices individuals have about our use of this data.  The Policy applies to the personal data Blackhawk collects about users of our websites (including www.blackhawknetwork.com) mobile applications, and the services and features therein (together the “Sites”), as well as the data we collect in providing our services (the “Services”) and when individuals communicate with us about our Sites and Services,  whether in person, by telephone, by mail, or other means, unless you are notified at the time we collect your personal data that a different privacy policy applies. When we act as a data processor on behalf of another controller, we collect, use, and disclose certain personal data only under the controller’s instruction, and their privacy policy will apply to how they (and we on their behalf) process your personal data.
This Policy explains:
How we collect, use, and share information from or about you;
How our online advertisements (such as banner ads) on third party sites treat data;
Your choices about our use of your personal data;
How you can access and update your information; and
How you can exercise your rights
Sometimes, we appear on a site owned by a third party (like a Blackhawk page or handle on a social media site) or link to a third party site. When we do, that third party’s privacy policies and terms of use, not ours, will apply unless you are told otherwise. Also, some of Blackhawk’s Services are offered through banks or other financial institutions. In those cases, the third parties’ policies will govern their use of consumer data.
How We Collect Personal Data
“Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person or a combination of information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a specific person. We may collect Personal Data directly from you, when you provide it to us. This can occur when you fill out applications, create accounts, complete a purchase, add money to your account, send in forms, take surveys, or fill in various online fields on our Sites. We also collect Personal Data when you contact us with inquiries, customer support requests, or employment applications.  You do not have to provide us with your Personal Data.  However, if you choose not to disclose certain information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services, such as retaining shopping cart choices.
We may also collect the Personal Data of third parties when you provide it to us. For example, if you choose to use our service to send a gift to a friend or register a family member for an account, we will ask you for their name and address or email address. In addition, we may collect third party Personal Data through our "Refer a Friend" program. Blackhawk stores this information for the sole purpose of completing the transaction. If you provide Personal Data of a friend or family member and they want us to delete this information, they should contact us at privacy@bhnetwork.com . We may not always be able to remove their Personal Data and we will let them know if we cannot do so and why.

If we cannot collect this data, we may be unable to on-board you as a client or provide products or services to you.
Comments, Posts and Submissions
When you submit online forms, participate in surveys, contests, promotions, or sweepstakes, join online chat discussions, request customer support, submit testimonials, we collect your Personal Data, such as contact information, and other information you choose to share.

If you do, you might not be able to use certain features, especially when we use location-based information to prevent fraud.

Most browsers collect certain information, such as your IP address, device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and internet browser type and version. This information is gathered automatically and stored in log files. We may link this data to Personal Information we have collected about you.

"Do Not Track" Preferences
Many browsers provide you an option to request that a web application disable either its tracking and/or cross site user tracking of an individual user. We do not track your online activities across different Sites, and we only track your activity within a Site to the extent you log into your account. Therefore, our practices remain the same whether or not you enable the "Do Not Track" feature. You may, however, disable certain tracking by third-parties as discussed in our Cookie Policy .
Third-Party Analytics

This Policy does not cover such uses of data by third parties.

EU Data Subject Rights

Object to Processing
You have the right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds, where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process Personal Information.  If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

International Transfer
If you live in the European Economic Area ("EEA") or in Canada, the data that we collect from you may be transferred to, or accessed in, and stored at a location outside the EEA and Canada that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. When Blackhawk stores personal data outside the EEU, the data will be stored in the United States.  We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it, including through appropriate written data processing terms and/or data transfer agreements, by putting in place standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission (the form for the standard contractual clauses can be found here: EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses ) or where there is an adequacy decision by the EU Commission. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA and Canada who work for us or for one of our service providers.

We will ensure that your Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

Blackhawk is responsible for the processing of Personal Data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Blackhawk complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of Personal Data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
With respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Blackhawk is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Blackhawk may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We commit to cooperate in the resolution of disputes with individuals through this process.

Updates to This Policy
This Policy may be subject to change. Please review it from time to time.
