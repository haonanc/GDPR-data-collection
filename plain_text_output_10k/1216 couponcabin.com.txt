Coupa’s Privacy Policy
Coupa is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. In this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"), we explain how Coupa collects, uses, discloses and protects the Personal Information you submit to us, including, for example, when accessing and using Coupa websites or applying for job offerings.
Our Privacy Policy has been drafted to comply with applicable data privacy laws, in particular, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). If the GDPR does not apply to you, not all terms of this Privacy Policy may be relevant to you. To learn more about our approach to GDPR compliance, please click here .
As used in this Privacy Policy,
“Coupa”, "we," "our" and "us" means Coupa Software Inc. and its affiliates.
“Controller” for the purposes of the GDPR, other data protection laws applicable in member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is Coupa Software Inc., 1855 S. Grant Street, San Mateo, CA 94402, USA.
“Personal Information” generally has the same meaning as personal data or personal identifiable information (PII). Personal Information is defined in the data privacy laws applicable in your country. It includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This means any individual who can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as name, identification number, location data, online identifiers (for example, IP addresses – if they can be used to identify you) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. Put simply, this includes data which either by itself or with other data held by us or available to us, can be used to identify you.
Coupa is committed to the following key principles:
Principle 1. We limit how, and with whom, we share your Personal Information.
Coupa will only share your Personal Information with others for the following purposes:

to our professional advisers.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE WANT YOU TO KNOW:
Transfers outside the EU/EEA. We also transfer the Personal Information we process to countries outside the European Economic Area (”EEA”) (e.g., when one of our service providers or equipment is based outside the EEA, such as  for hosting your Personal Information). We have put in place adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of your privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of your rights, e.g. we establish an adequate level of data protection, usually through EU Standard Contractual Clauses based on the EU commission’s model clauses.
Provision of Personal Information / Automated decision making. Please note that the Personal Information we collect from you is necessary to providing the services and the website to you. Failure to provide such data may not enable us to provide our services to you or make our website accessible. We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling of individuals.
Your Rights. You have various rights under data privacy laws in your country. These may include (as relevant): the right to request access to the Personal Information we hold about you; the right to rectification including to require us to correct inaccurate Personal Information; the right to request restriction of processing concerning you or to object to processing of your Personal Information, the right to request the erasure of your Personal Information where it is no longer necessary for us to retain it; the right to data portability including to obtain Personal Information in a commonly used machine readable format in certain circumstances such as where our processing of it is based on a consent; the right object to automated decision making including profiling (if any) that has a legal or significant effect on you as an individual; and the right to withdraw your consent to any processing for which you have previously given that consent.
Marketing Information. With your consent, where relevant, we will keep your name, address and contact details (including telephone numbers and email addresses) in our databases and may from time to time use that information to make you aware of our related products and services as well as updates on developments in our industry sector generally which may be of interest to you. We may contact you in writing, by telephone or email for this. If at any time you decide that you do not want your contact details used for these purposes, you may object or revoke your consent for receiving marketing communications by following the instructions in the relevant marketing communication (e.g., clicking on the “Unsubscribe” button) or by contacting us (see “Give Us Your Feedback” above).
Security Statement. We take reasonable precautions to protect your information. In particular, we implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including as appropriate: (a) pseudonymisation (such as where data is separated from direct identifiers so that linkage to an identity is not possible without additional information that is held separately) and encryption, (b) protecting the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of systems and services used to process your Personal Information, (c) providing the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Information in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and (d) maintaining a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational security measures. When you submit information to us through our website, your information is protected both online and offline. All data transferred to/from the Coupa internal network, from/to an external entity, is encrypted to industry standards (256-bit encryption). Please keep in mind that messages you send to us by Internet e-mail may not be secure. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your personal information within our company. Only those employees who may require your information to perform a specific job are granted access to your organization’s identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
