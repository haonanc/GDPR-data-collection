This week Facebook is celebrating Data Privacy Day ( https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/ ). We're launching a new education campaign to help you understand how data is used on Facebook and how you can manage your own data. We're announcing plans to make your core privacy settings easier to find, and we're publishing our privacy principles for the first time. We're also sharing a few quick and easy Facebook privacy tips.
Helping You Take Control of Your Data on Facebook...: Starting this week you'll see educational videos in News Feed that help you get information on important privacy topics like how to control what information Facebook uses to show you ads, how to review and delete old posts, and even what it means to delete your account. We're also running education campaigns off Facebook, including ads on other websites.
Making Privacy Settings Easier to Find: This year, we'll introduce a new privacy center that features core privacy settings in a single place. We're designing this based on feedback from people, policymakers and privacy experts around the world.
Facebook's Privacy Principles: Our efforts to build data protection into our products and give you more information and control reflect principles that guide our thinking on privacy. We're sharing these principles for the first time here ( https://facebook.com/about/basics/privacy-principles ).
A Few Quick Tips: We encourage you to take a few minutes to think about your own privacy choices for Data Privacy Day. Here are some easy things you can do on Facebook:
*Give yourself a privacy checkup: Privacy Checkup helps you review who you're posting to, manage or delete apps you've connected to your account, and edit the privacy of information on your profile.
*Take control of the ads you see: Ad Preferences shows you interests and information that influence the ads you see, and helps you manage this information.
*Run a security checkup: Security Checkup helps you make your account even more secure. You can log out of unused apps, get login alerts and protect your password.
*If you don’t like something, delete it: You can use Facebook’s Activity Log to review your entire timeline and delete old posts.
Privacy is something that we hope everyone thinks about, not just on Data Privacy Day but throughout the year.  We'll also continue to work on improving our privacy tools, and you'll see more announcements about that in the coming months.
