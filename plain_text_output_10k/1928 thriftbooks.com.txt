We also deposit and collect             information from Cookies, as described in more detail in section 10 of this policy. We use this information to             help diagnose problems with and secure our servers, to administer the proper functioning and legitimate use of             our websites, and to improve the nature and marketing of the Services.

When you set up an account with us, we collect your full name and email address and require you to choose             a password (your “Account Information”). You must set up an account with ThriftBooks to order from us or use             other ThriftBooks Services (as explained in our Terms of Use ), and we use the information to identify and administer your account.
When you order from us, we collect your name, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card             number, credit card billing address, credit card expiration date, and credit card verification value (cvv) code             (your "Order Information"). This Order Information is necessary for us to use to process your order, to notify             you of your order status, and to fulfill your orders. We do not save your credit card information unless you             check the box asking us to.
When you order from any third party marketplace of which we are a part (for example, Amazon or Ebay), the             third party marketplace will provide to us certain information, including Order Information, that we will use             to process your order, to notify you of your order status, and to fulfill your orders. We are not responsible             for the terms of the breach of any agreement between you and any third party marketplace, and your personal information             is subject to their policies and ours.
Email messages from ThriftBooks
If you create a ThriftBooks account, ThriftBooks may use your Account Information to send to you email or other communications           containing information about ThriftBooks and other matters ThriftBooks believes will interest you. At any time,           you may alter your communication preferences by logging into your account and choosing the email communications           you want to receive via the Email Preferences menu. Also, each email ThriftBooks sends to you will tell you how           to stop receiving further email from ThriftBooks. Please note that you must receive at least some emails to be           able to place orders. Also, you may not opt out of receiving email containing important information regarding your           rights and responsibilities with respect to our Services.
How we protect your information
In all of our Services, we have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information           under our control. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure           server layer (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect           is similarly protected against unauthorized access. That being said, no measures are guaranteed to be 100% secure.           You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your device and account, including to (1) choose           a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess and (2) keep your log-in and password private. We           are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized           password activity.

For example, we will not tell our business partners that you bought a particular item, but we               may tell those business partners how many customers in demographic groups bought certain items, and your information               may be used to place you in that demographic group.

Transfers of personal information
The Service is hosted and operated in the United States (“U.S.”), through ThriftBooks. If you do not reside in the           U.S., laws in the U.S. (and other countries) may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Service, you           acknowledge that any personal information about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third           party, is being provided to ThriftBooks in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize ThriftBooks           to transfer, store, host and process your information to and in the U.S. and in other countries at the discretion           of ThriftBooks. You consent to transfer of your data to the U.S. pursuant to the standard data protection clauses           promulgated by the EC.
Processing grounds
We will only use your personal information if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include           consent, contractual necessity, and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further           described below.
Contractual necessity
We process some personal information because we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with               you, which enables us to provide you with the ThriftBooks Services (as defined in the Conditions of Use). When               we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such personal information will result in your               inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
Legitimate interest
We may process personal information when we believe doing so furthers our legitimate interest. Our legitimate               interests may include operation and improvement of the Services; marketing the Services; provision of customer               support; protection from fraud or security threats; completion of corporate transactions; and compliance with               legal obligations.
Consent
In some cases, we process personal information based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we               collect such data. When we process personal information based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated               to you at the point and time of collection. To withdraw your consent, please email us at support@thriftbooks.com .
Other processing grounds
From time to time we may also need to process personal information to comply with a legal obligation, if it is               necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried               out in the public interest.
Data retention
We keep the data we collect for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data was collected,           to perform our contractual and legal obligations, and for any applicable statute of limitations periods for the           purposes of bringing and defending claims.
Rights you have with regard to your data
You have certain rights with respect to your personal information, and we want to help you review and update your           information to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date. We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, such           as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, if it is not required by           law, or if the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in           the case in question. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may           include personal information, to verify your identity and the nature of your request. We will take reasonable steps           to respond to all requests within 30 days.
If you wish to exercise any of the following rights, you may do so by contacting us at support@thriftbooks.com :

You can request more information about the personal information we hold about you and request a copy of such               personal information.

Portability
You can ask for a copy of your personal information in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we               transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.
Withdrawal of Consent
If we are processing your personal information based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection               of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise               this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure               of certain of your personal information, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some               or all of our Service.
Objection
You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your personal information               for certain purposes, such as for marketing purposes.

Children's privacy
At ThriftBooks, we understand that children's privacy is important. The ThriftBooks site is not intended for use           by children under the age of 16. If you are under age 16, you should not submit personal identifying information           to ThriftBooks without the consent of your parent or guardian. If you are a parent and want to limit your children's           access to material you believe may be harmful to them, you may want to look into commercially available hardware,           software, and filtering devices. If you are interested in learning about these protections, information is available           at http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+filters and other similar sites.

California residents may request this list by emailing us at support@thriftbooks.com with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line.
Do Not Track Signals
We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent               industry standard for compliance.
Changes to the Policy
We may modify this Policy at any time. Any changes to the Policy will be effective from the time we publish the updated           Policy on our websites. By using the Services after the changes have been implemented, you accept the new privacy           Policy. If you do not consent to the terms of the updated Policy, you must stop using the Services.
