2. WHY FUNLAB COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION

(i) credit card details via credit card purchases on our payment platforms; and

2.4 'Sensitive Information' We will not ask a Customer for information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or details of health, disability or sexual activity or orientation, unless:
(a) the Customer provides their consent;
(b) the collection of that information is specifically authorised by law;
(c) the collection is necessary to lessen a serious or imminent threat to the health or safety of a person;

3. Use and Disclosure
 
3.2 Funlab will not use or disclose Personal Information about an individual for a different purpose (“the secondary purpose”) other than the primary purpose of collection unless:
(a) both of the following apply:
(i) the secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection and, if the personal information is sensitive information, directly related to the primary purpose of collection; and
(ii) the individual would reasonably expect Funlab to use or disclose the information for the secondary purpose- for example, we may disclose your Personal Information to an entity or individual in order to assist us to meet the primary purposes for which we collected your information;
(b) the individual has consented to the use or disclosure;
(c) it is unreasonable or impracticable for Funlab to obtain the individual’s consent and Funlab reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent:
(i) a serious threat to an individual’s life, health or safety; or
(ii) a serious threat to public health or public safety;
(d) Funlab has reason to suspect that unlawful activity or misconduct of a serious nature that relates to Funlab’s activities or functions has been, is being or may be engaged in, and we use or discloses the Personal Information as a necessary part of our investigation of the matter or in reporting our concerns to relevant persons or authorities;
(e) the use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law or a court or tribunal order;
(f) Funlab reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for one or more enforcement activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body;
(g) Funlab reasonably believes that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary to assist an APP entity, body or person to locate a person who has been reported missing;
(h) if the information has been collected from the Customer is not sensitive information and the use of the information is for the purpose of direct marketing:
(i) in each direct marketing communication with the Customer, Funlab draws to the Customer’s attention, or prominently displays a notice, as to how the Customer may make a request to not receive any further direct marketing communications;
(ii) each written direct marketing communication by Funlab with the individual (up to and including the communication that involves the use) sets out Funlab’s business address and telephone number and, if the communication with the individual is made by fax or other electronic means, a number or address at which Funlab can be directly contacted electronically; and
 
3.3 Data Quality
Funlab takes reasonable precautions to ensure that the personal information it collects, uses and discloses is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to- date. However, the accuracy of that information depends to a large extent on the information customer’s provide. That's why we recommend that customers:
(a) let us know if there are any errors in your personal information; and
 
3.4 Data Security
(a) Funlab will take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorised access or disclosure. This may include taking reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information once it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed.
(b) Funlab will not attempt to match de-identified or anonymous data collected through surveys or such online devices as "cookies", with information identifying an individual, without the consent of the relevant individual.
 
3.5 Accessing and Correcting Personal Information
(a) Funlab will permit records containing the Customer’s Personal Information to be accessed by a Customer when the Customer contacts us c/o the contact details at point 10 below. We may, however, refuse to provide the Customer with access to its Personal Information if, for instance, granting the Customer such access would pose a serious threat to the Customer’s life or to the health and safety of any individual or have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of any other individual.
(b) If the Customer believes that the Personal Information we hold about the Customer is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then the Customer may request us to amend it. We will consider if the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for amendment, then we will add a note to the Personal Information stating that the Customer disagrees with it.
(c) If the Customer:
(i) wishes to lodge a request to access and/or correct its Personal Information; or
(ii) has been refused access to its Personal Information by us for any reason described in this Policy and the Customer wishes to challenge that refusal; the Customer may do so by contacting our Privacy Officer as per the details in point 10 below. The procedure for challenging such a refusal is also set out in point 10 below.
(d) We will not normally charge a fee for processing an access request unless the request is complex or is resource intensive. We do, however, reserve the right to charge an administration fee if an individual requests access to their personal information more than once in a three month period.
