Disclosures and Privacy Policy
The Weary Chef is a labor of love, but it takes a tremendous amount of time and effort. I spend MANY hours each week researching and developing recipes, cooking, taking and editing photos, writing, marketing, and maintaining my site. In order to earn income for all that work, I sometimes accept compensation for sponsored posts, links, and advertisements to share here. I am quite choosy about what I will promote and only recommend products or brands that I would feel proud to recommend to friends. (We’re all friends here, right?) I try hard to make any sponsored posts just as genuine and valuable to my readers as any other content I write, and I hope you agree.
