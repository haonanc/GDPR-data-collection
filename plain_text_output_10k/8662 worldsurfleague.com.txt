Each WSL Entity may disclose Personal Data to other WSL Entities, which will use and disclose the information only for the purpose for which it was originally collected and as described herein. All WSL Entities abide by this Privacy Policy.
In some circumstances, WSL collects Personal Data about you from a third-party source (e.g. if WSL runs a competition or event in conjunction with a third-party co-promoter and you provide your Personal Data to it). As a general rule WSL will attempt to ensure any third parties from whom it obtains Personal Data about you comply with the privacy law requirements of your jurisdiction and have advised you that your Personal Data may or will be passed on to WSL and/or WSL affiliates or sponsors and that such third party has taken reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of the purposes for which WSL is collecting your Personal Data and that you have consented to the same, including its use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
WSL may engage third-party contractors to perform services which may involve the contractor handling your Personal Data.  In these situations, WSL restricts such third party to using any of your Personal Data for the purpose permitted under this Privacy Policy.
When you register on a WSL Digital Site, we collect Personal Data which we use in compliance with your notification preferences, which you may alter at any time. We use a third-party provider, MailChimp, to deliver our e-mail notifications. We gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies to help us monitor and improve our e-mails. For more information, please see  MailChimp’s privacy notice . You can unsubscribe from receiving e-mails by changing your preferences in the profile section or by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any of our emails.
In limited circumstances WSL may provide your Personal Data to third parties such as co-sponsors or promoters of WSL events for use as permitted in this Privacy Policy. WSL may also share information about your use of the WSL Digital Sites in anonymized, aggregate form with our trusted social media, advertising and analytic partners for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, for example, to improve and personalize your experience on the WSL Digital Sites or to perform analytics.
Third parties such as WSL’s advertisers, sponsors, service providers or social media platforms, including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube may receive or gather information about end users, including through the use of cookies, pixels, SDKs, web beacons or other tracking software and use that information for targeted advertising. WSL also uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads on WSL Digital Sites, which may, directly or indirectly, collect or use information about your visits to websites to display advertisements more tailored to your interests.
Please note that while the WSL is careful about choosing its sponsors, advertisers and partner third parties, it is only responsible for the content on the WSL Digital Sites and for the use of your Personal Data by any WSL Entity. All third parties associated with a WSL Digital Site with whom WSL may share Personal Data are bound by their own privacy and data collection and protection practices. WSL cannot be held liable for the policies or actions of such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policy of any click-thru site they visit through a WSL Digital Site.
