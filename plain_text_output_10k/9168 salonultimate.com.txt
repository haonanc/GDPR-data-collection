OpenSpend, Inc. Privacy Policy
OpenSpend, Inc. (“OpenSpend,” “we,” “us” or “our”) has created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy, and to communicate how we collect use, and disseminate information we obtain from you on www.salonultimate.com (the “Site”) and related sites and the services we offer (the “Service”). We receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Service, through a user account on the Service (your “Account”); (ii) your use of the Service; and (iii) from third party websites and services. When you use the Service, you are consenting to the collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to this Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site or Service or sending you an email; and we will post the most up-to-date version of this Privacy Policy at www.salonultimate/privacy-policy. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy after such changes have been first posted.
What This Privacy Policy Covers.
This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you are using or accessing the Site or Service. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.
Except as we explicitly stated at the time we request information, as provided for in this Privacy Policy, or as provided for in another agreement with OpenSpend, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
Collection and Use of Information.
On the Site you can do many things which may involve your Personal Information; for example, you can request information, schedule a demo, download information on the Service, order services, apply for a job, and register to become a partner. We will collect and use Personal Information from you to provide, personalize, improve and continue to operate the Service as well as for these purposes.
Registered users may have some personally identifiable information associated with their Account. Unregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Service (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.
Please also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Service, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available.
Individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Service.
When you create an Account and/or use certain aspects of the Service, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your name, company name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address, and, if applicable, financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, and credit card number. We may also ask for additional Personal Information, such as title, department name, fax number, or additional company information. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an Account on the Service and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous. You can update Personal Information at any time by contacting support@salonultimate.com or through your Account if you have one.
We use the Personal Information that we collect from you to set up and provide the Service for you and your organizations. We may also use the information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in us, the Service that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Your email addresses and any Personal Information may be shared with our partners involved in providing the Service, as well as in connection with providing value-added services and marketing and promotional opportunities, but will not be distributed or shared with unaffiliated third parties.
You can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving information from us, at any time by sending an email to support@openspend.com. Some features of the Service allow you to provide content to the Service, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the Service may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you deactivate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
If you communicate with us via e-mail or via some other form of communication, including interacting with us via the Site, we may retain such correspondence and the information contained therein and use such information to respond to your inquiry. We may also receive information about you from other sources, such as our agents, partners and service providers, and from publicly available sources. We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our “Agents”). We may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.
The financial and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used for marketing or promotional purposes. We use third-party intermediaries (“Payment Processors”) to manage billing and credit card processing related to invoices paid by credit card. The Payment Processors may be permitted to store, retain, or use the financial information provided, for the sole purpose of providing billing and credit card processing services to us and you.
Use and storage of financial and billing information is governed by the Payment Processor’s applicable terms of service and privacy policy. However, we may from time to time request and receive some of your financial information from our Payment Processor for the purposes of completing transactions you have initiated through the Service, enrolling you in discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, protecting against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business.
Some users may access the Site using their credentials from third party services via single sign-on. If you choose to log in to the Service using a third party single sign on provider, such third party will authenticate your identity and may share with us certain information associated with your profile on such third party’s account, some of which may include your Personal Information. As with all Third Party Services, your use of a single sign on provider shall be governed by the terms of service and privacy statement of such provider.
You may use the Site to host data and information (“Data”). We will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as described in this Privacy Policy, in your other agreements with us, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of an agreement with us, or as may be required by law.
We may also automatically collect, record and use certain information from your web browser when you interact with the Service and the Site, such as IP addresses, the number of visits, along with information on what pages are viewed and which links you have clicked on. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser. IP address information is not made public; we do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information about you and provide such information to partners, service providers and other third parties with whom we conduct business. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Service and their websites or services, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Service interfaces with them. In addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.
