The amount and type of information we gather depends upon your use of the Website and, in                         some cases, what type of information you choose to disclose. We may collect the following                         information from you:
Personal Information
We collect information from you when you submit your personal information to us over the                         Website, such as by providing a review of the Website. Such personal information may include                         your name, email addresses, phone number, and other information which you voluntarily                         provide to us.
Information You Make Public
The Website may contain features that allow you to upload, post, transmit, display, perform or                         distribute content, including personal information about yourself. For example, you may choose                         to include personal information within your public-facing review, which is available and                         accessible to all visitors of the website. Any information that you choose to disclose by means                         of such features becomes public information over which VehicleHistory.com is unable to                         exercise control. You should take caution when deciding to disclose personal information by                         means of such features.
Device/Internet Connection Information
When you use the Website, we automatically gather information made available by your web                         browser (such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome), Internet service provider (such as                         Comcast or Time Warner), and device (such as your computer, phone, or tablet), depending on                         your settings for each. For example, we may collect your IP address, information about the                         operating system or type of device you use, the date and time you access the Website, your log                         in attempts, and the location of your device.
Information Provided by Third Parties
VehicleHistory.com may receive information about you and your Internet activities if you have                         provided it to a Third Party and we subsequently acquire the information from the Third Party.                         Such information may include, but is not limited to, your personal and online interests and                         Internet browsing habits. These Third Parties may have collected such information by placing                         Cookies on your device, using web beacons, gathering IP addresses and log data, and so forth.                         The purpose of this practice, which is sometimes called "retargeting," is to deliver content and                         advertising that is specific to your interests. For example, if you look at a particular product                         or                         service on the Website, you may later see that same product advertised to you on Facebook.                         You can better learn about such Third-Party data collection and advertising practices, including                         how to opt-out of retargeting, at the following websites:
Other Information
From time to time, we may obtain other information from you, such as when you make a claim                         for a prize pursuant to a contest or other promotion run on the Website, or when you request                         assistance through from our customer service department. You will always be asked to provide                         such other information voluntarily, and we will not collect it without your permission.
3. How does VehicleHistory.com use Cookies?
“Cookies” are files that are placed on your device by websites you visit. The purpose of a                         Cookie is to identify you as a unique user of the Website. A web beacon is programming code                         that can be used to, among other things, transfer an individual’s unique user identification                         (often                         in the form of a Cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired                         information about an individual in a database. This allows us to track certain websites you                         visit                         online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services you may be interested in, and                         to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.
We currently use Cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related                         information about you with information we already have in our database, for the following                         purposes:
To Analyze User Trends. We also use Cookies for analytics and                             performance—that is,                             to gather information that helps us understand how you and other users engage with the                             Website and our Third-Party partners and figure out how to do it better. The Third Party                             analytics vendors we work with include Google Analytics and Mouseflow.
To Provide Support to You. We also use Cookies, including those placed by Third Parties, to provide customer support                             services.
To Provide Vehicle Information to You. We also use Cookies,                             including                             those placed                             by Third Parties, to provide vehicle information to you. For example, we may use a                             session ID cookie, which is only kept for the duration of your visit to the Website, to keep                             track of the vehicle information (including VIN numbers) that you have entered so that                             you do not have to re-enter it.
To Advertise to You. We also use Cookies and web beacons,                             including                             those placed by                             Third Parties, to deliver advertising that may be of interest to you. For example, Bing,                             Google Tag Manager, Google AdWords, Jumpstart Automotive Media, and other Third                             Party Cookies may also be used in our advertising endeavors. Cookies and web beacons also help us and our Third-Party advertising partners ensure you do not see the                             same advertisements over and over and to identify block unwanted ads.
You may opt out of Third Party Cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out                         page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .                         You can also learn more                         about how to delete or control Cookies at http://www.aboutcookies.org/.

21.1.2. You acknowledge that without this                                             provision, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial or                                             to participate in a class action.
21.1.3. The language in this Agreement shall                                             be                                             interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly                                             for or against either party.
21.1.4.The arbitration shall be commenced and                                             conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the                                             American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement,                                             available at the AAA website                                             www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.

If, however, the arbitrator finds that either                                             the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought                                             for                                             an improper purpose (as                                             measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure                                             11(b)), then you will pay the                                             arbitrator fees, in addition to any amount that exceeds the filing fees.                                             In                                             that case, you also agree to                                             reimburse VehicleHistory.com for all payments disbursed that are your                                             obligation to reimburse under the AAA Rules. The                                             arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for                                             the                                             arbitrator to resolve, except that                                             issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration provision are                                             for a                                             Court of Competent Jurisdiction                                             to resolve. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through document                                             submission, through                                             telephone, or online. The arbitrator will issue a decision in writing,                                             but need only provide a statement of                                             reasons if requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable                                             law,                                             and any award may be                                             challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. VehicleHistory.com may                                             litigate                                             to compel arbitration in court, to stay                                             proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter                                             judgment on the award entered                                             by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall award costs to the prevailing                                             party                                             (including, without limitation,                                             fees, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees) at any time during the                                             proceeding and upon request from                                             either party, within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

24. NMVTIS Consumer Access Disclaimer REVISED: April                                 2015
The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) is an electronic system                                 that contains information on                                 certain automobiles titled in the United States. NMVTIS is intended to serve as a                                 reliable source of title and brand history for automobiles, but it does not contain detailed information regarding a                                 vehicle’s repair history.
All states, insurance companies, and junk and salvage yards are required by federal                                 law                                 to regularly report                                 information to NMVTIS. However, NMVTIS does not contain information on all motor                                 vehicles in the United States                                 because some states are not yet providing their                                 vehicle                                 data to the system. Currently, the data provided to NMVTIS                                 by states is provided in a variety of time frames; while some states report and                                 update                                 NMVTIS data in “real-time”                                 (as title transactions occur), other states send updates less frequently, such as                                 once                                 every 24 hours or within a                                 period of days.
Information on previous, significant vehicle damage may not be included in the                                 system if                                 the vehicle was never                                 determined by an insurance company (or other appropriate entity) to be a “total                                 loss” or                                 branded by a state titling                                 agency. Conversely, an insurance carrier may be required to report a “total loss” even                                 if the vehicle’s titling-state                                 has not determined the vehicle to be “salvage” or “junk.”
A vehicle history report is NOT a substitute for an independent vehicle inspection.                                 Before making a decision to                                 purchase a vehicle, consumers are strongly encouraged to also obtain an independent                                 vehicle inspection to ensure                                 the vehicle does not have hidden damage. The Approved NMVTIS Data Providers (look for the                                 NMVTIS logo) can                                 include vehicle condition data from sources other than NMVTIS.
NMVTIS data INCLUDES (as available by those entities required to report to the                                 System):
Information from participating state                                 motor vehicle titling agencies.
• Information on automobiles, buses, trucks, motorcycles, recreational                                 vehicles,                                 motor homes, and tractors. NMVTIS                                 may not currently include commercial vehicles if those vehicles are not included in                                 a                                 state’s primary database for                                 title records (in some states, those vehicles are managed by a separate state                                 agency),                                 although these records may                                 be added at a later time.
• Information on “brands” applied to vehicles provided by participating state                                 motor                                 vehicle titling agencies. Brand                                 types and definitions vary by state, but may provide useful information about the                                 condition or prior use of the                                 vehicle.
• Most recent odometer reading in the state’s title record.
• Information from insurance companies, and auto recyclers, including junk and                                 salvage yards, that is required by                                 law to be reported to the system, beginning March 31, 2009. This information will                                 include if the vehicle was                                 determined to be a “total loss” by an insurance carrier.
• Information from junk and salvage yards receiving a “cash for clunker”                                 vehicle                                 traded-in under the Consumer                                 Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 (CARS) Program.
Consumers are advised to visit www.vehiclehistory.gov for details on how to interpret the information in the                                 system and understand the meaning of various labels applied to vehicles by the                                 participating state motor vehicle                                 titling agencies.
