Effective August 2017
The Pinkberry Franchise System
The Pinkberry franchise system is a restaurant network made up of company-operated, franchised, and licensed Pinkberry restaurant businesses. Pinkberry franchisees (“Franchised Operators” or “Operators”) own and operate their own individual franchised businesses. Pinkberry licensees (“Licensees”) are granted a license to use Pinkberry’s trade name and marks in the sale of Pinkberry products at Pinkberry licensed locations. Franchised Operators and Licensees are independent third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of any Franchised Operator or Licensee, or to any Pinkberry operations outside of the United States. Please see the Franchised Operator and Licensee Online Services section below for more information regarding a Franchised Operator’s or Licensee’s applicable policies.
