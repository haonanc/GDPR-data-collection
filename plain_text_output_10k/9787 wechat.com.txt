YOUR RIGHTS
The following section applies only to persons that are resident in the European Union.
You have certain rights in relation to the Personal Information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below.
We set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, such as where the request involves substantial volumes of information or is otherwise complex). To exercise any of your rights, please complete the request form and follow the steps for submission.
Access & Correction
Upon request WeChat will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You also have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You also have the right to correct that information.
You can access and correct your personal information by logging into your WeChat account at any time. For example, you can delete certain Location Data that you have provided us via your device settings or the "Clear Location" option within WeChat.
If you believe we hold any other personal information, or you want to correct information that you are unable to correct using your account, please complete the request form here . We may not be able to provide you with certain Personal Information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the Personal Information we hold about you would reveal information about another person).
With respect to correction requests, where we agree that the Personal Information is inaccurate or incomplete, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can rectify the Personal Information too.
Erasure
You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your WeChat account and following the account deletion instructions here . If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please complete the request form here .
You may request that we erase the Personal Information we hold about you in the following circumstances:
you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to have your Personal Information;
we obtained your consent to process the Personal Information and you withdraw that consent (and we have no other grounds for processing the Personal Information);
you believe we are unlawfully processing your Personal Information; or
you are or were under the age of 13 when we collected the Personal Information and we can verify your age.
Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing your Personal Information (as described below) whilst we consider a request to erase your data.
Please note, however, that we may retain the Personal Information if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims, freedom of expression or some other legal obligation) but we will let you know if that is the case.
Where you have requested that we erase your Personal Information that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the Personal Information or providing links to the Personal Information to erase it too.
Restriction of Processing to Storage Only
You have a right to require us to stop processing the Personal Information we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the Personal Information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection).
Where we agree to stop processing the Personal Information, we will try to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant Personal Information so that they can stop processing it too.
You may request we stop processing and just store the Personal Information we hold about you where:
you believe the Personal Information is not accurate (for the period it takes for us to verify whether it is accurate);
we wish to erase the Personal Information as the processing we are doing is unlawful (but you want us to retain the Personal Information and just store it instead); or
we wish to erase the Personal Information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes (but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims).
