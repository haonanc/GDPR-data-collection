Traeger Grills App and WiFire Products
Traeger Grills (“Traeger Grills”) respects the privacy of its customers.  This Policy describes our data practices which are specific to any Traeger Wifire™ enabled grill (a “Traeger Wifire Grill”) as well as the Traeger Wood Fired Grills App (the “App” and, together with the Traeger Wifire Grill, the “Traeger Wifire Products”).  This Policy does not apply to our website generally or to any Traeger product or software application other than the Traeger Wifire Products.
Traeger Wifire Products offer additional performance capabilities which include allowing you to control many features on your Traeger Wifire Grill from a single mobile phone or other supported device paired to your grill.  This Policy explains the circumstances under which Traeger Grills collects, uses and discloses information through your use of the Traeger Wifire Products.  By using Traeger Wifire Products you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy.
You can use a Traeger Wifire Grill without connecting it to the Internet.  In that case, a Traeger Wifire Grill does not send any information to Traeger Grills or its service providers, though we may obtain information directly from your Traeger Wifire Grill if you return it to us or our dealers, including to provide warranty and other services.  However, if you choose to connect your Traeger Wifire Grill to the App or to the Internet then Traeger Grills and its service providers will have access to information collected by your Traeger Wifire Grill, and that information may be linked to information collected through the App and to information that we and our service providers and third parties collect about you from other sources, including through our other products or apps or our website.
Any collected information is controlled by Traeger Pellet Grills, LLC, which is headquartered in the United States.  Our principal office is located at 1215 Wilmington Ave, Suite 200, Salt Lake City, UT 84106.
Personal Information and Other Information We Collect
Traeger Grills collects both “Personal Information” and “Other Information” about its customers.  Traeger Grills defines “Personal Information” as information that it can directly associate with a specific person without additional information.  Examples of Personal Information include a name or an email address. Traeger Grills defines “Other Information” as information that it cannot directly associate with a specific person without the aid of additional information.
We may combine Other Information and Personal Information and when we do we treat all of the combined information as Personal Information.  We combine the Personal Information and the Other Information that we collect through Traeger Wifire Products with information received from other sources, both online and offline.  For example, we may combine information collected from the Traeger Wifire Products with information we collect through your use of our website and other apps, in connection with Traeger sponsored events, or from your phone or email communications with us.
Technical and Usage Data
We may collect a range of technical, usage and diagnostic information from your use of the Traeger Wifire Grill.  For example, we track how you use and control your Traeger Wifire Grill during each session and over time (such as temperature, cooking mode, use of the temperature probe and use of other features and accessories) and also collect and analyze technical and diagnostic metrics related to the grill’s use (such as the status and condition of moving and other grill components and the alignment of actual and target grill temperature).
If you use your Traeger Wifire Grill without the App and without connecting it to the Internet, the grill will not send any information to Traeger Grills or its service providers.  However, if you return your Traeger Wifire Grill to Traeger Grills or a dealer, we may collect the information stored on it, including for analytics purposes, to evaluate and better understand your warranty claim and to improve our products, and that information may be linked to other information about you, including Personal Information.  If you use your Traeger Wifire Grill with the App or connect your Traeger Wifire Grill to the Internet, Traeger Grills and its service providers will have access to technical and usage information that is collected by the Traeger Wifire Grill, and that information may be linked to additional information, including Personal Information, collected through the App and other sources.
Personal Information
Although it is not required in order to use the App, you must set up a user account in order to use the Traeger Wifire Grill control features of the App. As part of that process, you will be asked to provide certain Personal Information, including your name and your email address.  This information may be linked to technical and usage data described above and the other information discussed below, including location data.
Location Data
The Traeger Wifire Products also may use your IP address to approximate your general geographic location.  We use this information for a variety of purposes, including for marketing, analytics and to improve our products.  We also may use your location to target you for special events or promotional offers, including events sponsored by Traeger Grills or recipes.
Log Data
When you use the App, we or our service providers may automatically receive and record certain information from your mobile phone, tablet or other device.  This may include data such as the features you use on the App; software and hardware attributes (including device identifiers); IP address; date and time of use; and certain other tracking information.  To do this, we may use web logs or applications that recognize your device and gather information about its online activity.
Cookies, SDKs, and other online tracking mechanisms
We use mechanisms to track and analyze how you use the App. We also may engage third parties who will do so on our behalf (see below in the section entitled “How We Share Information With Third Parties”).  These mechanisms can be used, for example, to collect information about your use of the App during a current session and over time; your device’s operating system and software attributes; your Internet service provider; and your IP address.  Such mechanisms may include cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts or other tracking mechanisms.  Some of these mechanisms, such as cookies, involve storing small files on your computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device.  Other mechanisms may involve transmission of information to a third-party server through other means.  For example, we may allow third parties to use an application software development kit (SDK) or server-to-server connection to collect this type of information.  An SDK is a piece of software code that we embed in our App to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the App, and a server-to-server connection enables us to exchange data with third parties when an SDK integration is not feasible or practical.
The App currently does not have a “do not track” feature.

Analytics providers
We may work with certain third parties to collect Personal Information and/or Other Information and to engage in analysis, auditing, research and reporting of such information.  These third parties may use web logs, pixels, tags, SDKs, or other tracking mechanisms or set and access cookies on your computer, mobile phone, tablet, or other device to collect information from the App and the Traeger Wifire Grill, as well as the devices on which you run the App and the device through which your Traeger Wifire Grill is connected to the Internet.  We may also use service providers that enable us to better collect and control data from the App and your Traeger Wifire Grill and direct it to third-party analytics providers.  The use of online tracking mechanisms by these third parties is subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy.
Sharing for legal and other purposes

• To respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

Security
Traeger Grills takes steps believed by it to be commercially reasonable to protect user personal data against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion.  However, no security program is foolproof, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personal Information or your Other Information.
