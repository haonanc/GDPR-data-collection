Privacy Policy - Social Blade
The Easy To Read Version
Please read the full terms below, but in order to simplify things here are a couple of bullet points to understand our privacy policy and how we handle data
- We automate things, but at the end of the day, pretty much all data you see on Social Blade is akin to going to your public profile on a social media site and writing down your follower count/etc. We don't store, show or share private information unless explicitly stated and requested and permission is granted. Furthermore, we feel our job is a bit like a journalist. We want to be a trusted source of information and that means not accepting requests to remove or change information we have listed unless there is something inaccurate with it. The world comes to us to see transparent follower/etc numbers to see if there is any "fishy business" going on. If we remove this data when requested it ruins our credibility. As the data we are displaying is public data anyone could have gotten from visiting your profile anyway we don't feel like this should raise any privacy concerns.
- Just like the rest of the Internet we use cookies. Cookies aren't evil, they're the way you can log into a website once and stay logged in until you log out instead of typing your login/password on every page.
- We provide our services for the most part free of charge. Servers cost money though as well as the team to program them. For this reason we monetize the site via ads. If you don't like them we do offer a paid subscription to remove them.
- Social Blade is a respected site that brands and companies use on a daily basis so we do have services for them to help them find users who they may be interested in working with. We may in the future develop a way on site to allow them to communicate with you directly if you are interested (i.e. opt in to brand deal/etc communication), but for now we simply provide them a list of names and statistics. Even if we have your email address or personal information we never share this, only public information.
- You come to Social Blade for analytics. Analytics also helps us know how many people are using the site, which parts of the site you use the most often, etc. It helps us build out things you're interested in and not focus on things you're not. Google Analytics and other analytics tools we may use from time to time also aren't evil. Without things like this we wouldn't know how to help you!
- Lastly just a word about passwords. If you create an account on Social Blade you need to create a password. This password encrypted in our database in a way that no one can see what it is, not even us. That said we recommend you don't use the same password you use on other sites. Also, if you authenticate your account from a third party with us we never store nor even have access to your password on third party services.
- We hope this more informal, yet also more informative privacy policy helped. Again see below the more "legal" version but there shouldn't be anything surprising there if you read this section.
