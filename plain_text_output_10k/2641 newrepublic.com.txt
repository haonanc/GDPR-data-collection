This Privacy Policy was last updated effective May 24, 2018
To help you understand how information submitted will be treated when you log on to and use our website, The New Republic Online ("NewRepublic.com") offers this Privacy Policy. Use of the NewRepublic.com website, and disclosure to us of your personal information, is optional and voluntary. By visiting NewRepublic.com , you are accepting and agreeing to the practices described in this Policy. The following paragraphs describe the type of information NewRepublic.com collects, the reasons why such information is collected, how such information is used and who has access to it.
Collection of Information
NewRepublic.com collects information that is provided voluntarily by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, street address, city, state, zip code and email address, is gathered at certain interactive areas on the site, such as when you subscribe to our print or digital publication while online.
Wherever possible and practical, NewRepublic.com gives users options about submitting information. Such choices include:
Opting not to receive our electronic newsletters, either by refraining from signing up to receive them, or by unsubscribing in the footer of the emails themselves.
Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need for collecting information from our users.
Subscriptions
You may use the website to subscribe to the print or digital version of The New Republic by following the instructions for subscribing. All subscription-related information is collected from users on this site and stored by the magazine's fulfillment house, CDS Global, and the magazine's email service provider, MailChimp.
You may use the website to sign up for a temporary free pass to the digital edition of The New Republic magazine by submitting your email address and responding to the confirmation email. This data, which includes the time and location of your opting in, is stored by the magazine's email service provider, MailChimp. By signing up for a free pass with your email, you are opting in to receive future correspondence from The New Republic.
Electronic Newsletters
NewRepublic.com offers several electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe and unsubscribe at any time. You will have the option to subscribe to editorial newsletters only, magazine subscription offers and discounts, and/or information about events or staff updates from The New Republic. By subscribing to The New Republic's email lists, you will be sharing certain identifying information about your opt-in location, such as zip code and country, along with your name and email address.
General Principles
NewRepublic.com's Privacy Policy may change from time to time without notice to you. You should read this Privacy Policy each time you plan to submit personally identifiable information so that you understand how the information you are submitting will be used.
Any changes made to the Privacy Policy will be prospective, not retroactive.
NewRepublic.com is not responsible for the information practices of third parties, although we take care to engage third-party fulfillment processors, ad servers, CDNs, survey companies and other support services that respect your privacy, preferences and data security needs.
Collection of Information
NewRepublic.com collects information that is provided voluntarily by visitors to our site. Certain identifying information, such as name, zip code and email address is gathered as NewRepublic.com uses MailChimp, a reputable third party, to deliver the email newsletters you will receive from our site and serve all of the advertisements that are placed within those emails.
MailChimp collects and stores all the information users submit to NewRepublic.com in connection with the electronic newsletters. If you would like to know more about the information-gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of MailChimp, please see http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/
You may remove yourself from any or all of the electronic newsletters' mailing lists at any time by following instructions for unsubscribing found at the end of every newsletter or by emailing support@tnr.com .
Surveys
From time to time NewRepublic.com conducts voluntary user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers for various purposes including promotions, contests and offers. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party, unless so indicated in this Privacy Policy.
Cookies and IP Addresses
In order to offer and provide personalized custom services, NewRepublic.com uses cookies to limit the number of times a particular advertisement is shown to a user as the user navigates through the site. A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file may contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the website. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk, read cookie files created by other sites, or damage your files.
You are able to delete, disable, or accept cookies from NewRepublic.com at any time. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies easily by disabling them on your browser. You must have cookies turned on to use premium areas of NewRepublic.com. To learn how to configure your cookies settings on your browser, visit: http://www.aboutcookies.org.uk/managing-cookies
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. NewRepublic.com may use data contained in log files to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
We also use third party advertisements on NewRepublic.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).
Use of the Information Collected NewRepublic.com uses information you voluntarily submit to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through our website and to communicate with users with legal notices, notices of material changes to terms and conditions, privacy policy, rules, etc., and account status. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular basis—daily and potentially weekly—and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing.
The staff of NewRepublic.com maintain accounts on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and may use email addresses voluntarily submitted by newsletter or magazine subscribers to better target boosted posts and advertisements. We may also use aggregated demographic data collected by these social platforms to target similar audiences on Google AdWords.
With respect to advertisements, an advertiser will inform us which type of audience it seeks to reach, and NewRepublic.com, through MailChimp, will place the advertisement in the body of the email newsletter of those individuals fitting the advertiser's criteria. Pop-up advertisements may be displayed to a targeted audience based on the same criteria. The advertisers are not able to access your account or any of your personally identifiable information.
We also use tracking services, such as Google Analytics, to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas.
NewRepublic.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests. Because NewRepublic.com does not track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a particular ad.
Credit Card Information
We comply with generally accepted industry standards in collecting and processing credit card information. However, NewRepublic.com does not guarantee the safety of credit card information over the internet.
Information Sharing
When you visit NewRepublic.com and are asked to provide information about yourself, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Privacy Policy, you are sharing that information only with NewRepublic.com. NewRepublic.com will not disclose the information you submit, except with our third party fulfillment vendors and except as otherwise described here, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires disclosure to protect the rights or property of NewRepublic.com, or for administrative or other purposes we deem necessary to maintain or service our products and services. For example, we may allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide you with our services.
If you do not want your data to be shared, you may choose not to permit the data to be collected or transferred by not submitting personally identifiable information on our site, or by not using a particular service.
NewRepublic.com Security Measures
The NewRepublic.com website has technical and organizational security measures in place, including firewalls, to protect the information under our control from accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access. Such measures do not guarantee prevention of loss, misuse, or alteration of information, however, so while we strive to protect your information, NewRepublic.com cannot warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
Children's Privacy
NewRepublic.com site is intended for use by individuals over the age of 18. We will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and not knowingly provide children under the age of 13 with access to NewRepublic.com. If you are under 13, please do not submit any personally identifiable information on our site. Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission to send any personal information online to anyone.
Other Information About Your Privacy
Whenever you voluntarily disclose any information online in any forum, that information can be collected and used by others. In other words, if you post personal information online that may be accessed by the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. It is important to be responsible and careful whenever you are online.
Updating, Correcting and Deleting Personal Information
Users who subscribe to our print or digital publication, The New Republic, may correct or change online their subscription information. Users may change this information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with updating information, or who have any questions about how our services work, may contact us at newrepublic@cdsfulfillment.com .
If you do not want your personally identifiable information to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by letting us know by emailing, calling, or writing us (see addresses below). Similarly, please contact us at the same addresses if at any time you wish to review your personally identifiable information.
Currently, NewRepublic.com does not offer users a means by which to completely delete personal information submitted while on this site.
