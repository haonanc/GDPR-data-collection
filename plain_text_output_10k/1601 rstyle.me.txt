* BM – Chantilly Lace
* SW – Super White
Hi!
I have been researching different white paint to use as trim in my kitchen. I pretty much had it narrowed down to BM Chantilly a Lace or SW Suoer White. My kitchen walls are a very light gray color and these two whites looked very clean (w/o any hues of other colors showing). I began thinking that a high gloss might be nice instead and came across your page. Would you recommend either of the paints discussed for your mirror to be used on mounding and kitchen cabinets? Thank you for your time! Have a great week!
Hi Shannon –
Both colors are very nice and white, but what is more important is how they look in the room. I could use the same paint in my house and the paint color could look different. It all depends on the light in the room. You could get a sample pot of each and see how they look in the room during all hours of the day, choose the one that looks clear and bright. Using high gloss always looks nice, but realize that when you have such a high gloss finish you don’t want any brush strokes to show since every imperfection will show up when using high gloss. I would use a high quality paint brush to get the smoothest finish possible. You could also use a product called Floetrol that you add to the paint to help lessen the look of brush marks.
