1. Information We Collect
Information You Give Us.
When you interact with our Platform, you may choose to provide information that could reasonably be used to contact you, or to identify you personally, or that otherwise relates to your person (“Personal Information”), such as:
Your contact information (e.g., name, e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number);
User name, display name, and password;
Geolocation information, such as your city, state or zip code;
Demographic information, such as age information and gender;
Payment information, such as credit card number and expiration date;
Communications preferences;
Comments, photos, and other user-generated content posted in our interactive online features;
Correspondence and other information that you send to us; and
Additional information as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or pursuant to your consent.
Information We Automatically Collect or Receive When You Use Our Platform.
Whenever you interact with our Platform, we, as well as any of our third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include, among other things:
Your browser type and operating system;
Sites you visited before and after visiting the Platform;
Pages you view and links you click on within the Platform;
Information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies; and
Information about your interactions with e-mail messages, such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded.
Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.
Device Identifiers
In the course of collecting Usage Information, we may also automatically collect your IP address, or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, Wi-Fi card, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Platform.
A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. When you visit the Platform, we may view your Device Identifier. We use this information to determine the physical location of your Device, including longitude and latitude information. We may also use this information to enhance the Platform and we may associate your Device Identifier with your Personal Information.
Cookies and Similar Technologies. 
We may use cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”), and similar technologies to automatically collect this information.  Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser.  Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as "web beacons" or "clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.  Local Shared Objects or Flash Cookies are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player. 
We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, Local Shared Objects, and similar technologies to collect information through the Platform.  For example, our third-party service providers may use these technologies to collect information that helps us with traffic measurement, research, and analytics. 
By using the Platform, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.  You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser.  However, if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or features on the Platform.  Please note that you may need to take additional steps beyond changing your browser settings to refuse or disable Local Shared Objects and similar technologies.  Local Shared Objects can be controlled through the instructions on Adobe’s Setting Manager page .  If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete these technologies, some of the functionality of the Platform may no longer be available to you.
You can also learn more about cookies by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org, which includes additional, useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browsers. For more information on advertising using cookies and how to opt-out of advertising cookies specifically, please see Your Choices below.
Information From Other Sources. 
We may receive additional information about you from other sources and may combine that information with the other information we collect or receive about you.  For example:
We may receive information about you from our member organizations and other members of the U.S. Olympic  family, including but not limited to our U.S. Olympic Training Sites,  Community Olympic Development Program partners, and U.S. Paralympic Sports Clubs;
We may receive information from you off-line, such as when you visit USOC facilities or participate in USOC-sponsored events;
We may receive information about you from our “affiliates,” which are entities that are legally part of the same group of companies that USOC is part of, or that become part of that group;
If you are on another website and you opt-in to receive information from USOC, that website will forward to us your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested;
You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third party website) through which you allow us to collect and share (or the third party to collect and share) information about you, including Personal Information; and
We may receive information from third-party partners and service providers, including partners and service providers that provide us information that is publicly or commercially available.
We may match the information we collect about you through the Platforms with information collected from such third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and/or to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.
2. How We Use the Information We Collect or Receive

3. How We Share the Information We Collect and Receive
We are committed to maintaining your trust, and we want you to understand how we may share the information we collect.
Member Organizations and Affiliates.  We may share your information with our member organizations and other affiliated entities for a variety of purposes, including business, operational, and marketing purposes.
Service Providers.  We may share your information with third party service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as to host the Platform manage databases, host a store or other e-commerce platform, perform analyses, or send communications for us.
Select Business Partners.  We may share your information with select business partners so that they can provide you with special offers, promotional materials, and other materials that may be of interest to you. However, the USOC is not responsible for the privacy practices of these business partners, which may use your information for their own purposes.
Some unaffiliated third parties have agreed in writing to use your personal information only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. These unaffiliated third parties may use your personal information to send you information, advertising and promotional materials about their companies via mail, unless you opt out of receiving such third party materials.  For further information about opting out, see the section below on “ Your Choices .”
Other Parties When Required By Law or as Necessary to Protect the Platform.  We may disclose your information to third parties in order to protect the legal rights, safety, and security of the USOC, our member organizations and the users of our Platform; enforce our Terms of Use; prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes); and comply with or respond to law enforcement or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government or other entity, whether or not legally required.
In Connection With a Reorganization or Transfer of Assets. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.
Other Parties With Your Consent. We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing, including when you post information to a user profile or a public area of the Platform, such as a chat room, forum, blog, or other community tool.
Aggregate Information.  We may disclose to third parties information that does not describe or identify individual users, such as aggregate website usage data or demographic reports.
4. Your Choices
You have a number of choices about how we handle information we collect or receive about you.
Your Choice Not to Share Your Information or Receive Promotional Messages. You may always direct us not to share your Personal Information with third parties (other than our service providers), not to use your Personal Information to provide you with information or offers, and not to send you newsletters, emails or other communications by: (i) modifying your registered user information on the Platform; (ii) sending us an email at digitalmedia@usoc.org; (iii) contacting us by mail at United States Olympic Committee, 1 Olympic Plaza, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80909, Attn: TeamUSA.org; or (iv) following the removal instructions in the communication that you receive.
Your Choice to Correct/Delete/Modify Your Information. If you wish to modify, verify, correct, or delete any of your Personal Information collected through the Platform, you may edit your registered user information or contact us at the above address or email. In accordance with our routine record keeping, we may delete certain records that contain Personal Information you have submitted through the Platforms. We are under no obligation to store such Personal Information indefinitely and disclaim any liability arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons.
Your Choice  Not to Receive Targeted Ads. If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by visiting the NAI Opt-out page . Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt-out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides a mechanism to opt out of receiving cookies from those companies. Please note that if you opt-out of targeted advertising, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes.
“Do Not Track” Signals. Please note that while you may have the opportunity to opt-out of targeted advertising and you may be able to control the use of cookies through your web browser as described above, some web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the USOC currently does not take action in response to these signals.  If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. For more information about “do not track,” visit www.allaboutdnt.org .
5. Data Security
We have adopted security procedures to help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the information we collect and receive.  Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to our Platform and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of information.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of the Platform using your password, whether or not authorized by you.  Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
6. Children’s Privacy
Our Platform is directed to a general audience.  Our Platform does not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from children under the age of 13.  If you are under 13 years of age, please do not submit any personal information through our Platform without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.  
7. Links to Third Party Sites and Services
The Platform may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated by third parties and that are not under the direct control of the USOC.  Such links do not constitute an endorsement by the USOC of those other websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to this third-party content.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites or services.
8. Users Outside the U.S.
The USOC is based in the United States, and, regardless of where you use our Platform or otherwise provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the U.S.  Please note that any information we obtain about you will be stored in accordance with U.S. privacy laws, regulations, and standards, which may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence.  By using our Platform, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S.
