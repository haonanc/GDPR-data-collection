1. The Information We Collect.

(a) Anonymous Information: is data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. Anonymous Information is aggregate data that websites use to administer their sites. This Anonymous Information comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, and may include such information as your browser type or your Internet Protocol (IP) address (if not deleted, clipped or anonymized). HealthStream may from time to time retain third parties to help us collect and aggregate Site information.
(b) Personally Identifiable Information: is any information that personally identifies you, such as your name, the organization you represent, email address, or your telephone number. Similarly, to the extent that anonymous information is combined with Personally Identifiable Information, we treat the combined information as Personally Identifiable Information. For example, you may be asked to provide the following information:
