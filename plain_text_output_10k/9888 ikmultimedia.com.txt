The PRIVACY POLICY applied by IK Multimedia US, LLC regarding handling of users' personal data  as well as  the information notice about interaction with its web services, is described below.  This notice does not apply to other Web sites accessed through site links.
1) GENERAL PURPOSE FOR WHICH DATA ARE USED
All personal data acquired and/or requested, either prior to or during the course of contractual relationship, will be used to fulfill your requirements, ensuring that the contractual obligations are met and administrative and  legal obligations are provided correctly by the company IK Multimedia US, LLC, thereby allowing the business activities associated to its objectives to be conducted as efficiently as possible.  The supply of data is not mandatory but is necessary in order to set up and execute this agreement; refusal to provide such data may therefore prevent the company from establishing a working relationship with you. Furthermore, your non-sensitive personal data provided with your express consent, revocable at any time, has been obtained, for the following additional uses:
a) inclusion in IK Multimedia US, LLC's data bases for the purpose of sending business notices/information relating to commercial activities conducted by IK Multimedia US, LLC;
b) use for statistical purposes in connection with promotional campaigns;
c) circulating of personal data, including in the form of images and/or videos within the company’s official web site.
2) PROCESSING METHODS
Data will be processed using appropriate methods and tools that guarantee their confidentiality and may be processed using electronic or automated means (network data processing systems not accessible to the public) and using non-automated means (paper-based archives and records), both protected by appropriate security measures such as personalised passwords offering exclusive access, personal identity codes and limited access to records.
Certain types of data that are considered sensitive by the law (such as data capable of revealing racial and ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or other convictions, political opinion, membership of political parties, trade unions, associations or organisations of a religious, philosophical, political or trade union nature, as well as personal data capable of revealing state of health or sexual activities), which we could be made aware, after being informed by yourself or after having processed documents furnished by you, at the start up or during the course of a working relationship with our Company, may only be used with your prior written consent.
3) TRANSFER OF DATA
Personal data supplied may not be transferred by our Company, except a) only in the circumstances outlined by law, for the purpose of supplying the service requested and/or executing the agreement, in order to fulfill administrative, accounting and/or fiscal obligations referred to under point 1). In such circumstances, your express consent is not required, but failure to provide it will prevent the Company from setting up a working relationship or responding to your request; b) solely to outside associates of the company IK Multimedia US, LLC, acting as tax and/or accountancy consultants, for the performance of the tasks described under point 1). Again, in these circumstances, your express consent is not required, but failure to provide it will prevent the Company from setting up a working relationship or responding to your request; c) to subsidiary companies and/or companies in which shares are held, sales networks (agents, dealers, collaborators and/or distributors), customer service and support agents, sub-suppliers and sub-contractors involved in conducting agreement / contractual or business relations.

The data will be transferred for the purposes described in the present policy (for example, to provide the services requested by you, to share your data with other supplier companies or simply because the servers on which your data is stored is located in a third country). The existing legislation on privacy and protection of personal data in these countries might not be equivalent to that of your country of residence.
IK Multimedia US, LLC will adopt measures to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with the present policy, independently of the country in which it might be transferred. These measures include the use of contractual clauses that are standard for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (i.e. specific mandatory contractual obligations which must be signed by the supplier) and/or, if applicable, the certification that the entity receiving the data, has subscribed to the U.S.A. Safe Harbor program, or other legitimate criteria provided by law, such Binding Corporate Rules, if deemed appropriate in future.

Where permitted in your country, using the websites or providing us with your data for the purposes stated in the present policy, you fully understand and clearly accept the transfer of personal data abroad in the context of normal business operations of IK Multimedia US, LLC, including the collection, storage and processing of such data in the United States of America.
