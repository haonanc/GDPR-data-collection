(Updated: May 15, 2017)
YourMechanic, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("YourMechanic," “we” or “us”) has created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated in our Terms of Use and by registering for Services via the YourMechanic Platform, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given them in the Terms of Use.
Notification of Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time as our services change and expand. If we update this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy . Unless otherwise provided below, the revised Privacy Policy will take effect when it is posted. Once any changes become effective, your continued use of the YourMechanic Platform after such time will signify your acceptance of the new terms. If we are going to use your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below) in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in such different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that affect user information already stored in our database, we will notify you of the change and solicit your express acceptance of that change.
The YourMechanic Platform Contains Links to Other Sites
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other web sites to which the YourMechanic Platform links or which link to the YourMechanic Platform. By clicking on a link, logo, or other item, please note that you may no longer be on the YourMechanic Platform. To check what Internet location you are on, note the URL at the top and/or bottom of your browser. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statements of all third party web sites.
Information We Gather during Registration
If you register an Account or apply to become a Technician, we collect and store information that specifically identifies you or your account ("Personally Identifiable Information"). At this time, the most information you would be required to submit is your first name, last name, password, street address, city, state, zip/postal code, country, phone number, email address, and information about your vehicle such as: license plate, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), make, model, year, and engine size. Technician applicants will also be asked to provide information about their repair skills and abilities to perform Vehicle Services. For tax purposes, Technicians are also required to provide their Federal Tax ID or Social Security Number (as applicable in the United States). Users and Technicians wishing to pay for various fees or service retainers via credit card are also required to enter a valid credit card number and name as it appears on the credit card. Other information requested on our registration page, including the ability to receive promotional offers from us, is optional. We may, in the future, include other optional requests for information from you, to help us to tailor the YourMechanic Platform for you and deliver personalized information to you. We may supplement our information with additional information purchased from third parties for marketing purposes. Credit card information will be transmitted via SSL encryption for your protection.
Call and SMS Data
Our Services facilitate communication between Users and Technicians. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties' phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.
Online Order Placement and Management
The private and shared areas of the YourMechanic Platform help to facilitate communication and the exchange and sharing of information between Users and Technicians. The information contained in work orders is accessible by Us, the contracting User, and the contracting Technician. We may use non-Personally Identifiable Information from a work order (e.g., the scope of work or spend limit) for statistical analysis, product development, marketing, and research. We reserve the right to monitor communications throughout the YourMechanic Platform, and if we believe that a User is violating any of our agreements; international, federal or state laws; and/or our stated policies, we may terminate such usage.
Online Surveys and Contests
Occasionally, we conduct online user surveys to collect information about our Users' preferences. These surveys are optional, and if you choose to respond, your responses will be kept anonymous. Similarly, we may offer contests to qualifying Users in which we ask for contact and demographic information such as name, email address, and mailing address. None of this information is shared with third parties, except in summary form, if at all. The demographic information that we collect in the registration process and through online surveys is used to help us improve our services to meet the needs and preferences of our Users. This may include targeting advertising to you about our services. Information we gather through a contest may also be disclosed to third parties as necessary for prize fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering.
The YourMechanic Payment System
We offer a payment system that allows Users to pay with a credit card (the "Payment System"). If you make use of the Payment System, we will collect your credit card number and/or other entered financial institution information and will use that information to bill your membership fee and/or to perform the billing operation on behalf of the Technician, including but not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation.
Cookies and Automatically Gathered Information
We automatically collect your browser type and browser software version to tailor the presentation of the services to your browser and to maintain a record of your activity on the YourMechanic Platform. We use cookies to enable Users to specify unique preferences and to track User trends and patterns. Users always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. If you disable cookies on your browser, please note that some parts of the YourMechanic Platform may not function as effectively or may be considerably slower. As an automatic process, our web server software records a log file of IP addresses that access the YourMechanic Platform. We also collect IP address information but do not ordinarily link IP addresses to Users' Personally Identifiable Information. However, we can and will use IP addresses to identify a User when we, in our sole discretion, determine that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our various policies or to protect our service, the YourMechanic Platform, customers, or others.
Technician Profile
As part of registration, Technicians may set up a Profile describing their experience, rates, and qualifications. Some of the information requested in the Profile registration is mandatory. If you decide to offer your services through YourMechanic, this information may be used publicly. Potential Users will look to your Profile to help them decide whether to make use of your services.
How We Use Registration Information
We use Personally Identifiable Information for our own internal purposes including contacting you to inform you about updates to our services and providing you with information relating to transactions that you conduct on the YourMechanic Platform. We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law.
We do not rent or sell our Users' Personally Identifiable Information to third parties. We may send you email communications including information that we may think may be of interest to you, and we may provide your email address to third party partners if we believe their products or promotions may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving marketing emails at any time by modifying the Preferences section of your profile or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any marketing email you receive from us. In addition, to improve our ability to serve you relevant ads across the Internet for products that will be more interesting to you, we may provide your personal information to our advertising agents that use your information solely for our advertising purposes.
We may disclose and transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires our business. We may need to disclose your personal information when required by law or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process.
Use of General Data
We reserve the right to use the general data it obtains from Users' use of the YourMechanic Platform, including all statistical information. You acknowledge that such data belongs to us and that we shall have the right to use such data as we determine in our sole discretion.
Third Party Partners
We enter into relationships with third-party partners to provide products and services to our Users. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with certain third party partners as required to provide a specific product or service that you request from such a partner. However, these third party partners may not use this Personally Identifiable Information for any reason other than to provide the service or product that the User has explicitly signed up for. If you establish an Account through a third party partner (e.g., on a co-branded registration page), it is our general policy not to share anything other than summarized or aggregated data with the partner; however, any Personally Identifiable Information you provide may also be received by the partner and could be stored and used by them according to their privacy policy. Please take the time to review these third party privacy policies.
Transaction Intermediaries
We use an outside credit card processing company to bill Users for retainers and services. We believe these companies do not retain, share, store, or use Personally Identifiable Information for any secondary purposes. We use commercially reasonable efforts to restrict transaction intermediaries from using Personally Identifiable Information for purposes unrelated to the Services.
Technicians
Work orders placed on the YourMechanic Platform are completed by third-party Technicians. We may share the email addresses, phone numbers, or addresses of Users and Technicians once a project is awarded on our YourMechanic Platform to enable work on the project to be completed. These Technicians are not allowed to use Personally Identifiable Information except for the purpose of providing Vehicle Services.
Comments and Feedback Submitted by Users
We constantly seek to improve the quality and user experience of the Service. We value your input and encourage you to help us expand and make improvements to the YourMechanic Platform and the Service by providing us with any thoughts or comments you might have regarding the Service or the operation of the YourMechanic Platform. You can submit any comments you have to us by emailing to hi@yourmechanic.com . When sending us comments, we may receive your email address or User ID and the country in which you are located. This information is optional. If you provide this information, we will only use it to acknowledge or respond to your comments. Submitting comments via an email will not cause you to receive any secondary or promotional material unless specifically requested by you. In certain circumstances, we may ask for your permission to post your comments in marketing or promotional materials. We may send a request to receive Feedback on the YourMechanic Platform or the Service. You understand that information you provide as part of a feedback request, review, photo submission, or similar method will be available to other users and in some cases may be publicly available.
Security
We will use commercially reasonable methods to keep Personally Identifiable Information securely in our files and systems. Our payment site is operated using secure Internet connections, using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, to help protect your financial data. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of your Personally Identifiable Information, particularly, as it travels over the Internet. As such, we encourage you to exercise caution in determining what information you disclose via the Internet.
Terminating Your Account
We save your Personally Identifiable Information until your account with us is terminated. To terminate account, contact YourMechanic Customer Service as indicated on our contact page. If you terminate your account, your Personally Identifiable Information cannot be recovered, and you may continue to receive email communications for a short period of time until we have updated all of our databases. After termination of your account, your Personally Identifiable Information may remain on our archived database and records for a reasonable time as residual information. We will not use this residual information for business development purposes but may retain it and use it in connection with internal business purposes, such as internal record keeping and legal compliance. We will maintain information on Users who have been removed for violating any of our policies.
