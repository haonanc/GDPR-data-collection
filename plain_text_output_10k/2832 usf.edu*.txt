Privacy Request
This web page allows you to view and control the level of disclosure of your record             information.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) gives students the right to             refuse to permit USF disclose Directory Information.
What is disclosure?
Permission to release, or communicate personally identifiable information. Common             disclosures include: An enrollment verification to your insurance company; a degree             verification to a prospective employer; your name listed in the USF Directory, or             Commencement and Honors programs; or your name, address, or telephone number being             made available to the public for marketing purposes.
What is Student Directory Information?
Directory Information that USF may provide entities external to the institution includes             student name, major field of study, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees             and awards received or a lack thereof, participation in officially registered activities             and sports, and photographic image.
What information is not considered directory information?
Student ID number, Social Security Number, date of birth, citizenship, gender, grades,             GPA, email, and other similar items not specifically listed as Directory Information             are not disclosed to "non-university officials" without prior written consent of the             student.
When should privacy requests be submitted?
To be excluded from the annual printed USF Directory, your request for "Privacy" must             be received by the Office of the Registrar on the Tampa campus by the end of the second             week of classes each term. No public disclosures will be made until after this deadline.             The Office of the Registrar will accept privacy requests throughout the year but assumes             no responsibility for disclosures made prior to receipt of the request.
How long does my request last?
Privacy requests will become effective within 48 hours of receipt by the Office of             the Registrar and will remain in effect until you provide authorization to the Office             of the Registrar requesting removal.
What about inside USF?
