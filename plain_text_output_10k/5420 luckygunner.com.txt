LuckyGunner.com has a live inventory system that removes any out-of-stock items from our website the moment the last unit is ordered.
If you see it, we have it in stock and ready to ship.
If you place an order before 3 PM EST, your product will ship that same day. If you place an order after 3 PM EST or over the weekend, your product will ship the next business day.
If your order isn’t in stock and shipped on time, we will make it right and pay you $100.
