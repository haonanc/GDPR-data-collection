Slice’s services allow you to analyze and organize email receipts and related information in an integrated, actionable environment so you can obtain maximum benefits from your purchasing activities. To provide you with Slice’s services, including All My Purchases® and services that Slice provides to third-party websites, Slice collects information about you. As described below, Slice is able to offer its services to you for free through the development and marketing of anonymous consumer data. In this privacy policy we describe the information we collect and how we use and share it.  By using Slice’s websites, mobile apps, or services that facilitate the provision of such websites and mobiles apps ("Services"), and accepting the Terms of Service , you agree to this Privacy Policy.

I. SCOPE OF PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Slice. Our Privacy Policy does not apply when you navigate away from the Services.

Slice considers personal information to be information that can be used to determine the actual identity of a specific individual and to contact that person, such as name, address, email address, and/or phone number. We do not consider personal information to include information that, taken alone, does not allow a third party to easily identify and contact a specific individual.
