Our Principles
TomTom is all about where you are and getting to where you want to be. We help you achieve more. Sometimes we'll need to know some things about you in order to help you. While we collect and use your data, we fully understand that you value your privacy.
We believe privacy is about freedom and being able to decide for yourself who uses your data and how. This is why we have established our Privacy Principles:
1. We will always keep you fully informed about your data
We make sure you understand which data from or about you we use, why we use it, how long we use it and who can use it.
2. We enable you to remain in control of your data
We consider the data from or about you to be yours. We only use it for the purposes for which you have given it to us, or for which we collected it from you. You can opt out or opt in at any time using our software and websites.
3. We protect your data
Your data is yours. We keep it that way by protecting it as best as we reasonably can to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.
Our ten promises to you
1. We will tell you which data from or about you we use, why we use it, how long we use it, who else can use it, and where it is kept.
2. We will only use your data for the purposes we have stated to you.
3. We keep as little of your data as possible, and only for as long as we need it. When we no longer need data, we destroy it or we irreversibly anonymize it so it is no longer linked to you.
4. If we ask your permission to use your data for specific purposes, you will also be allowed to withdraw your permission.
5. If we can't reach you to ask your permission to collect and use your data and you don’t want us to use your data, just let us know and we will stop.
6. We will allow you to access and correct your data if it is linked to your MyTomTom account.
7. We will keep protecting your data against unauthorized access and accidental loss as best as we reasonably can.
8. If we engage others to use your information on our behalf, we will ensure they act in accordance with our policies.
9. We will not share your data with others without asking you for permission first, unless there is a legal obligation that prohibits us from asking.
10. We are here to answer any questions you have about how we use your data.
TomTom's policy on privacy and processing of personal data
We operate according to the privacy laws applicable in your country. Because we are based in Europe, European privacy laws also apply. These laws are considered to be the most extensive in the world. They offer a high level of protection to you by only allowing us to use your data when the strict conditions of these laws are met. Our company policy on privacy and processing of personal data reflects these laws and we apply this policy globally.

Data we collect
We collect data from you or about you when you use our sites, products, and services. The specific data we collect depends on what you use and how you use it. In general, there are 3 categories of data we collect and use:

This data can include, for example, your name, email address, the search terms you enter, your address and favorite locations, your phone number, any map errors reports and speed camera reports you enter, your size, weight, gender, age etc. etc.
Data collected via sensors
A lot of our products come equipped with one or more sensors or use the sensors of the devices they run on. Examples of sensors are GPS receivers, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth receivers, a camera, a microphone, G-force sensors, heart rate sensors, and touch sensitive screens. These sensors will automatically collect data when activated. Depending on the purpose for which it was captured, this data along with data that identifies you or your device can be sent to TomTom and others for subsequent use.
Metadata
This refers to any data that is collected or automatically generated while you use TomTom sites, products, or services. In many cases metadata is collected or generated as a part of using a computing device or transmitting data over computer networks, such as the internet. This data includes user interface and other device usage events, IP-addresses, unique device identifiers, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, cookies, and records of computer activity.
Data we receive from others
We receive data from third parties that they have collected, under their responsibility and in accordance with their privacy policy, and shared with us.

We receive real-time feeds of location, speed, sensors, and other vehicle and device information from, for example, mobile phone users, business fleets, and vehicles that are equipped with our online maps or traffic and travel services. We use this data only after we have made sure it cannot be linked back to you.
