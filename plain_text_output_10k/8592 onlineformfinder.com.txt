In the event that any of your data is to be transferred in such a manner, you may be contacted in advance and informed of the changes. If contacted you will be given the choice to have your data deleted or withheld from the new owner or controller.
How can I control information about me?
When you submit personal data via finder.com , you may be given options to restrict Our use of your data.

the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between you and us;
providing access would prejudice our negotiations; or
