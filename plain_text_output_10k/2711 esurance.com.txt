We may  also obtain personal information from third parties, such as consumer reporting  agencies, with your consent or from other third parties who you have consented  to providing information to us. The form of consent may vary depending on the  circumstances and the type of information being sought. In limited cases, we  may obtain personal information about you without your consent if we are permitted  to do so by law.

We may  provide your information to others whom we determine need such information to  perform insurance or other professional functions for us. These may include  parties helping us with administrative services and consumer reporting  agencies.
We may  supply information as required by search warrant, subpoena, or legal process when  required by law, or to protect our own legal interests in the event of suspected illegal or fraudulent activities.
If we  collect your information as an agent for one of our business partners, we may  use it to contact you or make you an offer regarding auto insurance that may be of interest to you.
We may  disclose your information to third parties to confirm insurance, settle claims  and resolve disputes, and enforce our legal rights
Any entity that we may  share your information with is required to keep the information confidential  and use it only for the purposes for which it was shared, except as otherwise required  or permitted by law.

However, you may withdraw your  consent to certain uses of your personal information (for example, see the "Esurance communications" and "Website cookies and other digital markers" sections below). If  you withdraw your consent, we may still retain your personal information, as  applicable, for at least as long as we have a business relationship with you,  there are any outstanding claims or possible claims, and/or in keeping with our  record retention schedule and legal obligations. When we dispose of personal  information, we use reasonable procedures designed to prevent unauthorized  persons from gaining access to such information during or after the destruction  process.
