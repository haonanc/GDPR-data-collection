Parents can, at any time, refuse to permit us to collect any more personal data about their children, and can request that we delete from our records all of the personal data that we have collected about their children. Parents should keep in mind that a request to delete such information about their children means that their children will not be able to utilize our Website.

It will be necessary for you to authenticate yourself as the child’s parent in order to receive any information about that child.
