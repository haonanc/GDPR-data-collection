Types of Information We Collect
When you visit our Site we may store information obtained or provided during your web session. We may also assign you one or more “cookies”. Our Site utilizes cookies to collect for, among other things, general Site and web usage patterns. Information gathered from cookies may include the date and time of visits, the Site pages viewed, time spent at our Site and the websites that you visited before and after your visit to our Site. Our Site’s servers also automatically identify                your computer by its Internet protocol (“IP”) address, which is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider. Your IP address may be used to address problems with our server, administer                our Site and/or to gather broad demographic information about our users. In addition, the other websites that you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.
The majority of browsers accept cookies, but the “Help” menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies. However, please be aware that if you block cookies, some Site functionality                may be lost. If you wish to opt-out of the display of targeted advertisements, you may do so by clicking here to visit the Network Advertising Initiative site to set preferences and opt out of third-party targeting cookies used by vendors including Google, Turn and others. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.                You will continue to receive generic ads.
In addition to the information we collect using cookies, we also collect information, including personally identifiable information, that you actively provide directly to us. For example, through an account created on this Site or communications                (such as emails) you may send to us. We may maintain your email and the information therein, including your e-mail address and any personally identifiable information contained in the e-mail. Information collected in this manner is subject                to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
In addition to the information you provide to us, and what is provided through cookies, we may receive, collect or record various types of hardware and software information. Such information can include technical or functional information                such as interface type, software types and applications, communications data and communications details.
Any information you provide directly or indirectly to us (other than personally identifiable information), whether by direct entry, submission, e-mail, or otherwise (including data, questions, comments, or suggestions), will be treated as                non-confidential and non-proprietary and will become the property of Hotel JV Services, LLC (the “Company”). Such information may be used for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to disclosure, transmission, publication, broadcast,                commercial dissemination, and posting. The Company shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to us for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing and                marketing services using such information.
Use of Collected Information
The information we collect is used for various business purposes. For example, we may use the information collected to enhance our Site to make it easier, faster and more effective to use. In addition, we may use information to customize                a user’s Site experience to better suit the user’s needs, and to develop our services. Additionally, cookies provide us information about how many people visit our Site, when they visit and how they use our Site. We may also use the information                collected to collaborate with other businesses in order to drive relevant content to you. Information collected may result in your viewing of particular advertising tailored to your interests based on your activities on our Site and a shopping experience customized to you in content and services.
Our goal is to provide you with the most recent and compelling information to help you qualify your hotel booking decisions. To that end we may email you about destinations and/or hotels that may interest you, based on the information you                have provided — whether directly or indirectly. With each email you receive, you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive future email correspondence. We also may share similar content with you via social media channels, like                Facebook, if you have provided us with your social media contact information.
