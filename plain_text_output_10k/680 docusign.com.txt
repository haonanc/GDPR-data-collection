At DocuSign, privacy is a priority. This Privacy Policy sets out how DocuSign, Inc. and its group of companies (“us,” “our,” or “we”) collect and use information from customers and other individuals who access or use our websites, including docusign.com and docusign.net, our mobile applications, our web client or professional client, and/or any of our other sites, products, or services that link to this Privacy Policy (the “Services”). By using our Services, you understand that we will collect and use your information as described in this Privacy Policy (collectively “you”).
If you or your organization has an individual agreement with us, that agreement may have privacy terms that also apply to the information you provide to us under that agreement. Please review the terms in that agreement because they may be different or more restrictive than the terms in this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, including any that are linked to in our Services. You should review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.
DocuSign’s core product and services help users create, complete, and show the validity of digital or electronic transactions, such as electronically signing a contract for mobile phone services or placing a digital signature on a loan application. As part of our Services, users want us to collect and record information that helps the parties prove the validity of the transactions. This information includes the persons who are involved in the transactions and the devices those persons use.
We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy in full to ensure you are fully informed. However, if you want to access a particular section of this Privacy Policy, please refer to the below table.
