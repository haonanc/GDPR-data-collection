We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This data is not used to track or monitor personally identifiable information of individual Users. We gather and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Site or Services, identify Users when they visit the Site or use the Services, track Users' movements on the Site or through use of the Services, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

We may use spot light ads, cookies, JavaScript, web beacons, GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.
When you visit the Site, the server housing the pages automatically generates a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through the Site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we're providing is being used.
Users may be directed to the Site or Services via banner ads or site links. Ads or Site links that are placed by the Site use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from the user.
Cookies
Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a User's hard drive, are employed by thousands of sites to enhance users' Web viewing the Site. Cookies allow sites and advertisers to "remember" users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify Users, although they do identify a User's computer. We use session and persistent cookies for remembering User preferences and current session information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site.
As you browse the Site, online ad networks we work with may place anonymous cookies on your computer, and use similar technologies, in order to understand your interests based on your (anonymous) online activities, and to tailor more relevant ads to you. If you do not wish to receive such tailored advertising, you may use the opt-out tool of the Network Advertising Initiative found here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices , or the opt-out tool of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) found here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices . Opting out of tailored advertising will not prevent you from seeing ads altogether, and we cannot guarantee that these opt-out tools will always be effective; the opt-out tools are simply designed to ensure your ads will not be delivered through targeting methods from these online ad networks. We and our online ad networks provide opt-out mechanisms through the tools linked above and do not currently respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.

California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing legal@careerarcgroup.com .
