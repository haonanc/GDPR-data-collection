You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take             advantage of some of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding             to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our website, and communicating with you.

If you do not want us to use cookies, you can easily disable them by going to the toolbar of your web             browser, and clicking on the “help” button. Follow the instructions that will prevent the browser from             accepting cookies, or set the browser to inform you when you receive a new cookie.

In addition, we automatically collect other information such as             email addresses, browser types, operating systems, and the URL addresses of sites clicked to and from this             site.
Information from Other Sources. We might receive information about you from other sources             and add it to our account information. This may include updated delivery and address information from our             shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication             more easily.
How Do We Use Your Information?
Customized Shopping. We use your information to better serve you by providing a customized             shopping experience. As noted above, you may “opt-out” of this customization, or even visit and shop             anonymously.
Agents. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.             Examples include delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments.             They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other             purposes.
Special Offers. We may send you special offers from time to time, unless you choose to             “opt-out” of receiving such offers. In addition, we may also send you special offers from other companies.             Again, you may “opt-out”.
Advertising. We use your data for advertising purposes. We use third-party advertising             companies who serve ads to help keep content free. For these partners, we put additional restrictions on how             your data can be used to prevent it from misuse. For instance, we do not allow these partners to take your             information for profiling and personalizing ads on other sites. Please review the following for a full list             of partners and purposes: PubGalaxy (Titan Gate AD) .
How Do We Protect the Security of Your Information?
We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)             software, which encrypts information you input.
We use encryption to protect your information contained in our customer list.
We limit access to your information on a “need to know” basis.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure             to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
No system can guarantee absolute security, just as the finest lock can not guarantee physical security.             However, we take every reasonable precaution to assure that your data is secure.
