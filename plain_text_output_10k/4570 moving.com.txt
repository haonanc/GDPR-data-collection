I chose Good Greek to move my 5,000+ 3 story house from Knoxville to Palm Beach and I am so glad I did.  From the beginning Michael followed up with me on every question I had (and I had many) almost instantly.  If he didn’t have the answer he checked with his boss and got back to me quickly.  The move was going to be challenging because our home in Tennessee wasn’t accessible for a semi.  Good Greek decided to rent a local truck, load it at our house then transport it to a truck stop and reload it to the semi.  I had three of the most wonderful men as movers:  Jose, Jonathan and Manny.  Out of all the movers we have had in the past I can not say enough about how amazing these guys were. They took time to be sure all the “special things” were packed correctly and communicated with me constantly.  Not one time did I hear a complaint or negative comment about anything I asked them to do.   Good Greek accommodated my need to pack one weekend then hold everything until the next weekend due to closing dates of houses.  They scheduled the same team to unpack me which was wonderful.   Jose, Manny and Jonathon Manny once again did an amazing job unpacking everything.  They didn’t rush to just get done and go home.  They actually cared and were concerned about my things.  I even have very fine European Crystal that I have broken before just from hand washing them and NOT ONE OF THEM were broken during the move.  I was amazed!!!! The only mistake I made during the move was purchasing the additional insurance, with these guys I didn’t need it!!!!! Amazing job Good Greek Movers!!!  You guys have got it going on!  I will recommend and use only you in the future!   PS. I don’t know what you pay this team but whatever it is, it’s not enough!  They are great ambassadors for your company!read more

It's easy to give a five star review when everything goes smoothly as planned. We had the hottest day all summer, and due to so many people moving that day we had only two gentlemen moving us. Those guys worked nonstop, but the move went far longer than they expected, and our bed headboard fell and was damaged. Robert Lopez had booked our move, and as he promised, despite the prolonged hours, we were only charged exactly what he gave us as an estimate. And the headboard? Within 48hours he had Allan at our door, who repaired the headboard so beautifully that friends can't find the "damaged" area! Without a doubt, we made the right choice choosing Good Greek!read more

Outstanding move from Ft.Lauderdale to North Carolina.  From our 1st meeting with Michael to our moving team of 3 lead by Alex.  The movers were incredibly prompt, polite and fast.  We also had items that were not properly boxed and they wrapped up and placed on truck.  The final result everything arrived on time and not a single broken item.  Another major plus, the same team who packed us up, delivered the goods on the other end!  Recommend them every day, any day.  Call Good Greek Movers!read more

Last month, we had furniture delivered to my new home. Greek movers loaded the truck on February 27 and delivered it the following day soon after I closed on the home. They responded soon after I called to give them the okay. Although they did not have too much to move, I did have a few pieces that needed to be assembled after they disassembled it. I also had a Sleep Number bed they took apart and connected back together. I had a lot of concerns seeing as my last move years ago with another local company was a terrible experience. Greek Movers, particularly Alex and Luis, were professional and worked tirelessly to get the job done with no mishaps. I kept taking out more tip money seeing how hard they worked. I would hire Greek again and recommend them to anyone.read more

We moved from NJ to Florida in October. When Christian and his partner ( I called speedy the moving man) came to our home the 18 wheeler van could not fit up my 1500 ft long narrow driveway.  They actually had to go get  a smaller truck packed it up then drive to the 18wheeler unpack and come back. We had ran out of boxes and they not only supplied some boxes and tape they also boxed up our things. Christian and Speedy (wish I could remember his real name :( ) securely wrapped all our furniture and items. I had one very special box that I explained to Christian was the most important box he was moving.  I actually was going to take it with me but felt so comfortable with these two professional and friendly gentlemen that I decided to let them take it.It was the last box to leave with these two wonderful men.  They arrived in Fl before we did but were at my new home the very next day we got there. They came with a smile and more hands so this visit was quick. They set up everything exactly where I asked them to and all done with friendly faces. They even provided me with a comedy show. We moved my husbands ride on mower down and he was not home at the time so they had the duty to get it started and going. Thats when the show began. A few took turns trying to get it started and drive. Funny watching them riding in circles trying to get the mower to go straight. Christian saved the day though. Christian also came in personally carrying my very special box. Everything was delivered without incident. This was all accomplished at a price that was better than others and NO EXTRA FEES ! What we were quoted was the final price. We really do not have plans on moving again but if we ever do I know who to call. Thanks for the memorable experience.read more

My husband and I have moved several times over the past 20 years, and we have never had as pleasant an experience as we had with Greek Moving and Storage. We received a fair estimate which was actually reduced on the day of our move when we decided not to move one room of furniture. The furniture from our 4 bedroom home was expertly and carefully wrapped and loaded on the truck in less than 3 hours, and equally as professionally unloaded and resembled in our new home. There is simply no reason to look any further than Greek Moving and Storage for your moving needs!read more

Greek Movers and Storage is the best ; hands down!  Before I booked my move with other movers,  the other movers could not complete with Greek Movers and Storage have thr very best rates,  first month's storage ay no cost to me. My journey began when I called. Greek Movers ; Nick came to my home in Riveria Beach, Florida  and gave be a hard dollar quote for moving and for maybe two months or more. When movers arrived as scheduled. Scott Duval and crew arrived and immediately started packing and moving boxes to their moving van. Friendly,  helpful and courteous.  Outstanding and professional movers.  My furniture and personal belongings where stored as agreed. Approximatley two months, I phoned Greek Movers and spoke with Reesa. I expained to Reesa when we needed our furniture. No problems what so ever. Again friendly, helpful and professional. During the delivery process Zac called to ensure all was going as planned. Great service. My furniture was delivered as panned. My furniture and personal belongings arrived in the same condition as when first packed. All in all; great service,  trained and professional staff - top to bottom and reasonable cost. No other professional movers and storage could complete with Greek Moving and Storage. I totally and honestly highly recommend Greek Movers and Storage if you are looking for professional, reliable,  safe and cost effective movers and storage theirs only one for me; and that's Greek Movers and Storage.

They did a great job, were respectful, took pride in their work, were caring with my belongings, trustworthy, wrapped everything with wrap and/or blankets.  I was totally impressed and would highly recommend them (and have already) and that should say a lot as I would say I am a pretty picky/particular person! However, after packing up my house in 3 weeks, I hope I don't have to use them for a long, long time! Thanks Greek Moving!  Efharisto!read more

Greek Moving & Storage was recommended to us by a couple who came to our moving sale.  We had spoken with quite a few movers over the last month and figured one more couldn't hurt and we needed to make a decision.  From the first  phone contact,  we were impressed.  Very professional all the way.  They came out and gave us a firm quote for the total  job.  No hidden charges.  Arrived on time,as promised on moving day (5/18/15).  Packed and loaded all our belongings.  We couldn't move to our new home until today.  Our things were kept in the truck (not intermingled with other households ) and kept at their warehouse until this morning,  when they drove to our new home inSummerfield , FL  4 hours away.  They arrived as promised at noon today.  We could not have adked for a better moving experience.  Professionals all the way. Honest and dependable.read more
