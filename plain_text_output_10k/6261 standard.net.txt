IX.        HSF DONOR PRIVACY POLICY / STATEMENT
HSF respects the privacy of its donors.  This section of the Privacy Policy relates specifically to our donors.  Our general website Privacy Policy provides helpful information about our data practices. Please see the Privacy Policy above for terms governing our general website privacy terms and related information and disclosures.
HSF Donor Privacy Statement:  HSF will never trade, share or sell Donor Personal Information with anyone else, except as required by law.  For purposes of our Donor Privacy Policy, “Donor Personal Information” means information that identifies donors personally, such as a donor’s name, address, email address, and telephone number.  HSF maintains Donor Personal Information for purposes of informing you of opportunities to participate in and/or support the mission and work of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund. At any time, you may request to be removed from our contact list or revoke your authorization (if previously given) for HSF to share Personal Information. To do so, simply  contact us .
Collection of Donor Information.  If you register to participate in an HSF event (e.g. a dinner, outreach event, golf tournament, etc.) using our event registration site, we collect your Donor Personal Information.  We may also ask you if you are an HSF scholarship recipient to better understand the community involvement of our alumni.
Contribution.  If you choose to use a credit card to donate or purchase through this site, we process through a secure third party payment gateway, Authorize.net standard credit card information (card number, card type, expiration date) and keep a record of your financial transaction. Credit card numbers are passed through Authorize.net only until the charge can be processed (usually several minutes). HSF does not retain credit card information. If you submit your credit card information on paper, the information is destroyed immediately after the transaction is complete.
Requests.  If you submit an online request for HSF products such as free brochures, or submit a question through a “contact us” query, we may have to gather additional information from you to respond to your request. Such information will vary with the request but often includes name, shipping address, telephone number, and email address.
Use of Donor Data.  If you provide Donor Personal Information to HSF, we may enter your name into our constituent database and contact you in order to:
Complete voluntary surveys seeking feedback for quality and service improvement purposes.
Supply you with information including HSF related news, HSF programs, events and services.
Request voluntary time or monetary contributions to HSF.
Request your participation in an HSF research studies.
 
Additionally, our annual report publishes the names of individuals who contribute $1,000 and above. You may, however, choose to waive this benefit by designating your support as “anonymous.” This ensures your name will never appear on any public, HSF donor list.
This Donor Privacy Policy applies to all Donor Personal Information that HSF receives, both online (including through its website or mobile applications) and offline, as well as other electronic, written, or oral communications.  To the extent any donations are processed through a third-party service provider, Donor Personal Information will be used only for purposes of processing the donation.
X.          DONOR BILL OF RIGHTS
The Hispanic Scholarship Fund adheres to the Donor Bill of Rights created by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), the Association for Healthcare Philanthropy (AHP), the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), and the Giving Institute: Leading Consultants to Non-Profits.

To be informed of the organization's mission, of the way the organization intends to use donated resources, and of its capacity to use donations effectively for their intended purpose.
