Tempur Sealy and our third party service providers collect Information about you from a variety of sources, including Personal Information you provide directly to us when you order, purchase, or register a product, request information or samples, or otherwise communicate with us, and Information we collect about you when you access or use our Online Services and otherwise interact with us.  We also collect Information about you from third parties including other online services and our business partners.  We may combine any of the Information collected about you for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Information.  Personal Information includes your name, address (both billing and shipping addresses), e-mail address, credit card information, and/or phone number. Each piece individually is a piece of Personal Information, and we collect varying amounts of Personal Information based on how you engage with us.

Information Security
We seek to keep your Personal Information secure and implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to help us protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. We use industry-standard encryption technology to provide for the security of customer credit card information.
