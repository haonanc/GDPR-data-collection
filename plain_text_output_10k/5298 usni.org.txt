While we may undertake efforts to see that any third party to or with which we share, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose personal data is under a contractual obligation to use the personal data solely for the purposes for which the data was disclosed, we are not responsible for their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices.
