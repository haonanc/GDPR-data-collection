This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below or in an Addendum), and does not govern the data practices of third parties that may interact with our Service, or that operate LCE-branded online services under license and contract that we may link to, including  http://www.littlecaesarsstuff.com  and  www.littlecaesarslistens.com , or that operate LCE-branded franchise store locations.

The Full Detailed Privacy Policy
1. What Information Does the Service Collect?
a. Information You Provide to Us.
Personal Information and Demographic Information.  On the Service, we may ask you to provide us (and/or our vendors) with the following categories of information: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, including your first and last name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, credit card information (“Personal Information”); and (2) demographic information, including your zip code, frequency of visits, purchase amounts, and items purchased (“Demographic Information”). We can collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service or when you interact with the Service. To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. 
b. Information We Collect or Store As You Access and Use the Service Generally.
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (“Usage Information”).  This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Service.  To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information. 
This Usage Information includes:
your IP address, UDID, advertising identifier, and device identifier (“Device Identifier”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
your Device functionality (browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
the URL that referred you to our Service;
the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there;
your Device location;
Device data and the time of day.
Our App may access and read accounts, data and/or content on your Device, add content to your Device, and change settings of your Device, for the following reasons (i) allowing you to access and use the Service (or certain of its features and functions); (ii) showing you the closest Little Caesars to you; (iii) saving app images and sound files and writing usage logs to the Device; (iv) sending Facebook and Twitter messages you initiate; (v) sending and receiving data needed for App operations;   (vi) to provide you notice when you are not connected to a network; and (vii) in connection with your Service usage.  You consent to these activities by installing the App or otherwise using the Service.  Your Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See  Section 6  for more information) and you can disable all of them associated with the App by uninstalling the App.
We may use various now and later developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“Tracking Technologies”).  Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.  The App may also receive signals from and otherwise interact with Tracking Technologies that exist in the physical world.   Tracking Technologies include:
Cookies.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service.  A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.  Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. 
Web Beacons.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our Service’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies can be used to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
Embedded Scripts. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about the links you click on and other of your interactions with the Service.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
Browser Fingerprinting.  Collection and analysis of information from your Device, including your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts, for purposes of identification.
ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.  If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.  Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier.  ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.
Location-identifying Technologies.  Additionally, the Services may use GPS (global positioning systems) software, RFID (radio frequency identification), cellular and Wi-Fi data, and other subsequent location-based technologies and methods later developed. These can use geo-fencing and iBeacons to locate you so we may verify your location, provide directions to our nearest Little Caesars, coordinate the preparation of your order based on your distance from a Little Caesars, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as monitor via the Service the efficiency of the services we provide to you.  Upon downloading the App, we provide location-based services to your approximate and/or exact location information.  Geo-fencing utilizes GPS and RFID signals to create a virtual boundary around a geographic area of our choosing, thereby allowing us to determine when you are in proximity to a Little Caesars. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App (“iBeacons”).  Because iBeacons are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Services and send you more specific and relevant messages and offers.  In addition, we can track the efficiency of the service you receive from Little Caesars, by knowing when you enter or exit a Little Caesars or when you arrive in the parking lot for a carryout order.  You should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to other people.  Your Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See  Section 6  form more information).  
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.
Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.
We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed. We may also provide you with a choice as to the level of data you share with us. The Service may be limited and some features may not be available based on what data you elect and/or consent to share with us. For more information on how to exercise preferences as to our features, functionality and communications, see  Section 6 , for choices regarding our service providers see  Section 3(b), and for options regarding advertising and advertisers see  Section 6(d).  
Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.  Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.  Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies.  For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe’s website  http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html .  Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. 
Tracking Technologies in connection with App usage outside of a browser can only be disabled by uninstalling the App.  To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. 
For information on third party Tracking Technologies and browser Do Not Track signals, see the next section.
Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track. 
Third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service. They may do so to enable the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.

c. Information Third Parties Provide About You.
We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, when they submit content to us or post or interact with the Service.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties.  To the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.  For persons outside of Canada, in no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties. 
d. Interactions with Third-Party Services.
The Service has functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or application.  The use of this functionality can involve the third-party operator providing Personal Information, to us.  You may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to interact with our Service. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to us.  If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service.  In addition, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. We may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.  These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.  LCE may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.  Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.  You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service. 
e. Information You Provide About a Third Party.
The Service may allow you to send someone else an invitation or other communication. If so, the information you provide is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. You must have the permission of your family member or friend to provide us with their personal information. You may only provide email addresses of friends with whom you have had direct voluntary two-way communications, and with whom it is reasonable to conclude you have a personal relationship considering shared interests, experiences, opinions and other relevant factors. You may only provide email addresses of family members with whom you are related by marriage, a common-law partnership, or parent-child relationship, and with whom you have had direct voluntary two-way communication.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Service, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s), and the communication will indicate it was sent at your request and on your behalf.  Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies as further detailed in  Section 1(d)  and  Section 5 .

3. How and When Do We Share Information with Third Parties?
We may share your in-App game/activity-related information, your username, and your activities and scores, with other users of the Service or the public. We may share non-Personal Information, including aggregated user statistics, with third parties. For instance, if we de-identify data about you, it is not treated as Personal Information by us, and we may share it with others freely. We may share Personal Information and non-Personal Information related to your transactions with third parties in connection with, and for purposes related to, the transactions. For example, if you use the Service to make a purchase with one of our LCE-branded franchise store locations, we may share personal information related to your purchase with that location. We may share your Device Identifiers with third parties along with other Usage Information and data related to you and your activities, for the purposes set out in this Policy.  However, we do not share your Personal Information that we have collected directly from you on our Service with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes unless we have given you the ability to choose to consent or withhold consent to such sharing at the time you provide your Personal Information, in which case we will honor your choice.  We may share your Personal Information and other information with our franchise stores and vendors in connection with a consumer service inquiry or complaint for the purpose of responding.  In addition, we may share your Personal Information, and other information we have collected about you as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as described below or otherwise to the extent not prohibited by applicable law except to the extent set forth in this Privacy Policy.

b. Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.
We use third-party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of us or the Service, hosting the Service, designing and/or operating the Service’s features, tracking the Service’s activities and analytics, and enabling us to send you special offers or perform other administrative services.  We may provide these vendors with access to Usage Information, Personal Information and other user data, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us.  Third-party analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to your Personal Information and other information about you.

These other sites can choose to associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect your Personal Information and other data about you, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.
Third-party applications may also be available via the Service.  The owners of these applications (“Third-Party Owners”) may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices.  We are not responsible for how Third-Party Owners or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others.  These Third-Party Owners may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same.  We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of Third-Party Owners.  Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications.

In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child, we will dispose of that information in accordance with COPPA and other applicable laws and regulations.  If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information without COPPA-required consent, please contact us  here .

In the event that we become aware that we have collected personal information from any child, we will dispose of that information in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.  If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your minor child has provided us with personal information, please contact us  here .
