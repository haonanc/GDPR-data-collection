(i.) Whenever we require your consent for the processing of your personal information such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). This article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully.
(ii.) If the processing of your personal data is necessary for the perfor-mance of a contract between you and GetYourGuide or for taking any pre-contractual steps upon your request, such processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b).”). If this data is not processed, GetYourGuide will not be able to execute the contract with you.

IX. SOCIAL NETWORKS
Our website contains links to social networks (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn). These social networks are operated exclusively by third parties. If you follow the links, information may be transmitted to these third parties. We use the so-called 2-click solution. This means, in general, that no personal data will be passed on if you visit our site.

Your personal data will only be transmitted to third parties if this is legally permitted or if you have given your prior consent. In particular, we will not sell your data to third parties or market it in any other way.

XII. DATA TRANSMISSION TO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EU
As far as this is necessary for the initiation or execution of the contract - e.g. to process bookings for activities in countries outside the EU - we will transmit your data outside the EU. The same applies if such a transmission turns out to be necessary for our purposes. In this respect, we ensure that the data recipient guarantees an appropriate level of data protection and that no other interests worthy of protection conflict with the data transmission. GetYourGuide relies on derogations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR in the event no “adequacy” decision and no other safeguards under the GDPR are in place (for example binding corporate rules on the transfer outside the EEA). In particular, we collect and transfers to countries outside the EU personal data only: with your explicit consent; to perform a contract with you; in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. If this data is not processed and transferred, GetYourGuide will not be able to execute the contract with you or you will not have access to any or all of the benefits and features associated with your transaction. We endeavour to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with GetYourGuide and the practices described in this Privacy Statement.

Our employees and all persons involved in data processing are obliged to comply with the data protection laws and to treat personal data confidentially. Our employees have been trained accordingly. Both internal and external audits ensure compliance with all data protection processes at GetYourGuide.
We use a secure online transmission procedure, the so-called "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) transmission, to protect the personal data of our users. You can see this from the fact that an "s" (https://) is added to the address component http://, or a green, closed lock icon is displayed. By clicking on the icon, you will receive information about the SSL certificate used. The display of the icon depends on the browser version used by you. The SSL encryption guarantees that your data is transmitted in an encrypted and complete way.
