COLLECTION
Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is personal information such as your name or a family members’ name, your e-mail address, mailing address, or telephone number.
We collect PII when you visit our website and when you voluntarily submit it to us.  We collect it when you create a Royalty account, enter into a sweepstakes or contest, make a purchase, complete a survey, contact us or make an inquiry, or join our eClub or other online forums.

If, at any time, you leave our website and are redirected to a third party website or application, you are no longer governed by this policy and your PII will be treated in accordance with the provider’s policy. If someone purchases an e-gift card for you, we can receive your email address and other PII about you from that person.  
We do not knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen without the prior consent of the child’s parent or legal guardian. If you believe that your child under the age of thirteen gave us PII online, please contact the privacy officer and we will take appropriate action.
