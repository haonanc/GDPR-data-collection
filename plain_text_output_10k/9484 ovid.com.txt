Cookies
Innovid may collect the data, including personal data, using cookies, which are small text files stored on the visitor’s computer. Visitors can set their browser to reject cookies altogether, to reject Innovid’s cookies in particular, or to delete cookies. An End User of the Services may opt-out of interest-based advertising from Innovid; please refer to the Section entitled “Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising” below. For our EU based website visitors, we may also put in place a Cookie Control Tool on our site.
Innovid’s Services
Innovid partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to visitors of third party websites and other online media (such visitors are referred to as “End Users”).
As an End User browses the Internet, he or she may visit Web pages, mobile applications or other online media that make use of the Services. When this happens, an End User’s browser or device may request advertisements from Innovid’s system, and Innovid may collect data about this interaction, as well as about any further interaction by such End User with the advertisements provided by the Services and the pages or media on which such Services are utilized, such as impressions, clicks, mouse movements, viewing duration, IP address, date and time of interaction, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other Non-PII made available by the browser or device. In addition, in the event that the data being collected is from a mobile device, Innovid may also collect the mobile advertising ID of the device (e.g. IDFA and Google AdID). On occasion, Innovid may also receive from third parties personal data that enables advertisement optimization, independent of or in combination with the data collected by Innovid, such as audience interest segments and product categories.
The data collected by Innovid and/or received from third parties may be shared and used to provide information and reports to advertisers, agencies and publishers who participate in the Services, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity, to administer and enhance the Services and perform internal analysis, and to help Innovid display, optimize, target and/or customize advertisements to the interests or preferences of End Users. Innovid may use certain general health-related segments received from third parties in delivering advertisements based on inferred End User interest in such topics, such as general health, wellness, common ailments and illnesses, beauty and fitness. Such health-related segments do not include sensitive health information (such as an End User having a certain medical condition like heart disease or arthritis).
From time to time, advertisements served by Innovid may contain functionality that enables an End User to enter personal data into such advertisements or into the landing page to which such advertisements are linked, in order to allow the End User to sign-up for or receive information regarding an advertiser or publisher’s product, service, program or other offer. In the event that an End User elects to provide personal data under such circumstances, Innovid may store such information and may share it with the advertiser, agency or publisher on behalf of whom the advertisement was served, and/or with such entity’s service provider. Innovid may use such information to fulfill or aid in the fulfillment of the End User’s request and/or to auto-populate future requests by the End User’s device. In cases where the advertisement contains functionality enabling Innovid to store personal data, the End User will have the option to opt-out of the storage of such information by indicating its preference in the appropriate checkbox shown in the advertisement, or by clicking through to the settings available through the advertisement. The End User should review the advertiser or publisher’s privacy policy to understand how such entity will process any personal data entered by the End User or captured. If you would like Innovid to delete all records of your personal data, or exercise your rights of access, rectification, portability, and so on, please send us an email at privacy@innovid.com.
Innovid works with Nielsen to better understand the reach of ad campaigns. To learn more about what information Nielsen collects, how it uses and shares that information and your choices, please visit http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy.
Innovid collects personal data based on several bases, depending on the exact circumstances. Registration Data and Account Data is processed on the basis of a contract between Innovid and the customer; we are not able to provide services and meet the terms of our customer agreements without such processing. Personal data may also be processed on the basis of the legitimate interest Innovid has in serving and measuring advertising, and analyzing, improving, optimizing and personalizing its users’ experience.
To opt-out of any of the processing described in this policy, you may contact Innovid and its Data Protection Officer at privacy@innovid.com. Data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (the UK ICO).
Cross-Device Tracking
Innovid may, or may use the services of third party companies to, establish connections between a user’s devices and to provide interest-based advertising across devices. Cross-device connections allow Innovid to understand that a single user is accessing advertisements served or measured by Innovid from multiple devices and to synchronize or target advertising messages and/or measure the performance of advertisements across those devices. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices with respect to it, please: (1) visit the NAI Mobile Choices page located here or the Ghostery opt-out program (currently available at https://www.ghostery.com/support/global-opt-out/ to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes; and (2) download the AppChoices application, available for iOS and Android (see http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices ), to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in mobile apps.

Opt-Out of Interest-Based Advertising
End Users can opt out of interest-based advertising served by Innovid. Click Here to opt-out, or opt-out through the NAI page located here. In order to comply with an opt-out request, Innovid may set a non-unique cookie for the sole purpose of complying with such request. If an End User deletes its cookies or changes computers or devices after opting out, he or she will need to opt out again by clicking the link in this paragraph. Please note that where an End User blocks cookies on his or her browser, Innovid will be unable to set an opt-out cookie, and therefore unable to abide by such End User opt-out request. In addition, to opt out on a mobile device, you may visit the NAI Mobile Choices opt-out page located here . Following an opt-out, Innovid’s system will still provide advertisements to the End User. Please note, however, that these advertisements may be less relevant to such End User’s interests.
