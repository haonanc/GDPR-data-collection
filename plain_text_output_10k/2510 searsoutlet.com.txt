We may use your PII to: process and fulfill your order; notify you of your order status; provide you with mobile alerts; prevent fraud and otherwise provide you with customer service; respond to your inquiries and requests; create an account and register you as a registered Site user; to send you information regarding this Site, as well as about our products, programs or services; customize your experience on this Site and on other SHO Sites; or provide you with other services. We may also use the PII we collect from and about you for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products and services, enhancing our Site, improving our services, personalizing your experiences, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.
We also collect certain information about your use of the Site ("Usage-Information" - for example, interests, hobbies, lifestyle choices, groups with whom you are affiliated) from you when you visit this Site.

We may share your PII with service providers that need access to your PII to provide operational or other support services, such as credit card processors, shipping agents, installation and delivery, call center and live chat support, and product fulfillment vendors, who must maintain reasonable security procedures and practices safeguard your PII. Unless otherwise disclosed to you, our service providers are prohibited from using your PII for their own marketing purposes.

Interest-Based Ads & Online Advertisements
This Site may carry advertisements from other companies. Some of these advertisements may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we know about your online activities over time and across different websites you may visit.
We also partner with third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf on other non-affiliated third party websites. Some of the ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on what we know about your online activities over time and across different websites you may visit.
