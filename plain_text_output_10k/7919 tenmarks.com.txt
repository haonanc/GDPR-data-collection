As a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., the information     we receive is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice at http://www.amazon.com/privacy (as supplemented by this policy).
We provide additional privacy safeguards to the students who use     our Programs, and we have signed the Student Privacy Pledge .

This policy describes our privacy practices for Student Information     we receive about a student's use of our Programs.  We use the term     "Student Information" in this policy to refer to information that     personally identifies a student and other information we receive     about a student that is linked to information that personally     identifies a student.  Student Information does not include     de-identified or aggregated information that does not personally     identify an individual student.
What Types of Student Information Does TenMarks Receive?
We receive Student Information for educational or school purposes,     or as authorized by an educator, parent, or student.  This includes,     for example, the following types of Student Information:
Student Information Provided by Educators or Parents: We receive information that an educator or parent gives us about     a student.  This may include, for example, a student's name or     identifier and grade level provided by an educator or parent when     they register a student for our Programs.  Student Information we     receive from a school or a district continues to be the property of     and under the control of the school or district.
Student Information Provided by Students: Student interactions with our Programs generate data we refer      to as "Performance Data."  Performance Data may include, for      example, the lessons a student chooses to play, when a student      starts and stops a lesson, and student responses in the lesson.
Student Information We Automatically Receive From the      Student's Device: We receive technical information      from the computer or mobile device a student uses to interact      with our Programs.  This technical information may include, for      example, the device operating system, web browser type, and      IP address.
How Does TenMarks Use the Student Information It Receives?
We use Student Information for educational or school purposes,     or as authorized by a parent or student.  In general, we use     Student Information to provide students the best possible educational     experience on our Programs. For example, we use Student Information:
To Customize and Personalize Our Programs: We      use Student Information to provide access to and to customize      and personalize our Programs.  For example, we may use a student's      Performance Data to adapt our Programs to a student's unique needs,      make adaptive learning recommendations, and to personalize the      reports and updates about a student's progress we send to educators      and parents.
To Assess Student Performance: We use Student      Information to assess student performance and provide updates      and reports about a student's progress to educators and parents.       For example, we may group Performance Data of similar students      to assess performance by level.
To Support, Provide, and Improve Our Programs and      Offerings: We use Student Information to support,      provide, and improve our Programs and offerings.  For example,      we may use Student Information to provide technical and customer      support.
Does TenMarks Share Student Information?
We do not sell Student Information to third parties.  We will share     Student Information only as described below.
Educational Institutions, Educators, and Parents: We provide educational institutions, educators, and parents with      progress reports, updates, and other information about their students.       These reports and updates may be personalized about an individual      student and may include Student Information.
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other      companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.       Examples include analyzing data and providing customer service.       They may have access to Student Information needed to perform their      functions, but may not use it for any other purposes.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our      business, we might merge with other businesses or sell substantially      all of our assets.  In such transactions, Student Information would      be one of the transferred business assets, but will remain subject      to the promises made in this policy.
Protection of TenMarks and Others: We release      Student Information when we believe release is appropriate to      comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other      agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of TenMarks,      our customers, or others.
Affiliated Businesses: To provide you the best      possible educational experience, we may work closely with Amazon.com,      Inc. and the subsidiaries it controls.  We may share Student      Information with these affiliated businesses, but their use of      the Student Information will be subject to the restrictions of      this policy.
As Authorized: We may share Student Information      with additional third parties for authorized educational or      school purposes, or as authorized by the educator, parent,      or by the student as permitted by applicable laws and regulations.
Can a Student, Educator, or Parent Opt-Out of Providing Student Information?
Our Programs are individualized and customized for each student, so the     Student Information we receive is required for a student to use our     Programs.  At any time, a student, educator, or parent may revoke consent     to allowing a student to use our Programs.  At a student's, educator's,     or parent's request, we will remove, de-identify, or anonymize the Student     Information in our Programs, and the student will no longer be able to     use our Programs.
Is TenMarks Compliant with FERPA?
Yes, our Programs allow customers to comply with FERPA.  For more information,    please see our Terms of Use .
Additional Frequently Asked Questions Related to Student Data Privacy
Can a student retain control of any student-generated content, including    transferring it to a personal account?
Yes, students using TenMarks Writing may download the final version of student-generated    essays.  TenMarks Math does not involve the creation of student-generated content.
Can parents, legal guardians, or students review Student Information in the    student's records and correct erroneous information?
A parent, legal guardian, or student may review Student Information in the    applicable student's records by viewing their TenMarks account.  To correct any    erroneous information, the parent, legal guardian, or student can ask the applicable    student's teacher or TenMarks customer support to make the changes.
What does TenMarks do to ensure the security and confidentiality of    Student Information?
We take a number of steps to protect the security and confidentiality of    Student Information.  We leverage industry-standard software, encryption, and the    leading infrastructure of Amazon Web Services to ensure the security of that information.     All team members with access to Student Information are required to take regular    training on their responsibilities in protecting that information against technical    and social engineering threats.  Access to sensitive Student Information is provided    only to employees with a business need, and is immediately removed upon the    termination of the employee.
What does TenMarks do if there is an unauthorized disclosure of Student    Information?
Within 48 hours of learning about a data breach, or longer reasonable time    as may be required by the legitimate needs of applicable law enforcement or as    to take measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore    reasonable integrity of its systems, TenMarks will notify all teachers, parents,    principals, and district administrators whose information may have been improperly    disclosed, via email communication to the email address on file for each user.     Since TenMarks does not maintain any contact information for students, TenMarks    will inform any users who oversee those students (i.e. relevant teachers, parents,    principals, and district administrators) if any Student Information is involved.     This email notification will describe the nature of the data breach and steps    that are being taken to protect their TenMarks accounts going forward.
Can a school, district or teacher request that TenMarks delete Student    Information?
Yes.  Following the termination of a license, a school or district may    request that TenMarks delete or de-identify Student Information and TenMarks    will do so.  A teacher who purchases a TenMarks license may also request    that TenMarks delete or de-identify Student Information after termination    of that license.
