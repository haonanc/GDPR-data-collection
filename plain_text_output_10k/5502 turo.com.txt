Turo Inc. (hereinafter, “Turo”, “we”, or “us”) cares about privacy and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use, process and disclose your information. This Privacy Policy covers your access or use of our websites and applications (“Platform”), when communicating with us or other Turo users on any device (collectively “Services”), or when you otherwise provide us with information. Turo Inc. acts as the data controller for the purpose of this Privacy Policy.
We collect three categories of information - information you give us; information automatically collected from your use of the Services; and information from third party sources.
Information you give us
Account information. When you register for an account with us, we require certain identifying information such as your name and email address.
Profile information. We may also ask you to provide additional profile information to use certain features of the Turo Service which may include street addresses, phone numbers, driver’s license number and issuing country and/or state and date of birth.  Certain parts of your profile (like your profile photos, employer, city, school and biography) are part of your public profile page and will be publicly visible to others.
Trip information. We collect information you provide in relation to a trip such as vehicle listing details, availability dates, reviews and uploaded trip photos.
Payment information. We collect your financial information (like your bank account or payment card numbers) in connection with a potential or actual transaction, which may be stored by one or more third party payment services providers or digital payments companies that may be located inside or outside of your country of residence including outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
Authentication information. In some instances, we may ask you to provide us a photograph and/or other demographic information, such as a scanned copy of a driver’s license, passport, or credit/debit card, last four digits of your Social Security number, social insurance number, social media account information, driver’s/motor vehicle record, insurance information, and other forms of identification. Where we request that you withhold certain information when providing us with personally identifiable information (such as obscuring or redacting all but the last four digits of your payment card number), please do so.
Communications with Turo and Turo users. When you communicate with Turo, whether via phone, email or chat, or use the Services to communicate with other users, we collect information about your communication and any information you choose to provide.
Information we automatically collect when you use or access our Services.
Usage data. We collect information about your interactions with the Platform, such as the pages or other content you view, your searches, bookings you have made and other actions on the Platform.
Location information. When you use certain features of the Platform, including if you opt in to use our Location Sharing feature, we may collect information about your location (e.g., IP address) or more specific location information (e.g., more precise location information from your mobile device).  Keep in mind that most mobile devices allow you to control or disable the use of location services by any application on your mobile device in the device’s settings menu.
Log data. We automatically collect log information when you use the Platform, even if you have not created a Turo account or logged in.  That information includes, among other things: details about how you’ve used the Platform, IP address, length of stay, frequency of visits, hardware and software information, device information, device event information (e.g., crashes, browser type) and the page you’ve viewed or engaged with before [or after] you’ve used the Platform.
Trip information. We collect information related to your transactions on the Platform, including the date and time, amounts charged and other related trip details.
Cookies and similar technology. When you access our Platform, we (including companies we work with) may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, clear gifs, pixel tags, e-tags, “Flash cookies”, or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications (collectively “Cookies”).  For more detailed information on our use of these technologies, please see our policy on Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies.  At this time, we do not respond to browser ‘Do-Not-Track’ signals.
Information we collect from third party sources.
Third party services. If you choose to log in to our Services through social media sites (e.g., Facebook or Google), the third-party service may send us information such as your registration and profile information from that service. The information we may receive varies by site and is controlled by that site. By associating an account managed by a third party with your Turo account and authorizing Turo to have access to this information, you agree that Turo may collect, store, and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for how those third parties use and share your information. Please refer to those third parties’ privacy policies to understand how they use and share your information.
In-vehicle devices. If your vehicle, or a vehicle you book through the Services, includes an in-car device operated by a third-party service or installed by the host, that host or service may record information about your use of the car. The host and third-party service will be solely responsible to you for its use of such information but may disclose such information to Turo.
Background information. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, Turo may obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or local versions of background or registered sex offenders checks.  We may use your information, including your full name and date of birth, to obtain such reports.
Other sources. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, fraud detection information or data from credit bureaus from third party service providers and/or partners and combine it with information we have about you.

Disclosure

You may direct us to share your information or consent to it as described at the time of sharing, such as when you authorize us to send to a third party marketing partner.
Profiles, listings and other public information
Your public listing page will always include some basic information, such as your user ID/name associated with your account, your public profile photo, and for hosts, the city where your car is located, your listing description, your calendar availability, transaction related information to allow our community to evaluate your reliability and responsiveness, and reviews/feedback. Your public listing page may also include aggregate demand information (such as number of page views over a period of time) and information about your cancellations. Our Services may also display the approximate geographic pick-up location on a map of the owner’s vehicle.
Our Services allow your public profile and public listing pages to be included in search engines, in which case your public profile and public Listing pages may be indexed by search engines and may be published as search results.
Sharing between hosts and guests
Turo enables car owners to offer and share their vehicles with other individuals. If you agree to a booking through the Services, we may provide your information to the other party in that transaction as reasonably necessary to facilitate the transaction. For example, Turo may provide your mobile phone number and/or driver’s license information to facilitate communication or your photograph to facilitate identification. We will provide the address of the vehicle and/or the proposed delivery location. We may also share user-uploaded “Trip Photos” with captions with the other party involved in the reservation if that feature is selected. Turo users engaged in a booking with you may send you text message (such as to confirm pickup or delivery location). Standard telephone minute and text and data charges may apply.
Service providers
We may share Information with vendors and service providers who are engaged by, or working with, us in connection with the processing of payments, operation of our Services and customer support functions and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. In some cases, the service provider may be directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. These service providers may be located inside or outside your country of residence, including outside the EEA.  For hosts who choose to use our photography program, your contact information will be shared with the photographer assigned to shoot your vehicle.  These providers have limited access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated to use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
Aggregated data
Turo may compile aggregate information about the use of the Services. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Services. Turo may also share aggregate demographic information with advertisers and partners. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information that does not identify any individual.
Corporate family
We may disclose your information to other members of the Turo corporate family or to third parties, who may or may not be in the EEA, including our insurance and claims providers, as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence to provide insurance and claims services; to comply with legal process; to respond to requests from public and government authorities including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; to enforce our Terms of Service and related Policies; to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates or users; to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we or our users may sustain.

Security
We have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect information against unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration while it is under our control.
