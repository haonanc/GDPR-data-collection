Foreword
There is nothing more important than privacy. Therefore, we encrypt all IP-addresses used in votings before storing them into the database. Anyhow, for crime prosecution, we save the IP-adress of the creator of a poll in plain-text. This is not a place to commit crimes, bully others or spread propaganda. Please think twice before putting personal data into the poll title or answer options, since you are responsible for that.
