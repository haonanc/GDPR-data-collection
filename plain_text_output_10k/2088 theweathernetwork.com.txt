Pelmorex Corp. (our, us or we) operates the Websites www.theweathernetwork.com and http://www.meteomedia.com (collectively the Websites), the television program The Weather Network and related services and applications (collectively the “Services”). This Privacy Policy describes how we may collect, use and disclose personal information in relation to the Services, which you consent to by accessing the Services. “Personal information” means information about an identifiable individual but does not include business information.
This Privacy Policy may be supplemented or modified by consents you provide to Pelmorex, and by agreements you enter into with Pelmorex from time to time. To learn more about how we and third parties may process personal information for interest based advertising, and to opt out of such uses, please read below.
Our collection, use and disclosure of personal information
In most cases, we collect personal information directly from you when you purchase, register for or interact with us about the Services. In some cases, it may be optional for you to create an account, or consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information, in order to access our Services across various platforms. In some cases, we may collect personal information from a third party with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law. We will typically identify to you the purposes for which we may collect, use and disclose your personal information at the time that we collect such information. In general terms, such purposes include:
To deliver Services to you which you have requested or signed up for;
To establish and manage your subscriptions and accounts with us;
To respond to your requests, questions and inquiries;
To advise you of information, products and services which may be of interest to you;
To deliver relevant advertising as described herein;
To enforce and administer the terms of use of the Websites and Services; and
To meet our legal obligations and as permitted by law.
We may share information with related organizations and third party service providers for the purpose of providing the Services and as described in this Privacy Policy (including the provision of products and services offered in conjunction with the Services). Where such parties are located outside of Canada, your personal information will be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction, including laws related to the disclosure of personal information to the authorities in that jurisdiction.
Below we describe in more detail how we collect, use and disclose information for certain Services.
Automatically Collected Information
Some information concerning your use of the Services will be collected automatically as you use them, for example:
Internet Protocol ("IP") address used to connect your computer to the Internet;
Computer, device and connection information, such as browser type and version, operating system, mobile platform and unique device identifier (“UDID”) and other technical identifiers;
Location information for location-aware Services to provide you with more relevant content for where you are in the world.
We collect and use this information to generate aggregate/non-identifiable information in order to further develop, provide and manage the Services.
Subscriptions
When you sign up for a Subscription (e.g. weather forecasts, pollen forecasts, alerts and other information delivered by e-mail), you are required to provide your name, e-mail address and password. This information is used to deliver weather forecasts to your e-mail address, contact you and administer your Subscription, and enable you to log in to manage your subscription.
We may also ask for additional, optional, information, which is not required to participate in the Subscription service. Such information may include your gender and year of birth. We collect and use this information in order to gain a better understanding of our subscribers to improve our Services, and to generate aggregate/non-identifiable demographic information which is shared with third party advertisers to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. To opt out of such use, please do not provide the optional information, or you may contact our Privacy Officer at any time as indicated below.
Weather Widgets
When you sign up to obtain a Weather Widget, we will request your name, e-mail address, company name (if available) and website URL. We use this information to contact you to communicate changes in the Weather Widget Service, as well as to keep a record of what websites the Weather Widget is posted on.
Posting photos and videos
When you sign up to upload images or videos to our Services, we will request your name, e-mail address, password and postal code. By signing up, providing this information and uploading photos or videos, you agree that Pelmorex Corp. may publish your photos and videos on the Websites, on television, and otherwise in the Services, including with your name and location (e.g. city, town, or region, based on postal code). We may also use your email address to contact you to notify you if your picture or video is chosen to be displayed on any of the Services.
Applications (‘apps’) and location information
When you download our location-enabled apps (e.g. Follow Me, which provides localized weather information based on the location of your device), you will normally be prompted to either permit or deny the app to use location information from your device. This choice can be changed later on in your device settings. If you deny permission for the app to use location services, the portions of the app that rely on location information will not function. If you permit the app to use location services, we may periodically collect information about the location of your device, which may include times when you are not directly interacting with the application. We may use this information to customize content and the Services, including public safety alerts and personalized notifications, to allow us to adapt the Services to your needs, to research the effectiveness of our network and to develop new features and Services. In addition, we may share non-identified location information with third parties for advertising use.
Mobile device identifiers
A mobile device identifier is an anonymous identifier of your cell phone. The identifier information is sent back to Pelmorex Corp. along with other data such as the precise location of your phone if you have enabled location information in the app as you use our app or browse the web. The data does not identify you personally. We may share non-identified identifiers with third parties for advertising use, analytics, to ensure you receive a better consumer experience, in order to better understand our users in general and to guide our product improvements.
You can limit the range of data that your phone sends to us by disabling the identifier on your mobile device. This will not affect how your device operates. Details about mobile device identifiers and how to disable/reset the identifier for your specific device can be found at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074 and http://www.ghacks.net/2015/04/20/how-to-reset-your-advertising-id-on-android/ .
API or SDKs
APIs (application programming interfaces) and SDKs (software development kits) which may be embedded in our app by one of our partners provide geo-fencing capabilities, mobile analytics and the ability to deliver push messaging. When you access the app an API/SDK may collect non-personally identifiable data related to the device such as the device ID, model and operating system, information about the API or SDK being used and data related to you such as latitude and longitude location information and self-reported data provided when you downloaded the app if you provided the information. This information does not identify you personally. The information may be collected for advertising use, to ensure you receive a better consumer experience, analytics, guide our product improvements and market research.
Bluetooth (Proximity) Beacons
Bluetooth beacons are devices that emit low-powered signals that have been set up in stores, museums, airports and other public spaces which can be detected by your mobile device when you enable Bluetooth and you utilize any app that you have downloaded and given permission to use your phone’s Bluetooth and location. When you grant permission in our app to enable location tracking we may collect data from physical proximity beacons located in or near public spaces where you are located at that point in time. As such, we may collect data about your location and other contextual data when you are near a beacon. If your device preferences allow us or our app access to location services, we may collect information about the location of your device in the store including data from each of our partners' beacons with which you interact, and we may segment you collectively with other users and utilize it for content/advertising as well as share the segments with third parties. The information we collect does not identify you personally. You may disable the communication of these beacons with your mobile device by disabling Bluetooth or modifying your preferences for location services for our app.
