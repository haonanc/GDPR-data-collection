from third parties, for example, other Applications controlled by us or our affiliates, our business partners or other third parties.
All information we collect on the Applications is subject to this Privacy Policy. By using the Applications, you consent to all actions taken by us with respect to your information in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
Information You Provide To Us
The information we collect on or through our Applications may include:
Information that you provide by filling in forms on our Applications. This includes information provided at the time of registering to use our Applications, subscribing to our service, posting material on message boards or requesting further services. We may also ask you for information when you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, and when you report a problem with our Applications.
Records and copies of your correspondence (including e-mail addresses), if you contact us.
Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.
Details of transactions, if any, you may carry out through our Applications and of the fulfillment of your orders. You may be required to provide financial information before placing an order through our Applications.
We may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us. If you use our Applications to send others information that may interest them or messages through our system, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient. Similarly, if you use our Applications to upload, share or distribute content (including videos, comments or other submissions), and such content contains personal information about others, such information may be stored in order to allow for such uploading, sharing or distribution.
When you access our Applications from a mobile device like a tablet or phone, we may receive information about your location, your device, including one or more unique identifiers for your device, and your mobile carrier. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most devices allow you to turn off location services.
You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, "posted") on public areas of the Applications, or transmitted to other users of the Applications or third parties (collectively, "User Contributions"). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. Although, we may limit access to certain pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Applications with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
Information We May Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies
As you navigate through and interact with our Applications, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns, including:
details of your visits to our Applications, including any form of aggregate data, navigational data, tracking data, location data, click-stream data, or historical data, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Applications, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information, log files and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Applications; and
information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system and browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us. An IP, or "Internet Protocol", address is a unique number associated with your computer that may be communicated to other computers and servers when you use the Internet. The information collected may include the domain name of your internet service provider, referral data (e.g., the address of the last page you visited prior to clicking through to the Applications and the address of the exit page when you left our Applications) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Firefox browser on a Macintosh platform). We use this information to track how users are accessing and using the Applications.
We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party Applications or other online services (behavioral tracking). See " Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information " below for information on how you can opt out of behavioral tracking on this Applications and how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise choice about behavioral tracking.
The information we collect automatically is statistical data and may include personal information, or we may maintain it or associate it with personal information we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. It helps us to improve our Applications and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:
estimate our audience size and usage patterns;
store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Applications according to your individual interests;
speed up your searches; and
recognize you when you return to our Applications.
The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:
Cookies (or browser cookies). Cookies are small text files that are stored in your web browser or downloaded to your device when you visit an Application. Cookies are then sent back to the originating Applications on each subsequent visit, or to another Applications that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow an Application to recognize a user’s device. Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (i) to enable certain functions; (ii) to provide analytics; (iii) to store your preferences; and (iv) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.
We currently use the following types of cookies
Cookies that are strictly necessary: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Applications. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log into the members’ area of our Applications and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular service or content.
Analytical cookies: These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of users and to see how users use and explore our Applications. These cookies help us to improve our Applications, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily.
Functionality cookies: We are always glad to see you back. This type of cookies allows us to recognize you when you return to our Applications in order to greet you by name and to remember, for example, your choice of language.
Targeting cookies: These cookies record the visit of a user on our Applications, the pages a user has visited and the links a user has followed in order to enable us to make our Applications more relevant to the users’ interests. In addition, these cookies are used to identify the Applications and the marketing materials you are accessing our Applications from in order to target content (for example, to automatically show you our Applications according to your language settings).
We do not require that you accept cookies and you may withdraw your consent to our use of cookies at any time by adjusting your browser’s privacy settings. However, if you decline to accept cookies, some functionality on our Applications may be disabled and you may be unable to access certain parts of our Applications. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Applications. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years.
Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Applications may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from and on our Applications. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. For information about managing your privacy and security settings for Flash cookies, see " Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information ".
Web Beacons. Pages of the Applications and our e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in an email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns and for other related Applications statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain Applications content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party Applications.
Device identifiers. When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Applications, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, or remotely store one or more "device identifiers". Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the Applications. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Applications and may help others or us provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Applications may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled..
Metadata. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Contributions. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Contribution was collected and how that content is formatted. Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Contribution including a hashtag, comments or other data. This makes your User Contribution more searchable by others and more interactive.
Analytics Tools. We use analytics tools and other third party technologies, such as Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies, to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics when you use our Applications. These tools and technologies collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device identifiers, and other similar information. The third party analytics companies who collect information on our Applications and other online products or services may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other Applications or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of Applications as well as online or mobile products and services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. In addition to our use of technologies as described herein, we may permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you based on your use of our Applications and to otherwise collect and use data about your use of our Applications. For more information about this practice, please see the " Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies " section below.
The information generated by Google Analytics and DoubleClick Cookies about your use of the Applications (including your IP address) may be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate / anonymize the last octet of a particular IP address. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Applications, compiling reports on Applications’ activity and providing other services relating to Applications’ activity and internet usage to the Applications. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser or your device. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Applications.
You may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page or you may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page .
By downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en , you can permanently opt out of the DoubleClick cookie. The plugin lets you keep your opt-out status even when you clear all cookies.
Please note that on these Applications, for some countries Google Analytics code may be supplemented by "gat._anonymizeIp();" to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called IP-masking).
Third-party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Applications are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Applications. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different Applications and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.
We do not control these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see " Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information ".
Collection and Sharing of Location Information: In addition to other information described in this policy, we may collect and share precise location information, through methods such as mobile "SDKs" (mobile technologies that operate similar to web-based "cookies").   This location information may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with mobile identifiers (such as IDFAs and Android IDs), and shared with Cuebiq Inc., for purposes related to advertising, analytics, attribution (e.g., measuring ad performance), analytics and research.    You can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device. (Certain services may lose functionality as a result.)  You can "opt out" of various third party uses Apple’s and Android’s advertising identifiers through device settings, as well.

How We Store Your Information
The information that we collect about you, including personal information, may be stored and processed in any country in which we, our affiliates or service providers maintain facilities.
We may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

We use commercially reasonable safeguards (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard the information that we collect about you from unauthorized access and disclosure secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. Furthermore, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
We want you to feel confident using our Applications. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure.
Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us.
You can choose not to provide us with certain personal information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Applications because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Applications.
You may, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at the email address provided at the end of this privacy policy.

How We Protect Your Personal Information
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Applications, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Applications like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Applications.
We want you to feel confident using our Applications. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications would always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Applications.
User Contributions
We may provide areas on our Applications where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others, upload content (e.g., pictures, videos, audio files, etc.), and post comments or reviews of content found on the Applications.

In addition, such postings may appear on other applications or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. If you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. To request removal of your personal information from our blog, sharing service or community forum, for example, send us an e-mail at support@mirmay.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
Accessing and Correcting Your Information
You may, at any time, send us an e-mail at support@mirmay.com to request access to, correct or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us, except personal information or data that is necessary for administration purposes or for fraud prevention measures. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
If you delete your User Contributions from the Applications, copies of your User Contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other Applications’ users.
Financial Information
Any financial data that you have provided to us will only be shared with the Applications’ third party processors in order to initiate and complete any orders placed on your account. All credit card transactions and such are processed with industry standard encryption through third party processors who only use your information for that purpose. All financial data and information shall be considered private information and will not be shared by the Applications with third parties except with your authorization or when necessary to carry out all and any transactions requested by the user with the understanding that such transactions may be subject to rules, terms, conditions and policies of a third party. All such information provided to a third party and all transactions are not governed by this privacy policy. All such information provided to a third party is subject to their terms and conditions.
Third Party Login Functionality
We may permit users with accounts on certain third party services, including but not limited to, social networking, search, sharing, and other services delivered by third parties, to bypass the standard applicable registration process. If you connect through an authorized third party service, you will be able to use your third party login information to log in to your account or access our content and Applications. We are not responsible for the sharing, posting, commenting, or other content and information gathering practices of any third party services that may be triggered by using these third party login services. Please review their terms of service and privacy policies carefully before using third party login functionality to access our Applications.
By using any third party services to log in to your account or access our Applications, you permit us to access, store and use all information related to your third party account that may be accessible to us through the third party service, including through its application programming interface (API), pursuant to this privacy policy.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may modify or revise our privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this privacy policy, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at http://www.mirmay.com/privacy.html , so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.
If we change anything in our privacy policy, the date of change will be reflected in the "last modified date". You agree that you will periodically review this privacy policy and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision to our privacy policy. If the "last modified" date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed our privacy policy, then it is unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review our privacy policy, and you agree to the new ones.
All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Applications thereafter. The updated version of our privacy policy supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. By continuing to use the Applications subsequent to us making available an amended version of our privacy policy, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.
Enforcement
We regularly review our compliance with this privacy policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or our treatment of personal information by contacting us at support@mirmay.com . When we receive a formal written complaint, it is our policy to contact the complaining party regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved by an individual and us.
No Rights of Third Parties
This privacy policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the Applications.
Our Policy Towards Children
Our Applications are not directed to children under 13 years of age. If you become aware that your child under 13 years of age has provided us with personal information, please contact us at support@mirmay.com .
