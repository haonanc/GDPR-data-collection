Privacy Policy
Cable ONE recognizes its responsibility to help protect personally identifiable information collected about visitors to the                                     Cable ONE website. This Privacy Policy describes the personally identifiable information                                     we collect online and how we use and protect this information. In this document, "Cable One"                                     means Cable One, Inc. and any Cable One affiliate or subsidiary authorized to provide you                                     with services. Specifically, Cable One affiliates or subsidiaries include Cable One VoIP                                     LLC.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
We collect personally identifiable information when you complete online forms on this website.                                     The types of personally identifiable information that we collect include: first and last                                     name; home and e-mail addresses; and telephone number. We may also collect additional personally                                     identifiable information if you choose to respond to a voluntary customer survey or enter                                     a sweepstakes or contest offered through this site, or if you request changes to your service                                     through one of our customer service representatives. We also will collect your e-mail address                                     if you choose to ask a question or provide feedback online.
We also may collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit this website. When you access the Cable ONE Internet                                     portal page or other Cable ONE websites, Cable ONE and its affiliates, partners and advertisers                                     may place small text files or "cookies" on your computer's hard drive. These cookies, which                                     store only the zip code you have entered, provide information about your activities on our                                     site so that we may provide you with customized content and facilitate your use of the site.                                     Third parties, including our affiliates, partners, and advertisers, may also place cookies                                     on your computer. These cookies collect anonymous information in order to provide information                                     about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Accepting all cookies is voluntary,                                     and you may still use this site if you decline our cookies - although you may not be able                                     to access certain services that we offer. You can also manually delete cookies once they                                     are placed onto your computer. Consult your web browser for instructions on how to decline                                     and/or delete cookies.
We may also collect information about your interests when you choose to click on links in commercial e-mail messages that                                     we send you. Cable ONE does not collect any information that you provide when you visit a                                     particular website; we simply seek to understand the links that you found of interest in                                     our commercial e-mail messages so that we can send you information that may be of interest.                                     Cable ONE also does not collect personally identifiable information through this process                                     unless you voluntarily provide it (such as through a sweepstakes entry form), and you can                                     choose not to receive any commercial e-mail messages we send through opt-out links that are                                     provided in every such message.
Cable ONE does not routinely monitor the activity of user accounts except for measurements of system utilization, general                                     statistical analyses and the preparation of billing records and logs which result in the                                     gathering of minimal personally identifiable information, including names and e-mail addresses                                     of visitors to this website.
Use of Personally Identifiable Information
We use the personally identifiable information we collect to make sure you receive the products and services you requested;                                     to send your bills and credit you for payments; to respond promptly to your questions, complaints,                                     and requests for changes in service; to help resolve any service or maintenance problems;                                     to protect the security of our equipment and services; to ensure compliance with applicable                                     laws; to prevent the unauthorized reception of service; and to investigate activity that                                     violates our Terms and Conditions. We may also use your personally identifiable information                                     to send you program or service listings, new product or service offerings, special announcements,                                     and other information we think you may want on behalf of Cable ONE or third parties. We do                                     not disclose any of your personally identifiable information when we send you information                                     on behalf of third parties, and you can always choose to opt out of receiving commercial                                     e- mail announcements that we send about our own products or services or those of third parties                                     by clicking on the opt-out link provided in every such e-mail communication.
Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information
Cable ONE will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for purposes unrelated to those for                                     which the information was collected without your permission except to respond to proper requests                                     for information from government or judicial officials investigating illegal activity, in                                     the event of bankruptcy or a sale of substantially all or some of the assets of Cable ONE,                                     to protect the personal safety of its subscribers or the public, to protect and defend the                                     rights or property of Cable ONE or our subscribers, or to otherwise comply with the law.                                     Cable ONE may share your personally identifiable information with entities affiliated with                                     us through common ownership or control.
Right To Review and Update Personally Identifiable Information
We will maintain personally identifiable information about you only so long as it is necessary for the purpose for which                                     it was collected or to comply with laws governing our business. This period of time could                                     be as long as seven years for our tax and accounting needs. Thereafter such information will                                     be destroyed unless there are legitimate pending requests for access to such information.
Security of Personally Identifiable Information
The security of your personally identifiable information is a high priority for us. While no website can guarantee security,                                     we employ security technologies and procedures to help protect the confidentiality of your                                     personally identifiable information.
Children's Privacy
Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under thirteen years of age. If, as a part of future service offerings, we decide to request                                     personally identifiable information from children under thirteen, we will require verifiable                                     parental consent before we collect this information as required by applicable law. Should                                     a child whom we know to be under thirteen send personal information to us, we will use that                                     information only to respond to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental                                     consent before receiving his or her personal information.
Third-Party Websites
There are several places throughout our website where you may accept a link to other websites that do not operate under our                                     privacy practices. When you click through to these websites, our privacy policies and practices                                     no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of all third-party websites                                     before engaging in any transactions with them to understand their procedures for collecting,                                     using, and disclosing your information.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may modify or update our services from time to time, and if necessary, the provisions of this privacy statement. In the                                     case of material changes to our privacy practices, we will post changes to our privacy policy                                     here for a period of time before such changes become effective.

Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”)
Another aspect of Cable ONE’s privacy policy relates exclusively to phone information. Federal regulations require that a                                     company providing voice services inform its customers regarding specific protections it establishes                                     for information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location,                                     and amount of a service used by customers as well as other information contained in the phone                                     bill pertaining to the service received by the customer such as charges and account number.                                     This information when associated with a particular customer is known as “Customer Proprietary                                     Network Information” or “CPNI”. It does not include names, addresses and telephone numbers                                     (unless unlisted) because such information is generally publicly available. In addition,                                     it does not include aggregate information of many customers so long as it does not identify                                     any particular customer.
In order to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI, we have instituted the following procedures. We follow security practices                                     that are standard in the industry. We have in place technical responses to resist brute force                                     attacks on our servers as well as other outside attacks on the security of our data. We have                                     taken steps to secure the physical location of our data from all outsiders as well as non-authorized                                     individuals within Cable ONE. Policies in place impose restrictions on the use and disclosure                                     of customer information, and training is in place to disseminate these policies and refresh                                     them. Of course, no amount of prudent and careful security measures can completely guarantee                                     that every unauthorized attempt to access CPNI will be driven back.
To add another layer of protection, we will not disclose your CPNI to anyone outside of Cable ONE without your consent. This                                     includes company affiliates, unless you are also a customer of that affiliate. If we receive                                     a call from someone purporting to be you, we will not release your CPNI over the phone but                                     will require the caller to make the request in person at a local Cable ONE office in order                                     to confirm identity. If you are a Cable ONE Internet customer, you may access your CPNI online                                     with a user ID and password. If you call to discuss your own CPNI, we will review it with                                     you but we will not discuss any of your protected information that you do not reveal to us.
We may use or disclose your CPNI without your permission for limited reasons such as to provide necessary services and support                                     such as maintenance and billing for the phone service you currently have as well as market                                     new or additional adjunct offerings for the phone service you currently have such as call                                     blocking and caller ID. We may also disclose your CPNI in response to a proper legal demand                                     for the information and to protect Cable ONE, its customers or other parties against fraudulent,                                     abusive or unlawful use of its services.
While the rules regarding CPNI prohibit the use of CPNI in marketing campaigns without your consent, we have elected not                                     to use CPNI for marketing. Should that decision change, we will notify you and provide you                                     with the opportunity to grant or deny consent to our use of your CPNI in our marketing campaigns.
Do Not Call Policy
As part of its general business practice and in compliance with laws and regulations governing telemarketing and consumers’ rights to privacy, Cable ONE has instituted the following Do Not Call policy.
It is the policy of Cable ONE that outbound sales calls will not be made to any person who has communicated a desire to us                                     not to receive telephone solicitations or to any person who is on a state or federal Do Not                                     Call list, except as permitted by law. The company reserves the right to make telephone solicitations                                     in the absence of notification.
Cable ONE maintains a record of the name and telephone number(s) for consumers who do not wish to be called or contacted.                                     Cable ONE and its agents use this internal list as well as the National Do Not Call list and relevant state Do Not Call lists to prevent calls to individuals on these lists. At least                                     quarterly, Cable ONE or its telemarketing agents check and update the internal list against                                     all relevant state and federal Do Not Call registries.
You may contact your local Cable ONE office, either by phone or in writing, to request to be added to our Do Not Call list.                                     Whether you call or write, you must specifically request to be placed on Cable ONE’s Do Not                                     Call list and provide your name, address and all telephone number(s) you wish to be included                                     in the list. Your number will be placed on our Do Not Call list within five (5) days of receipt.
Please notify us if there are any changes to your telephone number during that time. If you obtain a new telephone number,                                     you must give us that new number if you want your “do not call” status to remain in effect.
Please note that the law permits Cable ONE to contact its customers for non-solicitation purposes, such as surveys, billing                                     issues or service-related matters.
Customers may request a copy of this Policy by contacting their local Cable ONE system.
