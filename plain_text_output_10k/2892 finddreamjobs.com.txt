“Sites”), created, owned and operated by Search Works Media, LLC (“us” or “we”)
and is applicable to all information about you (“you or “your”) collected
through a Site.  All references in this Policy to the Site includes future jobs
listings related Sites that we and our Affiliates (defined below) may create,
own and/or operate.
This Policy describes the types of
information that we gather from you and the other people who visit the Site
(“Users”), how we may use that information and how you can contact us
regarding this Policy and your personal information. This Policy also describes
additional rights that California Users have under the California “Shine the
Light” law.   
Please read this entire Policy
carefully before using the Site or providing us with any information that is
personally identifiable to a User (PII) and information that is not personally
identifiable to a User (non-PII)(together, “Information”). When you access or
use the Site, you consent to the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of
your Information in accordance with this Policy by us, our third party
marketing partners, and our parent, subsidiaries and entities under common
control with us (“Affiliates”).  If you do not agree to the terms of this
Policy, you are not authorized to use the Site.
 
the Types Collected
We and our marketing partners and
Affiliates collect Information in a number of different ways.  We collect
Information when a User registers on our Site and provides us identifying PII
such as their name, email, address, date of birth and gender.  We also use
technological means to collect Information about a User such as the type of
device and browser they are using, where they were browsing before they arrived
at our Site, their IP address and if a User is on a mobile device, which carrier
they use.  This Information may be supplemented or verified by third party
services.
If you reached the Site by clicking
on a link or an ad from another website or from an email sent from one of our
marketing partners, then we may also capture that information to understand the
interests of our Users and to keep track of third parties who direct Users to
our Sites.  Users may supply information through our dynamically determined
survey questions which we then associate with the User’s PII to help us identify
the products and services they may be interested in.   We track and record a
User’s behavior while on our Site and associate it with the User’s PII so that
if a User returns to our Site, we can, for example, avoid showing the User the
same offers or asking the same survey questions.   
 
In order for a User to take full
advantage of the Site, we ask Users to voluntarily provide their PII to us. If
a User chooses not to provide us with their PII by simply not entering it on
the Site or not otherwise providing it to us, the User will not be able to
 
We currently do not use technologies
such as “cookies” (small text files placed/dropped on a User’s device), “web
beacons” (single-pixel GIF files) or similar technologies to track the User’s
online behavior and interaction with the Site.  We may permit third parties to

·       
web-based programs or applications on the Site.
 
Behavioral advertising enables us and
our marketing partners and Affiliates to deliver to users what is hoped to be
more relevant information and offers for products or services.  We track online
behavior principally by a User’s email address while our third party marketing
partners and Affiliates may use cookies, web beacons and other technological
means to track users’ online behavior and to collect Information.  In either
case, identifying a User and their past online behavior enables the tailoring
of targeted offers and advertisements.  We may share this and other Information
with our third party marketing partners and Affiliates and may be compensated
for doing so. 
We may use Google Analytics and
similar tools provided by our third party partners to help analyze how Users
interact with the Site and display customized ads and other content to our
Users during a current browsing session or in the future when the User is
online. These analytics are performed by using the technological means
described above to monitor a User’s interactions with the Site and do not
involve the collection of any additional PII.
 
We and our Affiliates and marketing
partners may advertise and promote the Site and we may permit our marketing
partners to place ads and other content, including links to other websites, on
the Site.  While we try to post links only to third-party websites that share
our respect for privacy, this Policy and our privacy practices do not extend to
and may differ from those of third-party websites that can be accessed through links
on this Site.   You should review the applicable privacy policies of the
third-party websites before registering with, providing Information to or
navigating those websites.
 
The Site is intended to comply with
the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA requires that web
site operators never knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 13
without prior verifiable parental consent. The Site is not intended for
children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect or use PII from
children under the age of 18.  If we discover personal data from a child under
the age of 18, we will eliminate that data.

with the rules under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). If you
provide your express consent via your electronic signature for TCPA purposes,

State’s Do-Not-Call Registry, you expressly consent to; (a) receive
telemarketing calls, text (SMS) messages, and any other means of communication
that your wireless device may be capable of receiving (e.g. mms, video etc. )
from the persons named in the consent (including through the use of automated
dialing equipment); and (b) receive future information about products and
services from us, our marketing partners, Affiliates and other third parties to
whom we may provide your Information via other means such as email.  You may
revoke your consent to be contacted in this manner by any reasonable means at
any time (see the Opting-Out section below).

your consent to receive telemarketing calls.

third party marketing partners and would like to opt-out from future
communications from them, you must contact them directly.  In general, it takes
up to 10 days for an Opt-Out request to take effect.   A third party’s use of
Information is subject to their privacy policy.
 
Users may opt out from the collection of
online viewing data for behavioral advertising purposes by companies who have
elected to participate in one of the behavioral advertising opt-out mechanisms
such as the Digital Adverting Alliance’s opt-out program located at http://www.aboutads.info/choices or the Network Advertising Initiative at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .  As is the case with most websites, we have not elected
to participate in any of these programs at this time.  Users may also opt out
from the same type of data collection performed by Trade Desk, Inc., one of our

the collection of online viewing data for analytics purposes performed by
Google Analytics by going to Ad Settings under their Google account.  As noted

behavior but may identify you by your email address or other means and will use
these methods to tailor your experience on our Site if you visit our Site or
one of Affiliate’s sites in the future.

We use commercially reasonable efforts to
prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss or destruction of
your Information. We currently do not encrypt Information that we store except
for health related information.  Given the nature of the Internet, your

we cannot guarantee that our security measures or those of our Affiliates or
third parties who access or transmit your Information will prevent your

Most browsers contain a “do-not-track”
setting.  In general, when a “do-not-track” setting is active, the user’s
browser notifies other websites that the user does not want their personal
information and online behavior to be tracked and used, for example, for
behavioral advertising.  As required by recent Shine the Light law amendments,
we are required to inform you that, if your browser is set to do not track, our
Site will respond in accordance with that setting so that, for example, we will
not be able to access any cookies stored in your browser.  The impact a do not
track setting has on a website’s operation varies from browser to browser.  You
should be aware that we use other means to identify Users who have previously
visited our Site including their email address and we track a User’s online
behavior while on our Site.  We may use this information to tailor the User’s
experience should they visit our Site or sites belonging to our Affiliate in
the future.  Setting your browser to “do not track” will have no impact on
these practices.   
 
We reserve the right to revise and update
this Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will
post notice on our Site.  Any such revisions will be effective 30 days after
posting to the Site and will apply to all Information collected by us both
before and following the effective date. Your use of the Site following any
such revisions will be deemed your acceptance of such revisions. Users should
periodically visit this page to review our current policies on our collection
and use of Information.
