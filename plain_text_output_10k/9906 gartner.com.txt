3. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Gartner is a global company and, as such, we may transfer personal information to other Gartner group companies or suppliers outside your home jurisdiction. Gartner will take all reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is protected and any such transfers comply with applicable law.
Gartner may transfer and maintain the personal information of individuals covered by this Notice on servers or databases outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Some of these countries may not have the equivalent level of protection under their data protection laws as in the EEA.
The countries to which we transfer data outside of the EEA may include any of the countries in which Gartner does business. A list of Gartner office locations can be found here .
All Gartner entities have signed an Intragroup Agreement containing the European Union (“EU”) Commission Approved Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area. All Gartner entities have the same technical, physical, and administrative security controls and are required to comply with our data protection policies and procedures, applicable laws, and the terms of our client and member contracts governing the collection and use of information.
Privacy Shield.  Gartner, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary CEB Inc. comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of information from European Union and Switzerland to the United States, and is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. Gartner has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/ .
Gartner’s accountability for information that we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, we remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process the information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
4. RETENTION PERIODS
We will retain your personal information for as long as required to perform the purposes for which the data was collected, depending on the legal basis for which that data was obtained and/or whether additional legal/regulatory obligations mandate that we retain your personal information.  We may also retain personal information for the period during which a claim may be made in relation to our dealings with you.  
In general terms, this will mean that your personal data will be kept for the duration of our relationship with you and:
the period required by tax and company laws and regulations; and
as long as it is necessary for you to be able to bring a claim against us and for us to be able to defend ourselves against any legal claims. This will generally be the length of the relationship plus the length of any applicable statutory limitation period under local laws. 
5. CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION
We believe it is important to give you choices about the use of your information. We will use your information as described in this Policy (or any other event- or service-specific Privacy Policy). If we want to use your information for a purpose not described in this Policy, we will first get your consent to do so.

We will respect your wishes not to receive marketing communications. You can change your marketing preferences by contacting us at the address here . If you gave us your email address to receive marketing communications, you can opt out at any time by using the unsubscribe links or instructions included at the bottom of our emails. Please note that we will continue to send you service-related communications regardless of any opt-out request. We will not sell or share your information or information with third parties (other than our subsidiaries or affiliates) for their own promotional or marketing purposes unless you give us consent to do so and where permitted by applicable law.
Gartner Everywhere
Gartner Everywhere is an extension for Google Chrome that allows clients to customize their Gartner experience by providing them with Gartner research applicable to the websites they are browsing in real-time via an easy to access pop-up in their browser. You can easily disable the extension and its collection of URLs by doing the following: 
Click the extension Gartner Everywhere button on the top of the browser window.
Click the green toggle button to switch off.
Select the duration that you would like to switch off the extension for.
The extension will be automatically activated after the selected time period.
Events
When you attend one of our events, you will be issued an events badge with an RFID chip, which has a unique identifier that can be scanned from various distances. If you select an RFID-enabled badge, we may use it to track your location around our event sites so we can better understand your areas of interest. If you do not want us to track your location, you may obtain a non-RFID enabled badge by asking Events staff at the registration desk.
You may choose to share your contact details with our event sponsors by allowing them to scan your event badge. Our sponsors’ use of any information you choose to share with them in this way is governed by each sponsor’s Privacy Policy.

6. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
You have certain rights, in certain circumstances, in relation to your personal information. A summary of each right and how an individual can take steps to exercise it is set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details specified above for the Data Protection Officer. Such requests should include appropriate identity verification information (such as your name, address, email address or other information reasonably required).
Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we shall provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example where requests are complex or numerous.
The information will be provided free of charge, except where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character. In these circumstances we may charge a reasonable fee or may refuse to act on the request. We will advise you of any fees prior to proceeding with a request.
We may ask for additional information to verify your identity before carrying out a request.
Where we do not carry out a request, we shall inform you without delay and within one month of receipt of the request, providing our reasons for not taking the action requested.
Right
Right to access and/or correct your personal information
You have the right to access personal information we hold about you, as well as to be provided with a copy of the information (in most circumstances). You also have the right to correct any information we may hold about you that is inaccurate.
Right to restrict use of your personal information
You have the right to ask us to restrict processing of your personal data where one of the following applies:
The processing is unlawful but you want us to restrict use of the data instead of deleting it;
Where you contest the accuracy of your personal data, the restriction will apply until we have verified the accuracy or corrected your personal data;
We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still require us to keep it in connection with a legal claim;
You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.
Right to request deletion of your personal information
You have the right to ask us to delete your personal information in certain circumstances. Please note that if you want us to refrain from sending you marketing communications, the best way to ensure that is to allow us to retain your information with a “do not contact” tag so we know not to contact you in the future.
There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required to comply with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Right to object to processing of your personal information
You may object to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes.
You may also object to processing of your personal data in cases where we have used legitimate interests as the basis for processing. In such cases, we will stop processing your personal data until we verify that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms in asking us to stop processing the data, or in limited cases where we need to continue processing the data for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
Right to data portability 
In most cases, you have the right to receive all personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this data to another data controller, where technically feasible.
Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
If you object to our processing of your personal data, you have the right to complain to the data protection authority (“DPA”) in the country where you reside, where you work, or where an alleged infringement of data protection laws has taken place.
We agree that any disputes regarding our privacy policies and related actions regarding personal information from data subjects in the EU and Switzerland can be heard by a DPA and we will be subject to the determinations of those bodies (as further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles). Please contact us to be directed to the relevant DPA.
 
7. SECURITY
We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access. Despite these measures, no data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit via our websites or apps. Please note that you are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials used to access any Gartner service or account, and you must report suspected unauthorized activity to us.
We make efforts to restrict access to information to only those employees, contractors, and agents who need such access in order to operate, develop, improve, or deliver our programs, products, and services.
