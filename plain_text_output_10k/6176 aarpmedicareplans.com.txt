Website Privacy Policy
Introduction
We recognize the privacy of your personal information is important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website. Portions of this website may describe privacy practices applicable to specific types of information or to information provided on specific web pages.
This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this policy, terms such as "we" or "our" and "Company" refer to UnitedHealthcare and its current and future affiliated entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group.
This website is intended for a United States audience. Any information you provide, including any personal information, will be transferred to and processed by a computer server located within the United States.
Cookies and Tracking
The Company may use various technologies, including cookies, tokens, tags, web logs, web beacons, scripts and web server logs to gather automatically-collected information and may aggregate this information from our Online Services visitors or to enable certain features of our Online Services. This information may include demographic data, technical information about the technology (e.g., phone, computer) used to connect to the Online Services, web browser information, your IP address, and browsing behavior such as pages visited and how often they are visited ("Activity Information"). We may also use third party analytics companies to provide these services.
We may also allow third party service providers to use cookies and other technologies to collect information and to track browsing activity over time and across third party websites such as web browsers used to read our websites, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our websites, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. For more information about third party advertising networks and similar entities that use these technologies, see http://www.aboutads.info/consumers , and to opt-out of such ad networks' and services' advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices and http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices . Once you click the link, you may choose to opt-out of such advertising from all participating advertising companies or only advertising provided by specific advertising companies. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Online Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Activity Information is captured using various technologies and may include cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit an Online Service or click on a URL. Cookies may include "single-session cookies" which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and "persistent" cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire. You may disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on our Online Services. In addition, you may also have additional means to manage the collection of Activity Information by:
Managing the use of "flash" technologies with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website;
Clicking on the available "Opt-Out" link at the bottom of the applicable home web page;
Visiting Google to "Opt-Out" of display advertising or customize Google display network ads; and/or
Clicking on the Optum Pixel "Opt-Out" link .
Please note that we do not currently respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals that provide a method to opt-out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third party websites or online services because, among other reasons, there is no common definition of such signals and no industry-accepted standards for how such signals should be interpreted.
We gather Activity Information about you in order to improve the quality of our services, such as the best method and time to contact you. Without limiting the other ways in which we may use Information as described herein, we may otherwise use and disclose your Activity Information unless restricted by this Policy or by law. Some examples of the ways we use your Activity Information include:
Customizing your experiences, including managing and recording your preferences;
Authenticating your account information;
Tracking resources and data accessed on the Online Services;
Developing reports regarding Online Service usage, activity, and statistics;
Assisting users experiencing problems with our services;
Updating and servicing our Online Services;
Enabling certain functions and tools on the Online Services; and
Tracking paths of visitors to the Online Services and within the Online Services.
As described above, we may use tracking technologies that allow us recognize your device when you return to our Online Services within a period of time, as determined by us, and to support automatic login to your Online Services. To maintain your privacy, you should affirmatively log out of your account prior to your session ending (whether you end your session or we end your session, for example if our Online Services has "timed out" – i.e. we have ended your session automatically after a period of inactivity as determined by us in our sole discretion). Unless you affirmatively log out of your account, you may be automatically logged back in the next time you, or any user of your devices visits the Online Services.
This website may include web pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with personal information about yourself.
