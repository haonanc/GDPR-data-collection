Emuparadise Privacy Policy:
This privacy policy pertains to EmuParadise and all it's subsidiaries. Addressed below are issues relating to our users privacy.
Email Address Privacy:
- Certain parts of EmuParadise (forums, new releases, mailing lists, etc.) require our visitors to submit their email addresses for registration. The purpose of email address submission are two-fold:
To provide whatever service is opted in for by the user.
To verify the identity of the user in certain sensitive areas.
- We take email privacy very seriously and will never release our users email addresses to anyone outside of emuparadise.
- When opting in for an email service you can be sure that we will never send you unsolicited or bulk emails. All email services are opt-in by nature and you can opt-out at any time you wish, either by following the cancellation procedure (mentioned in every email sent to you, from us) or by emailing the webmaster.
Tracking Cookies:
- Our advertisers often use tracking cookies to optimise the serving of advertisments. These tracking cookies do not track any personal information. The only kind of information that is tracked is Geographical Location, Browser Type, Display Resolution and the number of times the site has been visited by you.
- Emuparadise uses tracking cookies to optimise ad serving for you. The only use we make of these cookies is to minimise the number of ads served to you. For example: We use tracking cookies to ensure that none of our visitors are served two consecutive interstitial advertisments in one browser session. (One browser session being limited to 30 minutes)
Spyware/Malware/Adware:
- Emuparadise is absolutely against any of the aforementioned activities. We condemn the nefarious use of spyware/malware/adware on the internet.
- Sometimes such an ad might creep in through our banner networks since it is very hard to control the exact and complete content being served by advertisers. However, if you notify the webmaster of such an experience you can be rest assured we will take care of it and ensure that the malicious ad code is prevented from showing up on Emuparadise.
We will make every effort to protect our users privacy while browsing this website. If you have any privacy related queries, feel free to email info at Emuparadise.org. (Replace at with @ and remove the spaces)
