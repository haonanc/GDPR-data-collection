During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

Cookies
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide certain features associated with our company.
The Help feature on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or how to disable cookies altogether. Also, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of College Marketplace Inc.'s features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Information Sharing 
We are not in the business of selling information we acquire from our customers to others. We share customer information as described below and with our affiliates, and we strongly encourage anyone with whom we share this information with to follow this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in it.
Third Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other companies or business units. If we should do so, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy (including this one), unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise. Also, in the unlikely event that another company acquires College Marketplace Inc. or substantially all of its assets, that company most likely would want to acquire our customer information.
Protection of College Marketplace Inc. and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our other policies, including our Participation Agreement and conditions and guidelines that pertain to the use of our services and including those intended to protect the our rights, property or safety or those of others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. However, this does not include selling, renting, sharing or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.
Security Measures 
The Internet has made it much easier to acquire personal information about others, and no matter what steps we take to protect information, there is no such thing as perfect security on the Internet. Still, we try to protect your information. For instance, we employ certain security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside our company. 
As part of our efforts, we use firewalls and SSL software:
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software encrypts information you input and thus makes it harder for unauthorized persons to find out that information.
We reveal only the last four digits of your credit/debit card (or other payment account information) numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit/debit/other company during order processing.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Also, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your information to identify users using multiple user IDs or aliases. 
As well, although we employ SSL technology to keep your credit card information safe, and use encryption to protect transmitted data, and we will never pass your credit card number through e-mail, nonetheless, for your greater protection, we ask that even when purchasing with your saved credit card numbers, you enter the last four digits of the number. This measure protects your card number if you forget to sign off from our site after making a purchase. As we noted above, you can aid in keeping your personal information safe if you to sign off once you are finished using the site and close down the browser window if you are on a public or shared computer.
In addition: 
1. We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and will only disclose your personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy or with your explicit consent. 
2. We discourage third parties from selling the information we provide to them, to market directly to you, or to disclose it in any other way without your explicit consent. As well, the law may afford you some legal protection against these third parties. 
3. We share your personal information with our own service providers for our operations only to facilitate or outsource our services and operations, but only under confidentiality restrictions. 
4. We disclose limited personal contact information to verified requests by law enforcement and government officials who conduct civil or criminal investigations, or where otherwise required or authorized by law. However, we do require a subpoena for additional personal information. 
5. We allow you to change your personal information so that you can keep it current.
We believe that the security and privacy measures that we take make College Marketplace Inc. a secure place to shop, but unfortunately there are no guarantees.
Choices
As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though you might need to supply that information to make a purchase or to take advantage of certain College Marketplace Inc. features.
You can add or update certain information. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.
