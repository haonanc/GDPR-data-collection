Privacy Statement
EveryMac.com believes                            that your privacy on the Internet, and                            elsewhere, is of great importance. Because                            EveryMac.com gathers information about its                            users, it is important for you, as a user                            of EveryMac.com, to fully understand the                            terms and conditions regarding the                            collection and use of that information.                            This privacy policy discloses what                            information is gathered, how it is used,                            and how you can correct, change, or update                            this information.
This                            privacy policy will answer the following                            questions:
What                               personally identifiable information                               does EveryMac.com collect?
How                               does EveryMac.com use personally                               identifiable information?
With whom, if anyone, does EveryMac.com                               share this information?
What                               options are available regarding the                               collection, use, and distribution of                               this information?
How                               does EveryMac.com allow one to correct,                               change, or update this                               information?
What                               security is in place to minimize the                               risk of loss, misuse, or alteration of                               this information?
What personally identifiable                            information does EveryMac.com                            collect?
When                            browsing the EveryMac.com website, the                            Internet Protocol (IP) address and other                            generic information about your computer is                            collected and stored in a log file and                            with Google Analytics. This information is                            used to help analyze trends, streamline                            the performance of the webserver,                            administer the website, and to gather                            broad statistical information for                            aggregate use. However, this information                            is not intended to be linked to any personally                            identifiable information.
When you                            register as an EveryMac.com member, some                            personal information is collected. During                            the registration process, EveryMac.com                            requires you to provide your name and e-mail                            address, and if you wish to                            participate in contests, your postal                            mailing address. At any point where                            EveryMac.com collects personal                            information, a link will be provided to                            this privacy policy.
How                            does EveryMac.com use personally                            identifiable information?
EveryMac.com                            uses any information  provided                            by members to improve the experience of                            using the website and services provided by                            EveryMac.com, whether to provide                            personalized or interactive portions of                            the site, or to prepare future content                            that is of greater interest to members.                            For example, EveryMac.com operates an                            opt-in mailing list (usually sent                            bimonthly), which is personalized for each                            member.
EveryMac.com                            uses tracking information to determine                            which portions of the site are more                            popular than others, but what individual                            members read is not tracked. Likewise,                            when a search is performed with the                            EveryMac.com search engine, the search                            terms used are recorded, but individual                            search terms are not connected to                            individual members. Both of these tracking                            methods are helpful to determine the                            relative popularity of individual pages                            and to improve the accuracy of the search                            engine, which are beneficial to everyone                            who uses the site.
EveryMac.com                            also creates aggregate reports on member                            demographics and traffic patterns for                            advertisers, sponsors, and business                            partners. This results in advertising                            campaigns that are more effective for                            advertisers, and advertising that is more                            relevant for all users of EveryMac.com.                            However, EveryMac.com does not track the                            usage patterns of individual members, and                            therefore, advertisers, sponsors, and                            business partners will not be able to tell                            that a specific user clicked on a                            particular advertisement by way of EveryMac.com.
With                            whom, if anyone, does EveryMac.com share                            this information?
EveryMac.com,                            and the principal author thereof, is the                            sole owner of all information collected                            from the website and services provided by                            EveryMac.com. EveryMac.com will not sell,                            share, or rent any personally identifiable information to any third-parties, except                            under specific circumstances, as described                            below.
Contest                            Winners: In the event that you win a                            prize from EveryMac.com, you will be                            notified of winning, and permission will                            be requested to provide your name, e-mail                            address, and postal mailing address to the                            sponsoring company, so they can ship your                            prize to you. Obviously, if your postal                            mailing address is not shared, you will                            not be able to receive your prize, as it                            has to be shipped to you. Nevertheless,                            you will be given the option of declining                            your prize. If you do not win a prize in                            an EveryMac.com contest, your information                            will not be shared. However, aggregate                            member demographic information is shared                            with contest sponsors.
Legal: In the event that you are allegedly                            involved in any type of criminal activity                            using the EveryMac.com website, app, or                             services, and EveryMac.com is subpoenaed                            to release your membership information,                            EveryMac.com is required by law to comply                            with the subpoena. EveryMac.com also                            reserves the right to disclose membership                            information in special cases when                            releasing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action                            against any individual who has blatantly                            or repeatedly violated the Terms                            of Use agreement.
EveryMac.com                            does not sell or rent information about                            individual users to anyone for any reason.                            However, EveryMac.com does share aggregate                            demographic information with advertisers,                            sponsors, and business partners, but this                            information is not linked to any personal                            information that could identify any                            individual person. However, in the event                            that EveryMac.com or substantially all of                            its assets are acquired, member                            information will be one of the transferred                            assets.
What                            options are available regarding the                            collection, use, and distribution of this                            information?
When you                            signed up to become a member of                            EveryMac.com, you were given the option of                            joining a personalized mailing list,                            usually sent bimonthly, to inform you of                            site updates. Only EveryMac.com will send                            you these personalized e-mail messages,                            and only if you indicated that you were                            interested in receiving these messages                            when you signed up. If you are not                            interested in receiving site update                            notices, do not request them when you sign                            up, or at any time, you can easily leave                            the list by using the provided instructions .
Companies                            that advertise on EveryMac.com may use                            cookies or other means to  track advertising                            performance. While EveryMac.com uses                            cookies to store login information,                            cookies received with advertisements are                            collected by the advertising companies,                            and EveryMac.com does not have any access                            to this information.
EveryMac.com                            provides advertisers, sponsors, and                            business partners with aggregate                            information only, in such a manner that                            neither the client nor EveryMac.com can                            associate any individual or their                            associated membership profile within the                            aggregate information.
