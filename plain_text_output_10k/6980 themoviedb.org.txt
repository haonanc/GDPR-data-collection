YOUR INFORMATION: WHAT WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT, AND HOW IT IS USED
In common with most other websites and on-line services, we collect certain data about your visit to the Fanhattan  Properties. Any data we gather through your use of a Fanhattan Property falls into three categories: (1) personal information that you supply to us, such as information you provide when you register (including your e-mail address), create an account, create a username, register your device, complete a survey, enter a contest, or purchase products or services; (2) information that is collected as you use a Fanhattan Property that becomes associated with your personal information; and (3) information that does not directly identify you and is collected as you use Fanhattan Property, including your IP address, and information gathered with the use of a "cookie" (cookies are discussed further below), and information related to searches or recommendations in connection with a Fanhattan Property. Such information includes, without limitation, which pages and content are browsed, interactions with advertising and content, and other data related to preferences and usage. We use this information to, among other things, provide our services to you, create new products and services, and target advertising and content (on our and our business associates’ websites) to generate statistics, reports and for various analytic purposes (including combining the data we collect with data from other sources).
You may use certain Fanhattan Properties without registering or creating an account. We may nonetheless build a history of your interactions with a Fanhattan Property even though we don't know who you are.
Regarding Fanhattan Properties that are products, Fanhattan may also employ update management software to collect installation and registry information from your computer, including product, version, build, language and original equipment manufacturer. When you use multiple  Fanhattan  Properties,  Fanhattan  may combine or link information collected from various Fanhattan  Properties and use it for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
Personal information
As is common across websites, to use certain features of a Fanhattan Property we may ask you to register, create an account, provide your full name and email address and create a password. Once you have created an account, you will have the option to fill out a form to create your profile (all or portions of the information you submit may be included in your profile). When you create your profile, we collect personal information about you, such as name, address, location, e-mail address, favorite actors, music, etc., which will be stored in order to provide services to you and to conduct other activities including, without limitation, processing your registration, maintaining a profile about you, processing your request to receive newsletters and email announcements, or to voluntarily participate in surveys or contests, and/or communicating with you about services and products we think may be of interest to you.
Fanhattan may allow you to set up a public profile that may be viewed by other users of the  Fanhattan  Properties. You may choose to include some personal information in your public profile so that other users can identify you. You should only include information in your public profile that you do not mind making publicly available without restriction.
To process your purchase orders we require your name, billing address, phone number, e-mail address, shipping address, credit card information and credit card security codes. We use this information to process your order(s) and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order(s). We may also use it to contact you about other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. In general, Fanhattan will first try to e-mail you, but may contact you by phone or send an electronic message to you if you have provided these details and your consent to such contact.
Personal information is also used to provide personalized services to you, such as show tracking and recommendations.
We may provide data about our users, traffic patterns, products, services and site information to third-parties (such as vendors, advertisers and our business associates) (“Third Parties”), but, except as otherwise described in this policy, we will use reasonable efforts to provide it in a form that does not directly identify you.
Creation of Anonymous Data. We may create anonymous data records from your personal information (“Anonymous Data”) by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. Once we create Anonymous Data, this Anonymous Data becomes our property. We use this Anonymous Data in many ways including analyzing user request and usage patterns, creating reports and performing analytics so that we may enhance the content of our services, improving site navigation and providing meaningful analysis of habits, usage, trends, and effectiveness of marketing campaigns, etc. as part of our products and services. Fanhattan reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its absolute discretion.
Social Media and Profiles. For certain Fanhattan Properties, the information that we may ask you to provide could include name, gender, location, e-mail address, biographical information and the movies and television shows that you like to watch. When you create your profile, you may be asked if you want your profile to be public or private. Unless you state that you want your profile to be private, your profile will be available for public viewing.
Public Content. Your photos, posts, friends, and other content you post to the Fanhattan Properties (and your profile if you designate it as public, including your first name and last initial but excluding any other account registration information) are meant for public consumption. We may display this content on the Fanhattan Properties and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.
Facebook and other Social Networking Sites. If you are logged into Facebook or another social networking site (“SNS”) that we support, and you access but are not logged into the Fanhattan Property, we may receive information from Facebook or the SNS to make it easier for you to create an account on the Fanhattan Property and to show our relevant content from your Facebook or SNS friends. This information personalizes your experience and helps you create an account (where this option is available). You may also be able to connect your account on the Fanhattan Property to your accounts on Facebook or other SNSs, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third party service. We use this information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers.
Material You Choose to Reveal in On-line Fora, Blogs, Message Boards, Chat Rooms or Similar Locations. You may be able to post personal information on areas of a Fanhattan Property that may be viewed by other users or the public, although we recommend that you do not do so. Please note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, including persons who may be acting under false pretenses. Please choose carefully the information you post on the Fanhattan Property and that you give to other Fanhattan Property users. You are discouraged from publicly posting your full name, telephone numbers, street addresses or other information that identifies you or allows strangers to find you or steal your identity. Be aware that other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled.
