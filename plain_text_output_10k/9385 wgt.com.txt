Privacy Policy Updates
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, we update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When doing so, WGT will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at https://www.wgt.com/privacy.aspx so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we collect and how we use this information, and ask for your consent to the changes if required by applicable law. WGT encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.

Due to the nature of some of these activities, we collect personally identifiable information, including your contact information such as your email address, username, password, player name, zip code, country, age and gender. We use your personally identifiable information to contact you to provide you with the services for which you have registered, enter you in contests for which you have registered, for internal marketing purposes, and to improve our products and services. If you use WGT's "tell a friend" or "send replay" features, we may ask you to submit your friend's email address and we will only use such email address to send the requested information or replay.

Social Site Information Collection and Use
When you use any WGT service at a Social Site, where WGT games are also referred to as "applications", you allow WGT to access certain information from your profile for that Social Site. The information you allow WGT to access varies by game and Social Site platform, and it is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the Social Site. You can control and find out more about these settings at the Social Site where you play our games. For example, WGT will access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the Social Site and your preferences: your first and last name; your profile picture or its URL; your user ID number, which is linked to publically available information such as name and profile photo; the user ID numbers for your friends that are also connected to our game(s); the login email you provided to that Social Site when you registered; your physical location and that of your access devices; your gender; and your birthday.
By playing a WGT game through a Social Site, you understand WGT will collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information that you have allowed the Social Site to provide to WGT through the Social Site Application Programming Interface ("API"). Your agreement takes place when you "accept" or "allow" (or similar terms) one of our applications on a Social Site.
To manage the information WGT receives about you from the Social Site where you play our games, you will need to follow the instructions at that Social Site for updating your information and changing your privacy settings.
Once WGT receives your information from a Social Site, that information is stored and used by WGT in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and you may access and update that information as described below.
Children's Privacy
WGT recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. WGT does not target its services or this Site to children under 13. WGT does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If WGT has actual knowledge that personally identifiable information about a person under the age of 13 has been collected without appropriate parental consent, then WGT will take the appropriate steps to delete such information.
Aggregate Information
The Site tracks the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, pages visited per use, browser type, IP addresses, exit page, duration of use, operating system type, and we will analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for use and disclosure in aggregate form.
Cookies and Third-Party Advertising
We use small text files called cookies and related tracking technologies (collectively, "cookies") to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's device or browser containing information about how the user interacts with our Site and services. We use cookies to provide the Site or services, gather information about your usage patterns when you navigate this Site or services in order to enhance your personalized experience, and to understand usage patterns to improve the Site and services. As detailed below, we also allow certain trusted partners to place cookies on our Site and services in order to provide personalized marketing to you.
Advertising
We use third-party advertising companies to place cookies on our Site and services in order serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this Site and our services and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Specifically, advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria-for example, people aged 30-50 from a particular geographic area. WGT does not provide any personally identifiable information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement.
Your choices
You can review your Internet browser settings, typically under the sections "Help" or "Internet Options" and use our cookie management tool (button below) to exercise choices you have for certain cookies, including for interest based advertising. If you disable or delete certain non-essential cookies, you might not be able to access or use important functions or features of this Site or services, and you may be required to re-enter your log-in details. Please note you may also still receive advertisements from the relevant ad serving company you opted out of, but the ads will not be tailored to your interests. For our mobile app please review your device settings or third-party tools available.
WGT games or their purchase pages may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third-party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These are not offers made by WGT. These offers will be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a web site hosted by WGT or partnering SNS. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your user ID number, will be shared with the offer wall provider. This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you will then return to a WGT web site or game.

If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information to such third-party contest sponsors by not opting-in and not providing any information. Their use of your personally identifiable information will be subject to their privacy policies and terms of use and they may contact you with marketing messages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you register to participate in a challenge or tournament on the Site that is a benefit for a charity and you pay an entry fee and/or make a donation to that charity, you acknowledge and agree that we will provide all personally identifiable information you submit during registration to the charity so that they may communicate with you regarding the tax deductibility of any donation you make and generally about the activities of the charity.

When legally required or at WGT's discretion, WGT will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of suspicious or alleged illegal activity on this Site or on the Internet. Additionally, your information, and the contents of your private online communications, will be accessed and disclosed (i) in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process; (iii) in other circumstances in which WGT believes the WGT games or web sites are being used in the commission of a crime (including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction); (iv) when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or another person; and (v) when necessary either to protect the rights or property of WGT including to enforce our Terms of Service, or for us to render the service you have requested.

Security
We employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. WGT will use password protection, encryption and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. However, no security measure can guarantee against compromise. You also have an important role in protecting personally identifiable information. You should not share your usernames/email addresses and passwords with anyone, and you should not re-use passwords across more than one web site. If you have any reason to believe that your username/email or password have been compromised, please contact us as detailed below.
Data Subject Rights
Where required by applicable law, you have the right to obtain confirmation of the existence of certain personally identifiable information relating to you, to verify its content, origin, and accuracy, as well as the right to access, review, obtain a copy, port, delete, or to block or withdraw consent to the processing of certain personally identifiable information (without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal), by contacting us as detailed below. Additionally, you have the right to object to our use of personally identifiable information for direct marketing and certain cookies at any time. Contact us below for more details. Please note that we need to retain certain personally identifiable information as required or permitted by applicable law.
Cross-Border Data Transfers
Our computer systems are currently based in the United States, so your personally identifiable information will be processed by us in the U.S. where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world, such as the European Union. If you create a user account with the Site or otherwise provide us with personally identifiable information, as a visitor from outside the United States, where permitted by applicable law, by using the Site you agree to this Privacy Policy and you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection of that required in other countries. We take steps to securely maintain personally identifiable information transferred to the US.
Other Issues
What is the legal basis of processing?
Some jurisdictions require an explanation of the legal basis for the collection and processing of personally identifiable information. We have several different legal grounds on which we collect and process personally identifiable information, including: (a) as necessary to perform a transaction (such as when we respond to your requests); (b) as necessary to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we use personally identifiable information for record keeping to substantiate tax liability); (c) consent (where you have provided consent as appropriate under applicable law, such as for marketing or certain cookies); and (d) necessary for legitimate interests (such as when we act to maintain our business generally). With respect to legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of you which require protection of personally identifiable information, such legitimate interests are the fulfilment of the processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy that are not necessary for the performance of a contract or for our compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject.
What are the consequences of not providing personally identifiable information?
You are not required to provide all personally identifiable information identified in this Privacy Policy to use the Site or services, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide personally identifiable information. If you do not provide personally identifiable information, we may not be able to enter you into contests, respond to your requests, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable.
Do we engage in automated decision-making without human intervention?
We do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects concerning you or otherwise significantly affects you.
Does the Site honor do not track ("DNT") signals sent via browsers?
Given the divergent practices of organizations that offer browsers and the lack of a standard in the marketplace, we generally do not respond to DNT signals at this time.
How long do we retain personally identifiable information?
We typically retain personally identifiable information related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and we will securely delete such data in accordance with applicable law upon request. For personally identifiable information that we collect and process for other purposes, we typically retain such personally identifiable information for no longer than for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and as otherwise needed to address tax, corporate, compliance, litigation, and other legal rights and obligations.
Questions
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy please contact us via email at: members@worldgolftour.com. You may also have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.
