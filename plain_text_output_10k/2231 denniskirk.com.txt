Security
We go to great lengths to keep your information private and safe so you can buy on-line with confidence.                 All credit card transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse                 or alteration of information collected.  We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard in                 transferring information to process your order. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information                 into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. SSL can be identified by the key or                 closed lock that appears in the upper left hand corner of your browser.
DennisKirk.com is proud to display the DigiCert Secure Site Seal.  The seal is proudly displayed on                 our homepage to assure our customers that DennisKirk.com's site is authentic and that all                 transactions are secured by SSL encryption.
We have adopted reasonable and appropriate physical, administrative and technical security practices to                 help protect against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access to the information you provide to us.                 Please note, however, that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a                 result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the                 security of any information you disclose via the Website and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.
You should never use the same password on multiple sites.  If you ever think your password has been                 compromised, reset your password right away.
Children's Policy
Dennis Kirk is committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet. We do not direct our             services to those under the age of 13, or knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information of those             under the age of 13. If we are made aware we have collected personal information from a child under 13             years old in a manner that is inconsistent with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will             delete this information as soon as possible.
Your California privacy rights
California law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of             personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.             To make such a request, please send an email to info@denniskirk.com .
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to a website. Because of differences in how web             browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these             signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no             industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals,             we currently do not take action in response to these signals.
International users
Our Website is directed towards users who reside in the United States. By using the Services, you affirm             that you reside in the United States, and you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer             of your information in and to the United States, pursuant to the laws of the United States.             We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose information of European Union residents.
Changes to our policy
Our Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with the safest and most secure shopping experience possible.             We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time,             with or without prior notice. If policy changes are substantial, we will notify our customers via             email. We suggest that you periodically review our Privacy Policy.
