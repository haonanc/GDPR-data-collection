This Privacy Policy applies to all pages and subdomains of "fuskator.com". By using our services and/or registering with Fuskator,              you acknowledge and accept the provisions in this Privacy Policy and grant us permission to collect, store, and use the items of              personal information described herein, so long as Fuskator adheres to the standards set forth more clearly below.
We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time and provide such amendments to you by posting a revised version on              our website. If the revised version includes a substantial change, we will provide you with thirty (30) days’ notice prior to the              effectiveness thereof by posting notice of the change in a prominent place on the Fuskator website, such as presenting to you a              click-through page immediately following your account login. Otherwise, in the case of insubstantial changes, the revised version              will be effective at the time we post it. In any event, we will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your              explicit consent, and we expect most changes will be minor.
