Privacy Policy
At MediaAlpha, protecting your personal information is a top priority. This Privacy Policy provides details on how we treat your personal information.  QuoteLab, LLC, which does business as MediaAlpha ("we" or “us”), is the Data Controller with respect to information collected on the websites we own.
Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to:
information collected through this website, Healthplans.com, along with any other website owned and operated by MediaAlpha (the “Sites”);
information you enter into our forms appearing on third-party websites;
certain limited information regarding your interaction with advertiser sites following a visit to our Sites, solely for attribution and optimization purposes;
information obtained during phone calls to us that you initiate, or that we or our partners may initiate with your prior consent; and
any other information you choose to provide to us.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other companies or to which we may link (except for the limited situation set forth above), or to any information you may provide directly to an insurance agent or carrier, travel agent, or other service provider who you are connected with through our service.
Information We Collect and Use
We collect and use personal information about you to respond to your request for products and services offered through the Sites. Specifically, we collect information provided by you in connection with obtaining price quotes or rates. For example, you may be asked to provide your name, address, telephone number, email, and other information in order to be matched to insurance carriers and agents who may provide you a quote for their insurance services.  Or you may be asked to provide home and destination airports and travel dates so that we can show you flight and hotel options.
We may also collect other information such as gender, zip code, or other demographic information that is not tied to your personal information.  Included in this demographic information is your IP address, which is treated as personal information in some jurisdictions, but which we use only to identify your geographic area and for legal compliance purposes.
In addition, we might receive information about you from other online or offline sources and may combine that information with the information you have provided.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We share personal information about you under the following circumstances:
Quote Requests. If you submit a request for price quotes for insurance products or other products or services, we will share the personal information contained in your request form (such as your name, address, telephone number, email, information about your cars, travel destination, etc.) with third parties, which may include agents, carriers, lead aggregators, and other service providers in our network, to process and fulfill your request.
Our agreements require service providers to secure any personal information we provide to them and limit how they can use such information. Our agreements also require these service providers to comply with national, state and other applicable privacy regulations. By submitting your request to us, you understand that service providers may contact you by telephone (including through automated calling or using recorded messages), email, or regular mail based on the information you provided to us, in order to process and fulfill your request, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, or any similar mechanism to opt-out of receiving phone calls or email messages.
If one of the service providers contacts you and you wish not to be contacted again by that service provider, then you should specifically make a request of them. Please note that service providers may maintain the information you provided whether or not you elect to use their services.
You can find a list of service providers currently in our network here .
Aggregate, Non-Personal, or De-identified Information. We may share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal, de-identified, or anonymous information we collect, with third parties to optimize their ability to reach their target markets.
As Required by Law. We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances whenever we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
Business Transfer. As with any other business, it is possible that we could in the future enter into a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale. If such a transaction occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including your personal information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy.
