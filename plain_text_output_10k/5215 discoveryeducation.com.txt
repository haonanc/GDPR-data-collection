Highlights
Discovery Education has stringent policies and procedures in place to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and to prevent data breaches, including
the use of industry standard encryption and other technical security measures.

solely to enable the student user to access and utilize the functionality of the
subscription services provided by Discovery Education.
This Privacy Policy applies to users of the discoveryeducation.com website, (the “DE
Website”) and to users of the password-protected online subscription services located
at DE Website (the “Subscription Services” and together with the DE Website, the
“Services”) controlled by Discovery Education, Inc. and/or its subsidiary and affiliated
entities (“Discovery Education,” “we” or “us”) where this Privacy Policy is posted.
This Privacy Policy does not pertain to information that is collected offline.
This Privacy Policy provides you with details about the personal information we collect from you, how we use your personal information, and your rights regarding the personal information we hold about you.

By accessing or browsing our site or requesting the provision of subscription services from us, you confirm that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy in its entirety. You consent to the TERMS AND CONDITIONS of this Privacy Policy, and to our processing of personal information for the purposes stated below.
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

For details on the information collected and used from children under the age of 13, see section below titled Collection and Use of Information from Children under the Age of 13.
When you access and browse our sites (including when you submit personal information to us through data entry fields on the website), enter a competition or contest, fill in an order form for our Services and where we provide Services to you, we collect the following types of information from you:
“Personally Identifiable Information” is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, email address, or school name. Discovery collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable information on the Services:
For non-student users of the Subscription Services, we may collect your email address, first and last name and zip code if you sign up for an online newsletter;
We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you
choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes;
We may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address — Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data — such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Services to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Services.
We may use Cookies to help personalize your experience — A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Services. For example, when someone visits a page within the Services, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Services previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with  your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of our Services. To read more about how we use cookies and our Cookie Policy, please click here .
We may collect your email address if you contact us with a question.
We may collect your first and last name and email address if you choose to provide it in connection with your account registration.
We may collect your email address, place of residence and other information from your public profile if you interact with our social media pages, IE Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc….  so we can tailor our interactions to you.
The above list provides examples of the personally identifiable information that may be collected when using the Services. If you do not want Discovery to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. When provided, we may use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Services meets your needs. Please note that we also consider certain aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable information.
Use, Storage, and Deletion of Information Collected Via Our Services
The information Discovery Education collects enables us to tailor our Services to be more relevant and impactful to you.  Our purpose when collecting, storing, and using information is to provide you the most engaging and rewarding experience with our Services and to ensure you have full access to our sites pursuant to our Terms of Use.
Discovery Education DOES NOT sell your data to third parties.
Following is additional information on how we use, store, and delete data collected via our services.
Personally Identifiable Information: We use your personally identifiable
information that is collected on the Services primarily for the following purposes:
To deliver services you request, license or purchase, such as educational programs, information, newsletters or software. For student users, we use the information to present personalized pages.
For non-student users of the Subscription Services who have opted-in to
receiving Discovery Education information, and for other users of our Services who have provided contact information through the DE Website or otherwise, to alert you to Service enhancements, new content, professional development opportunities, special events, educational programs and news from Discovery.
To complete a transaction or service requested by you.
To ensure the Services are relevant to your needs.
To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.
To notify you about a change to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use , if
necessary.
To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Services.
To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or Order Inquiry.
Sometimes, our use of your personal information is for purposes which are ancillary to the provision of the Site or our Services. In those circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your personal information, and do not believe that this storage and use of your personal information will unduly prejudice your rights or freedoms.
The relevant circumstances include:
Detecting and preventing fraud;
Keeping our websites, apps, products and IT systems secure;
Ensuring that our own processes, procedures and systems are as efficient as possible;
Analyzing and enhancing the information that we collect, with the goal of reducing what information we collect (IE, Privacy by Design);
For service administration requirements where we need to contact you for reasons related to the Service (for example, where we need to send you a password reminder, to notify you about services updates or amendments to our Terms of Use , Cookies Policy or Privacy Policy);
In some very limited circumstances, we will need to handle your personal information in a certain way to comply with our legal requirements; for example, if we are asked by regulatory bodies or law enforcement agencies to share the information; and
Where you have given us your consent, contacting you (including by SMS and e-mail) with products and services which we think may interest you. We do not contact pupils for this purpose.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
Non-personally identifiable information is used as described above and in other
ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally
identifiable information with personally identifiable information. When combined,
we treat the combined information as personally identifiable information for the
purposes of this policy.
Anonymous Data
For individuals not logged into our sites, we collect anonymized details about visitors to our sites for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes. However, no single individual will be identifiable from the anonymized details we collect for these purposes.  When you login to our site, we do collect PII in a secured manner to ensure full website functionality.
Storage of Information
Discovery Education takes significant precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of our customers’ data. We employ firewalls as well as advanced technology safeguards, such as intrusion prevention detection systems and carefully developed security procedures based on CSA Cloud Controls Matrix, to protect our customers’ data from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration.
When we collect sensitive personal information, we encrypt the data at rest and in transmission. We use industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  Additional safeguards include independent security assessments and vulnerability scanning.
Destruction of Information:
Upon expiration or termination of any subscriber agreement, we destroy all PII previously received from Subscriber/Customer no later than sixty (60) days following such termination, unless a reasonable written request is submitted by Subscriber/Customer/Distributor to Discovery to hold such PII.  Each electronic file containing PII provided by Subscriber/Customer/Distributor to Discovery will be securely destroyed.
Sharing and Disclosure of Information: If We Share Information, Who We Share It With
As mentioned before, we do not, and will not, sell your personal data to any third-party. However, in certain instances we do share your data as outlined below:
Personally Identifiable Information: We may share or disclose your personally
identifiable information in the following instances:
(i) To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you subscribe to the Subscription Services,
we may share your personally identifiable information in order to administer or maintain
your subscription. If you choose to watch an educational program contained within the
Services, we may share your personally identifiable information in order to provide the
program to you. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address
to process your request and respond to your question.
(ii) For non-student users of the Subscription Services who opt-in to receive such
information, to affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other
unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of
interest to you. Or, entities who require your personally identifiable information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may use your
personally identifiable information to contact you with an offer or advertisement related
to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research,
administration or business purposes. If you do not want us to share your personally
identifiable information in this manner, please do not opt-in to receive this information.
(iii) To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who
help us maintain our Services and provide other administrative services to us (including,
but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service,
maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on Discovery’s
behalf, and other promotions to those non-student users who opt-in). We seek to ensure
that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for
any purpose other than to provide the administrative services for which they are
responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us
administer our Services will have access to users’ personally identifiable information, if
you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your
information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to
us.
(iv) To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in
order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us,
protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of Discovery
and the Services, or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our
end users.
(v) To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not
limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
(v) To IT infrastructure companies, that enable us to either deliver our Services to you or provide service and support to the Services you have licensed
(vi) To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical
information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third
parties.
(vii) To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information
collected from these Services. In the course of such verification, we may receive
personally identifiable information about you from such services.
Except as described in this privacy policy or at the time we explicitly request the information, we do not otherwise use, share, or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Services in the manner
disclosed above. We may share this non-personal information with third parties.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information from Children
In most instances, Discovery will only request the first name and email address of the
child in order to complete an immediate request from the child. The information that is
collected will only be used for the requested purpose and will be deleted after
such use.
For students using the Subscription Services, any personally identifiable information
that may be provided, which may include but not be limited to first and last name, grade
and school, will be provided by the school district, individual school, or individual using
the Service.
Use of Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Children
When we collect personally identifiable information from children, we will only use that
information for the express purpose for which it was collected. The personally
identifiable information will not be used for any other purpose.
Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Children
Except as provided in this Section, we do not share personally identifiable information
collected from children with any unaffiliated third parties. We may, however, share a
child’s personally identifiable information that we have collected from the child’s school
district, school or from the child through the provision of Services in the following limited
instances:
We may share such information with third-party service providers who help
Discovery maintain the Services and provide other administrative services to us. We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties may not use the personally
identifiable information for any other purpose. These unaffiliated third parties
have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of the personally identifiable information.
We may disclose children’s’ personally identifiable information to third parties if we believe we are required to do so in order to comply with law (including court orders and subpoenas); to comply with requests from law enforcement agencies  or the government; to enforce our Terms of Use ; to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property and the rights, privacy, safety or property of our employees or other users of our Services; to protect our operations; and to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
Non Personally Identifiable Information
We collect and store the non personally identifiable information that is described in
this Privacy Policy. We do not, however, link this information to personally identifiable information when it is collected from children.
Note to Parents and Legal Guardians
Please contact Discovery at any time regarding privacy questions or concerns, or to
request to review what personally identifiable information we have collected from a
child. Parents may also contact us at any time to request that we delete the personally
identifiable information of a child or a parent and/or refuse to permit further collection or
use of a child’s information. We will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us
for a child’s information is that child’s parent or guardian.

If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, Discovery Education may transfer that information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties (in line with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use), across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.
If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws
governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information to the United States which has different data protection laws than the EU. By providing your personally identifiable information you consent to:

Changes to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we
will also revise the “last update” date at the bottom of this privacy policy.

We will also notify the applicable schools if we change the kinds of information that we collect from children and materially alter our practices of sharing and using this

Contacting Discovery Education
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at privacy@discoveryeducation.com.
All information you provide in any written communication will also be covered by this policy. Unless you are a user of the Subscription Services that is subject to an agreement with Discovery Education that expressly addresses Dispute
Resolution, Choice of Law, and/or Choice of Forum, the following Sections apply to you, as applicable.
Dispute Resolution
In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) related to or arising out of
your use of the Services, other than disputes related to or involving Discovery Education’s intellectual property or Discovery Education’s licensed intellectual or proprietary rights, you and Discovery Education mutually agree to the following dispute resolution procedure:
1. The parties will first attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute by informal
negotiation. The informal negotiation period will begin when the party asserting
the dispute sends a written notice to the other party describing the facts and
circumstances of the dispute. If, after sixty (60) days from the date the notice of
dispute is sent, the parties have been unable to resolve the dispute, either party
may commence binding arbitration. The parties may agree to extend the informal
dispute resolution period by mutual written agreement.
2. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation, you
and Discovery agree that exclusive jurisdiction for the dispute shall be binding
arbitration before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties. If the
parties cannot agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall each select one
Arbitrator from the list of qualified JAMS arbitrators and those two Arbitrators
shall select the person who shall serve as the Arbitrator for such dispute.
Arbitration shall be initiated in the Washington, DC area and shall be
administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
Procedures. Judgment on any potential award may be entered in any court
having jurisdiction. BY USING THE SITES, YOU ARE HEREBY GIVING UP
YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR
JURY. Unless the arbitrator concludes that the arbitration was frivolous or
brought for an improper purpose, Discovery Education will pay all filing, JAMS, and
arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
3. ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. Neither
party shall have the right to have a dispute heard as a class action, and no
arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written
consent of all parties to the proceeding.
Choice of Law
This Privacy Policy has been made in and shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.
The parties acknowledge that this Policy evidences a transaction involving interstate
commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to
applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this
Policy shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
Choice of Forum
By using the Discovery Sites, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute
not subject to the arbitration provision discussed above shall be the state and federal
courts located in Maryland.
PRIVACY RIGHTS
Discovery does not support Do Not Track browser settings and does not currently
participate in any “Do Not Track” frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals
or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your Personally Identifiable
Information or Non Personally Identifiable Information.
As of January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding Discovery’s disclosure of personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
To make such a request, please contact us:
