1. What does the EarthLink Consumer Privacy Policy cover?
This Privacy Policy covers (i) the collection, use and retention of personally identifiable information ("PII") from our customers and visitors to www.earthlink.net under the Consumer tab ("EarthLink Consumer Website") and (ii) your options with regard to that collection and use.   The EarthLink Consumer Website and the services and products offered on or through the EarthLink Consumer Website are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "EarthLink Consumer Services".
EarthLink is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your PII and will not share, sell or license your PII except in very limited circumstances as described below.   All PII collected by EarthLink including, but not limited to, via the Internet, via any EarthLink Consumer mobile application, via mail or over the telephone is protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy.
2. What is PII?
PII is any information that can be used to personally identify you, including, but not limited to:
Information you provide when you register for certain services and products available on or through the EarthLink Consumer Website including your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, and credit card number.  
Transaction and activity information about your EarthLink Consumer Services; your customer account and billing records; yourinteractions with our customer service representatives over the telephone, email or through online chat; your contest entries; and how you use your EarthLink Consumer Services.
3. How we use your PII
EarthLink uses your PII to (i) provide your EarthLink Consumer Services to you, (ii) establish and manage your customer account and billing records, (iii) contact you about your customer account including your EarthLink Consumer Services and other products and services that we offer or that we offer in conjunction with an affiliate company, (iv) provide you with additional information that may be of interest to you such as news about EarthLink, (v) resolve billing problems, (vi) provide customized technical support, (vii) monitor your EarthLink Consumer Services, (viii) monitor and protect our network, (ix) protect against fraudulent, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of the EarthLink Consumer Services, (x) provide customized personal start pages, and (xi) administer surveys and contests.
If you apply online for a position at EarthLink, we will only use the information you provided for job recruitment and other customary human resources purposes.
PII may be supplemented with information received from publicly available sources, such as demographic information, to help us develop and improve the EarthLink Consumer Services and to choose and send marketing offers to you that may be of interest to you.
4. How EarthLink protects the Security of PII
EarthLink has implemented an information security program that contains administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to safeguard your PII and other non-personally identifiable information. We use industry standards to secure PII when it is being collected and transmitted over the Internet as well as firewalls, security monitoring, encryption and intrusion detection software. Although we cannot guarantee that our information security program will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose your PII, we maintain security and incident response practices to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to PII.
Under our practices and policies, access to PII is authorized only for EarthLink employees and contractors who have a business need for such access, and records are stored in accordance with applicable laws and then securely destroyed.  EarthLink employees and contractors are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use of and disclosure of PII.
As an extra precaution, you should not share your password with anyone. EarthLink will only ask you for your password as part of a customer service or technical support call or online chat, and only in cases where you request customer support to access your account information or you request customer or technical support to correct a service problem.
5. Sharing of PII in Limited Circumstances
EarthLink will not share, sell, or license your PII to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.  EarthLink may disclose your PII in response to:
Subpoenas, court orders, search warrants or other valid legal process, or as otherwise authorized by law,
Circumstances where EarthLink has a good faith belief that a crime has been committed by an EarthLink customer or visitor,
An emergency that poses a safety threat to you or another person, or
Possible violations of the EarthLink Acceptable Use Policy or other EarthLink policies, available at http://www.earthlink.net/about/policies/
When EarthLink uses third parties to perform business functions on our behalf, we require them through contracts to treat your PII confidentially and to only use your PII for the express purpose of providing the specific business functions for EarthLink. Examples of such third parties include, but are not limited to: (i) merchant banks for credit card authorizations, (ii) collection agencies, (iii) customer service companies, and (iv) market research companies.
Some EarthLink Consumer Services are offered to EarthLink customers in conjunction with a third-party vendor. For example, we outsource the provision of stock quotes and operation of your stock portfolio (accessible through your personal start page) to a third-party vendor. To provide these services, the vendor may need to collect and store your PII but the vendor will be required by contract with EarthLink to maintain the confidentiality of your PII.
If ownership of EarthLink changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or the sale of its assets, your PII may be transferred or assigned as part of the transferred assets. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your PII, we will notify you about the material change.

Anonymous and/or aggregated data that does not identify any specific individuals are outside the scope of this Privacy Policy. Sometimes we share Non-PII with other companies that help us deliver and improve the EarthLink Consumer Services. Some EarthLink customers have co-branded personal start pages that are cosponsored by third parties. EarthLink may share Non-PII with such third parties in order to more effectively market co-branded products or services to EarthLink customers who use these co-branded personal start pages. EarthLink also shares Non-PII with third parties that assist EarthLink in analyzing the results of surveys or the traffic on the EarthLink Consumer Website.
If you post any comments to any of the public areas of the EarthLink Consumer Website such as blogs, forums or "Ask Email Guy," your comments can be read or used by other visitors to the EarthLink Consumer Website and any PII that you post in such public areas could be used by other visitors to contact you or for other purposes.  You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information in these public areas. EarthLink is not responsible for any PII you choose to submit through these or other features.
EarthLink may share Non-PII with select advertisers. In some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display advertisements to specific audiences. EarthLink does not share PII with these advertisers.  We use DoubleClick and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the EarthLink Consumer Website. These advertising companies may use Non-PII about your visits to the EarthLink Consumer Website in order to provide advertisements on the EarthLink Consumer Website about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, you can go to www.networkadvertising.org .
