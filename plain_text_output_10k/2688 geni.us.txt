1. Overview
GeoRiot provides a set of services ("Genius Link Services") to commercial customers ("Clients")             for purposes of online marketing and sales of digital and physical products and services ("Products")             to individual consumers. The Genius Link Services are provided to Clients worldwide, including in the United             States ("US"), the member states of the European Union ("EU"), and Switzerland. The             Genius Link Services are provided under the names "Genius Link" and "BookLinker.com." The Genius Link             Services are not provided to individuals as consumers.
The Genius Link Services are dynamic links that are used to connect consumers visiting or interacting with             a Client's websites, applications, social media, electronic documents, eBooks, text messages and other             online digital properties ("Digital Properties") to retail websites ("Storefronts") maintained by             international goods and services retailers ("Retailers") where Products identified on the Client's Digital             Property ("Products") can be purchased. These dynamic links are called "Geni.us Links." Digital Properties             including Geni.us Links are accessed through a personal computer, laptop, smartphone or other device             providing Internet access through a browser ("Device") when an individual follows the Geni.us Link to a             Storefront.
Information is collected automatically via a Geni.us Link when an individual using a Device clicks a             Geni.us Link in the course of viewing and interacting with content on a Client's Digital Properties (a             "Transaction"). Such an individual is referred to as a "Buyer" in this Policy. The information collected is             referred to as "Potential Personal Information" in this Policy, and is described below. The core terms             applicable to Potential Personal Information are provided in Sections 3, 5, 6 and 8.
GeoRiot also collects information about individuals acting as or on behalf of Clients for purposes of the             Genius Link Services ("Client Personal Data"). Client Personal Data may be collected in the course of Client             account registration and in communications and transactions between the Client and GeoRiot. The core terms             applicable to Client Personal Data are provided in Section 4, 5, 7 and 8.
2. Adherence to Privacy Shield
GeoRiot and the Genius Link Services comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.             Privacy Shield Framework and the Privacy Shield Principles (collectively "Privacy Shield") as set forth by             the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from EU             member nations and Switzerland.
This compliance includes both Potential Personal Information, whether or not such information is in fact             Personal Data for purposes of EU data protection laws and Privacy Shield, and Client Personal Data.
GeoRiot has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability             for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and             liability. To learn more about Privacy Shield, and to view GeoRiot's certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov .
GeoRiot will adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles, as they may be amended from time to time, with             respect to and for as long as it retains Potential Personal Information or Client Personal Data collected or             maintained while this Privacy Policy is in effect.
3. Collection and Processing of Potential Personal Information
GeoRiot does not provide any products or services to individuals or engage in transactions or             communications with them. GeoRiot also does not collect or use information such as names, addresses or other             contact information, governmental or corporate identification numbers, account numbers or images, or other             information which specifically identifies individuals ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII").
GeoRiot does collect and use the information described below. While none of this information in itself             identifies any specific individual, it may be possible to use some of this information in combination with             information from other sources to identify individual Buyers. As a matter of due diligence and prudence             GeoRiot has taken appropriate measures to ensure the security, integrity and ethical use of such             information, called "Potential Personal Information" for purposes of this Policy. GeoRiot does not combine             Potential Personal Information with other data to identify individuals for purposes of the Services.
When a Buyer clicks a Geni.us Link the following information is collected automatically. The information             collected is determined by the coding of the Geni.us Link by GeoRiot.
Information identifying the operating system and browser used by the Device for the Transaction ("User                 Agent Information"), including information identifying and describing the Device used for the                 Transaction ("Device Data").
Information identifying the language used by the Device for the Transaction ("Language Information").
The Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the Device used for the Transaction, which allows                 identification of the logical and to some extent geographical location of the Device used in the                 Transaction ("Location Data"). An IP address is used for the initial processing of a click but after processing is no longer held.
The URL of the Client's Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link is sited ("Client                 URL").
Product identification information for Products via the Geni.us Link the Device was used to click                 ("Product Information").
In addition, GeoRiot may collect the following information from third party sources:
Product information including Product price, genre, name, developer, publisher, and other general                 information published by the Retailer, developer or other third party ("Third Party Product                 Information").
Limited purchase information obtained by the Retailer in the event a Buyer purchases a Product in the                 course of a Transaction, such as the number of products purchased, a list of items (or categories of                 items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the Transaction ("Purchase Information").
Information collected through Geni.us Links is transferred to and stored by GeoRiot in the United States,             according to GeoRiot's standard Data Retention policies.
Geni.us Links may support the following uses of Potential Personal Information, for the benefit of             Clients:
Dynamic Links. A Client can use a single link to route Buyers to the appropriate Retailer                 website based on information such as the user's location, device, and language set in the browser. This                 may include dynamic links on a Client's Digital Property which automatically populates a Storefront                 customized for the Buyer on the Digital Property. For example, a Client website that reviews technology                 devices may display related products with links to purchase them on Retailer Amazon's Storefront. The                 Geni.us Link may be used to ensure the Amazon link that appears on the Client's website is directed                 appropriately based on the Buyer's location.
Automatic Product Localization. A Client can use a single link to automatically route Buyers                 to the appropriate Product in the Buyer's local Storefront, such as the Amazon, iTunes, or Microsoft                 online stores. Automatic affiliation may be used to earn commissions from the correct local Retailer's                 Storefront. For example, a Buyer in Germany may be sent to the Amazon Germany Storefront by a Geni.us                 Link from a Client website, and the Client might earn a commission through the Amazon Germany affiliate                 program.
Choice Pages. A Client may use a link to provide a mobile-optimized landing page where a Buyer                 can view different buying options, rather than having an automated process pick for them.
Retargeting. The Client may use a Geni.us Link to set pixels on behalf of the Client to enable                 collection of Client activity data by third-parties such as Facebook and Google.
Data Analytics. The Data Analytics service provides Clients with marketing content based on                 data identifying the geographical location ("Location Data"), Device data, User Agent Data,                 Language Data and Transactions Data. The Data Analytics service helps Clients ensure that marketing                 efforts are relevant to the Buyer and appropriate to the country or region where the Buyer is located.
While Potential Personal Information may not be Personal Data within the meaning of Privacy Shield and the             E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), as a matter of prudence and due diligence and to help assure transparency, GeoRiot has elected to             attest to its adherence to the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss–U.S. Privacy Shield             Framework. GeoRiot has also implemented policies and procedures to assure its compliance with the E.U.             GDPR to the extent the GDPR applies to Potential Personal Information.              In an effort to minimize the burden on our clients and ourselves, we've stopped storing IP addresses, effective May 9th, 2018, after the initially processing of the click.
4. Collection and Processing of Client Personal Data
When a Client creates a Genius Link account the Client must provide GeoRiot with contact information for an             individual user authorized to use the Genius Link Services and communicate with GeoRiot, either as an             individual Client or on behalf of an organizational Client ("Client Users"). This information may include             Client User name, email addresses and other contact information used to communicate with the Client User, as             well as the content of communications between GeoRiot and the Client User and any transactions the Client             User engages in with GeoRiot.
GeoRiot may use Client Personal Data to communicate with the Client User and with other individuals acting             on behalf of the Client with respect to the Genius Link Services ("Administrative Purposes"), and may use             Client Personal Data to identify and communicate with respect to potential opportunities for the Client to             obtain or use Genius Link Services from GeoRiot, or otherwise promote GeoRiot to the Client and Client User             ("Marketing Purposes"). GeoRiot will not use Client Personal Data for Marketing Purposes unless the Client             or Client User has consented to such use of Client Personal Data.
Client Personal Data is transferred to and stored by GeoRiot in the United States, according to GeoRiot's             standard Data Retention policies.
Client Personal Data is considered Personal Data within the meaning of Privacy Shield and the GDPR. GeoRiot             has elected to attest to its adherence to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss–US Privacy             Shield Framework with respect to Client Personal Data. GeoRiot has also implemented policies and procedures             to assure its compliance with the GDPR with respect to Client Personal Data.
5. GeoRiot as Limited Data Controller and Data Processor
For Privacy Shield and GDPR purposes GeoRiot may be a Data Processor or a             Joint Data Controller with respect to Potential Personal Information subject to this Policy. GeoRiot is a             Data Controller with respect to Client Personal Data subject to this Policy.
For purposes of this Policy a "Data Controller" is a party which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data, while a "Data Processor" is a party which             processes Personal Data on behalf of a Data Controller.
To the extent Privacy Shield and the GDPR apply to Potential Personal Information, for purposes of the             Genius Link Services, GeoRiot and the applicable Client are Joint Data Controllers of Personal Data included             in that Potential Personal Information as follows:
GeoRiot offers Geni.us Links and the Genius Link Services to Clients, with                 pre-established coding and design which determines the information that is collected and the means by                 which information is processed. The Client determines whether to implement Geni.us Link and use the                 Genius Link Services, and by agreement with GeoRiot determines to utilize the information collection                 scope and processing means offered by GeoRiot. All Genius Link Services are provided for the benefit of                 the Client. The Client is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the determination of the scope                 of the information to be collected and the means of its processing.
The Client determines where to site Geni.us Link(s) in the Client's Digital Properties, and the                 purpose(s) for which the information collected will be used (e.g., available Storefronts, implementation                 of routing alternatives, support for commissions, etc.). All Potential Personal Information is processed                 for the benefit of the Client. The Client is therefore the Data Controller with respect to the                 determination of siting of the Geni.us Link(s) and the purposes for which information is collected and                 processed.
GeoRiot determines the retention period for information collected via Geni.us Links. GeoRiot is                 therefore the Data Controller with respect to the retention of the Potential Personal Information.
GeoRiot alone controls the processing of Client Personal Data and is therefore the Data Controller with             respect to such information.
6. Provision of Notice to Buyers
This Policy is published to provide notice of GeoRiot's data collection and privacy practices to             individuals including Buyers. However, GeoRiot does not typically interact directly with individuals, since             its presence on its Clients' Digital Properties is limited to the Geni.us Link(s) in/on the Client's Digital             Properties. GeoRiot therefore contractually requires its Clients to ensure their compliance with any legal             requirements for notification to and consent by individuals with respect to their data collection and use             practices, as required in their applicable jurisdictions.
In addition, GeoRiot contractually requires its Clients to comply with the             Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct where it is applicable to their business. In particular, if a             Client attempts to combine PII or Personal Data from other sources with Potential Personal Information, it             is required to notify the affected individuals and obtain their opt-in consent in accordance with the NAI             Code of Conduct. If a Client collects data for interest-based advertising, it is required to clearly and             conspicuously post a notice consistent with the NAI Code that contains:
A statement that data may be collected for interest-based advertising;
A description of types of data that are collected for interest-based advertising purposes;
An explanation of how, and for what purpose, the data collected will be used or transferred to third                 parties; and
A conspicuous link to an opt-out mechanism.
If GeoRiot should intentionally collect Personal Information directly from individuals for any other             reason, GeoRiot will conform to the same standards.
a. Collection of Potential Personal Information
GeoRiot principally collects information through transactions that occur as part of "Link             Localization." In this process a Geni.us Link which promotes or sells a product is posted on a Client's             Digital Property, and automatically points to a Retailer's online Storefront designated by the Client. When             a Buyer clicks the Geni.us Link, Potential Personal Information is collected and transmitted to GeoRiot's             servers. This information is automatically analyzed to identify the location and type of Device being used             to access the link. Based on this information, the Geni.us Link automatically redirects the Device to a web             page in regional or country-specific storefront of the Retailer ("Localized Page") which promotes             or sells the product.
GeoRiot does not create or administer either its Clients' Digital Properties or Retailers' Storefront             pages, does not provide content for either, and does not sell or promote products on either. The only             information GeoRiot collects from either the Digital Property or the Storefront is that provided in response             to the click on the Genius Link.
GeoRiot may collect and process the following information from the Device used to click on the Geni.us             Link:
User Agent Information which identifies the                 Device, operating system and browser used by the Device in use. User Agent Information is treated as if                 it were Potential Personal Information.
Location Information, which is the IP address of the Device used in the Transaction. The IP address                 provides network information, which can often be used to determine the country, state and sometimes city                 and postal code where the Device is in use. Location Information is treated as if it were Potential                 Personal Information.
Language Information, which is the language associated with the Device's browser. Language Information                 is not treated as Personal Data.
The Client URL, which is the URL of the Client's Digital Property on which the originating Geni.us Link                 is sited. The Client URL is not treated as Personal Data.
Product Information, which is identification information for Products the Device was used to view.                 Product Information is not treated as Personal Data.
Limited Purchase Information such as the number of products purchased, a list of items (or categories                 of items), purchase prices, and timestamp of the Transaction ("Limited Purchase Information"). Limited                 Purchase Information is collected and provided to GeoRiot by Clients, who are responsible for ensuring                 that any individual consent or authorization required for GeoRiot to use it has been obtained. Limited                 Purchase Information is treated as if it were Potential Personal Information.
Third Party Product Information including Product price, genre, name, developer, publisher, and other                 general information published by the Retailer, developer or other third party. Third Party Product                 Information is not treated as Personal Data.
GeoRiot does not collect any other information that might be considered, or might be used to derive, an             individual's Personal Data, sensitive or otherwise.
GeoRiot's Genius Link Services are only offered with respect to individuals who are 18 years of age or             older. GeoRiot does not knowingly collect or maintain any PII or Personal Data from individuals who are             under 13 years of age, and no aspect of the Genius Link Services is designed to attract people under the age             of 13. If GeoRiot obtains knowledge that a Buyer is under the age of 13, GeoRiot will remove Potential             Personal Information with respect to that individual from its databases.
b. Use and Retention of Potential Personal Information by GeoRiot
GeoRiot may use Potential Personal Information it obtains as follows:
For purposes of Link Localization, to redirect Consumers from digital properties to appropriate                 Storefronts.
For purposes of Data Analytics, to create reports of Client marketing activities using Genius Link                 links. Reports include aggregated information about matters including click trends, geographic                 information, sales and commissions data, separately or in combination, based on Data collected by                 GeoRiot. Reports may be filtered based on specified parameters (e.g. number of clicks per day per                 specific location; clicks from specific referrers or from Devices using specific Software; etc.).
For purposes of Data Analytics, in aggregated data sets to support specific marketing strategies and                 Product and advertising content offerings, based on mashups of various types of data with different                 Transactions.
For purposes of GeoRiot's internal management and administration, and fulfillment of its legal                 responsibilities or protection of its legal interests.
Subject to Section 6(c), below, Potential Personal Data may be retained by GeoRiot for any period that GeoRiot             determines is necessary to ensure compliance with its legal responsibilities or protection of its legal             interests, according to GeoRiot's Data Retention policies, except that the IP Address is only processed during             the initial click on a Geni.us Link and is not stored after such processing.
c. Buyer Choice with Respect to Potential Personal Information
The Potential Personal Information GeoRiot maintains after processing a Geni.us Link click is limited to             User Agent Information, Language Information, Client URL, Product Information, Limited Purchase Information             and Third Party Product Information. The only information maintained by GeoRiot which might in principle             allow identification of an individual Buyer is User Agent Information and Limited Purchase information,             which would have to be combined with other information from third parties which is not available to GeoRiot             in order to allow identification of an individual Buyer.
GeoRiot therefore can only provide a Buyer with an opportunity to exercise choice with respect to their             Personal Data included in Potential Personal Information if the Buyer can provide GeoRiot with additional             information regarding the Buyer's association with specific User Agent Information and/or Limited Purchase             Information for GeoRiot to identify the Buyer with specific Potential Personal Information in GeoRiot's             control, with a reasonably high degree of reliability. In the event a Buyer provides such information,             GeoRiot will provide the opportunity to opt-in before any Personal Data included in Potential Personal             Information associated with the Buyer is disclosed to a third party other than one disclosed in this Policy,             or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or as otherwise             permitted or authorized by the Buyer.
For additional information and to request the opportunity to opt-in, please email GeoRiot here .
GeoRiot may retain Device information that is subject to a Buyer's disclosure opt-in accordance with             GeoRiot's Data Retention Policy. The purpose of retaining such information is for GeoRiot's internal             management and administration or for fulfillment of its legal responsibilities or protection of its legal             interests. Residual User Agent information may also remain within databases, access logs, and other             records.
GeoRiot does not collect, use or disclose sensitive information, which is defined as personal information             specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or             philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual. In             the event GeoRiot should do so, GeoRiot will give Buyer's an explicit opt-in choice if their sensitive             information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for             which it was originally collected or as authorized by the individual.
d. Accountability for Onward Transfer of Potential Personal Information
GeoRiot may disclose or provide Potential Personal Information to third parties as follows:
To a Client for purposes of Data Analytics, as part of aggregated data in a report or data set.
To a subsidiary or affiliated company of GeoRiot, subject to their compliance with this Privacy                 Policy.
To a third-party services provider, such as a hosting or analysis service or a security consulting                 firm, for purposes of GeoRiot's internal management and administration or fulfillment of its legal                 responsibilities or protection of its legal interests, subject to contractual requirements for                 protection of the information consistent with this policy and Privacy Shield requirements.
To governmental authorities or their legal designees, if required by applicable law.
In the cases of a client using an affiliate program with the Genius Link Services, GeoRiot may share                 client and account information with affiliate program's account management teams in order to ensure                 compliance with the affiliate program.
GeoRiot will not transfer Personal Data to a third-party Data Controller without the consent of the             individuals, and before doing so, will enter into a contract with the Data Controller that provides:
That the Potential Personal Information may only be processed for purposes consistent with such                 consents.
That the Data Controller will provide the level of protection required for Personal Data required under                 Privacy Shield.
That the Data Controller will notify GeoRiot if the Data Controller makes a determination that it can                 no longer meet this obligation.
That the Data Controller will cease processing the Potential Personal Information or take other                 reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate in case of such a determination.
Consent of the Buyer is not required when GeoRiot discloses Potential Personal Information to a third party that is             acting as an agent to perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of GeoRiot, such as a Data             Processor. In the event of such a disclosure, GeoRiot will:
Identify the purposes for which it is transferring such information.
Ensure that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is                 required under Privacy Shield.
Take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the Potential                 Personal Information transferred in a manner consistent with GeoRiot's obligations under Privacy                 Shield.
Require the agent to notify GeoRiot if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its                 obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required under Privacy Shield
Require the agent upon notice, including notice based on a determination the agent can no longer meet                 its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required under Privacy Shield, to take                 reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.
GeoRiot will provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract             with any such agent to the U.S. Department of Commerce upon request.
GeoRiot will remain responsible for the processing of Potential Personal Information it transfers to an             agent acting on its behalf, and will be liable if the agent processes such Potential Personal Information             in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield unless GeoRiot proves that it is not responsible for the             event giving rise to the damage, if any.
e. Buyer Access to Potential Personal Information
The Potential Personal Information GeoRiot maintains after processing a Geni.us Link click is limited to             User Agent Information, Language Information, Client URL, Product Information, Limited Purchase Information             and Third Party Product Information. The only information maintained by GeoRiot which might in principle             allow identification of an individual Buyer is User Agent Information and Limited Purchase information,             which would have to be combined with other information from third parties which is not available to GeoRiot             in order to allow identification of an individual Buyer.
GeoRiot therefore can only provide a Buyer with an opportunity to review and request that GeoRiot update or             delete their Personal Data included in Potential Personal Information if the Buyer can provide GeoRiot with             additional information regarding the Buyer's association with specific User Agent Information and/or Limited             Purchase Information for GeoRiot to identify the Buyer with specific Potential Personal Information in             GeoRiot's control, with a reasonably high degree of reliability. In the event a Buyer provides such             information, GeoRiot will upon request allow them to review and request that GeoRiot update or delete             Potential Personal Information to the extent the information can be identified to the individual Buyer or is             identifiable to a specific Device used by the Buyer for the Transaction(s) for which the information was             collected.
For additional information and to request the opportunity to review and request update or deletion, please             email GeoRiot here .
f. Security
GeoRiot maintains reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect             Potential Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and             destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Potential             Personal Information. However, GeoRiot cannot guarantee that these safeguards will not be penetrated or             compromised or that all information will remain secure under all circumstances.
g. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
GeoRiot will take reasonable steps to ensure that Potential Personal Information is accurate, complete,             current, and reliable for its intended use, and to ensure that it does not process Potential Personal             Information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it was collected unless authorized by             the Buyer. GeoRiot will take reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that it does not retain             Potential Personal Information which may identify an individual only for as long as is consistent with the             purposes for which it was collected.
h. Disclosures for Law Enforcement and National Security Purposes
GeoRiot may be required to disclose Potential Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public             authorities with appropriate jurisdiction, including to meet national security or law enforcement             requirements, if require by applicable law.
7. Provision of Notice to Client Users
This Policy is also published to provide notice of GeoRiot's data collection and privacy practices to             Client Users. GeoRiot interacts directly with Client Users in the course of account registration and             communications and transactions with respect to the Genius Link Services.
a. Collection of Client Personal Data
When a Client creates a GeoRiot account it must provide GeoRiot with contact information for individual             users authorized to use the Genius Link Services and communicate with GeoRiot as or on behalf of a Client             ("Client Users"). This information may include Client User name, email addresses, and potentially other             information used to communicate with the Client User, as well as the content of communications between             GeoRiot and the Client User and any transactions the Client User engages in with GeoRiot.
b. Use and Retention of Client Personal Data
GeoRiot may use Client Personal Data to communicate with the Client User and with other individuals acting             on behalf of the Client with respect to the Genius Link Services, and may use Client Personal Data to             identify and communicate with respect to potential opportunities for the Client to obtain or use Genius Link             Services from GeoRiot, or otherwise promote GeoRiot to the Client and Client User. GeoRiot will not use             Client Personal Data for marketing or promotional purposes unless the Client or Client User has consented to             such uses of Client Personal Data.
GeoRiot may also use Client Personal Data for purposes of GeoRiot's internal management and administration,             and fulfillment of its legal responsibilities or protection of its legal interests.
Subject to Section 7(c), Client Personal Data may be retained by GeoRiot for any period during which the             Client maintains an active account with GeoRiot, plus any additional period GeoRiot determines is necessary             to ensure compliance with its legal responsibilities or protection of its legal interests, according to             GeoRiot's standard data retention policies.
c. Client User Choice with Respect to Potential Personal Information
GeoRiot will provide Client Users the opportunity to opt-in if their Client Personal Data is to be             disclosed to a third party other than one disclosed in this Policy, or used for a purpose incompatible with             the purpose for which it was originally collected or as otherwise permitted or authorized by the Client             User.
A Client User may request to opt-out of any previously authorized or permitted disclosure of Client             Personal Data information by GeoRiot, except disclosure to the Client with which the Client User is             associated, by emailing us here . In order to opt-out             GeoRiot may require the Client's approval, if the Client is not the same as the Client User.
GeoRiot may retain Client Personal Data that is subject to a Client User's disclosure opt-out in accordance             with GeoRiot's Data Retention Policy. The purpose of retaining such information is for GeoRiot's internal             management and administration or fulfillment of its legal responsibilities or protection of its legal             interests. GeoRiot is not responsible for updating or removing Client Personal Data disclosed to third             parties before the Client User's opt-out.
GeoRiot does not collect, use or disclose sensitive information, which is defined as personal information             specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or             philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information specifying the sex life of the individual. In             the event GeoRiot should do so, GeoRiot will give Client Users an explicit opt-in choice if their sensitive             information is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for             which it was originally collected or as authorized by the individual.
d. Accountability for Onward Transfer of Client Personal Data
GeoRiot may disclose or provide Client Personal Data to third parties as follows:
To the Client with which the Client User is associated, if applicable, for any purpose.
To a subsidiary or affiliated company of GeoRiot, subject to their compliance with this Privacy                 Policy.
To a third-party services provider, such as a hosting or analysis service or a security consulting                 firm, for purposes of GeoRiot's internal management and administration or fulfillment of its legal                 responsibilities or protection of its legal interests, subject to contractual requirements for                 protection of the information consistent with this policy and Privacy Shield requirements.
To governmental authorities or their legal designees, if required by applicable law.
GeoRiot will not transfer Client Personal Data to a third-party Data Controller without the consent of the             individuals, and will first enter into a contract with Data Controller that provides:
That the Client Personal Data may only be processed for purposes consistent with such consents.
That the Data Controller will provide the level of protection required for Personal Data required under                 Privacy Shield.
That the Data Controller will notify GeoRiot if the Data Controller makes a determination that it can                 no longer meet this obligation.
That the Data Controller will cease processing the Client Personal Data or takes other reasonable and                 appropriate steps to remediate in case of such a determination.
Consent of the Client User is not required when GeoRiot discloses Client Personal Data to a third party that is acting as an             agent to perform task(s) on behalf of and under the instructions of GeoRiot, such as a Data Processor. In             the event of such a disclosure, GeoRiot will:
Identify the purposes for which it is transferring such information.
Ensure that the agent is obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is                 required under Privacy Shield.
Take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the Client                 Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with GeoRiot's obligations under Privacy Shield.
Require the agent to notify GeoRiot if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its                 obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required under Privacy Shield
Require the agent upon notice, including notice based on a determination the agent can no longer meet                 its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required under Privacy Shield, to take                 reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.
GeoRiot will provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its contract             with any such agent to the U.S. Department of Commerce upon request.
GeoRiot will remain responsible for the processing of Client Personal Data it transfers to an agent acting             on its behalf, and will be liable if the agent processes such Client Personal Data in a manner inconsistent             with the Privacy Shield unless GeoRiot proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the             damage, if any.
e. Client User Access to Potential Personal Information
GeoRiot provides Client Users with the opportunity to review and request that GeoRiot update or delete             Client Personal Data. Modification or deletion of Client Personal Data may be subject to Client notice and             approval. To access this information, email us here .

GeoRiot maintains reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect             Client Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction,             taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Client Personal Data.             However, GeoRiot cannot guarantee that these safeguards will not be penetrated or compromised or that all             information will remain secure under all circumstances.
g. Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

GeoRiot will             take reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that it does not retain Client Personal Data which may             identify an individual only for as long as is consistent with the purposes for which it was collected.
h. Disclosures for Law Enforcement and National Security Purposes

GeoRiot provides assurance of its compliance with this Policy by conducting internal assessments of its             relevant practices internally. In the event such an assessment finds non-compliant privacy, corrective             action plans will be developed to resolve the identified gaps in compliance, as well as preventive action             plans to maintain compliance.
Any employee GeoRiot finds has violated this Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and             including termination of employment.
