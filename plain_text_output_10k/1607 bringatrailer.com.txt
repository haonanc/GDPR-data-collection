Information We Collect
We gather two categories of information: (1) information provided by visitors to the Service when they complete an online form or enter information regarding themselves and/or their vehicle(s) (2) information we collect by using technology when visitors use our website.

Users can always refuse to supply personally identifiable information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.

Personally Identifiable Information is any information used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information.

For example, if you access our Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook, by “following,” “liking,” adding the BaTMedia application, linking your account to the BaTMedia Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to BaTMedia. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account, any information you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to BaTMedia’s Service.

A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. The device identifier information that we collect does not itself collect or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information to us, however, a device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute Personally Identifiable Information.
