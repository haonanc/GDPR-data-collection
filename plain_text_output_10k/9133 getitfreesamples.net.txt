Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy has been created so that you, as a user of this website, understand how the data that you submit to us is handled.
Your Email Address
We do not use your email address for anything other than:
* To confirm that you are an actual person during the registration process.
* To respond to a query or comment that you have submitted to us.
* To inform you of a comment on one of the campsites that you have submitted.
Your email address is NEVER seen by a third party. You will receive emails when someone comments on a campsite that you have submitted. This is an automated process and the commenter does not have access to your email address.
At this time, we do not send out mailings to our users. If we ever do, you will have the ability to opt out.

We use cookies to save your preferences and login information, and provide personalized functionality. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings, but be aware that this will disable some of the functionality on the website. More information about cookies can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie .
