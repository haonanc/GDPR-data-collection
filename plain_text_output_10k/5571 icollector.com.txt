However, all customer service related enquiries are handled by the icollector.com customer services team at support@icollector.com whereby personally identifying information such as your email address may be disclosed by yourselves in order to answer your enquiry.

Such personally identifying information could include your name, email address, home address, phone number, fax number and credit card information.

We have designed absentee bidding on Auction Catalogs so that no personal identifying information is displayed online or is accessible to the general public. In absentee bidding, your bids are not disclosed as it is a 'closed bidding' system.
The only time any personal identifiable information is released is when you submit an absentee bid on an item in an auction house sale.
