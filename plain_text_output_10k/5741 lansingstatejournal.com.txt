Collection and Use of Information
Registration on this site is voluntary, and is designed for the purpose of seeking                     employment. Upon registration the site collects your email address and other personal                     information (such as employment skills) in a "profile."

We also collect information                     about how you use our site and the areas of our site that you visit.

Your email address                     is required, however, so that you may be contacted for employment opportunities,                     or in case we need to contact you regarding site changes or information about your                     account.

In order to provide you with the broadest exposure to potential employment                     opportunities, information you place in your profile may be shared with PandoLogic                     affiliated companies or within other sites powered by PandoLogic.

However, WE DO NOT AND CAN NOT guarantee that other parties (including parties disguised                     as employers) will not gain access to this database. Therefore, PandoLogic and                     Lansing State Journal                     hereby specifically exclude any responsibility and or liability related to the use                     made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable                     database.

We also share information where legally required. Information collected on our Sites                     is stored in whole or in part in the United States, and may be subject to U.S. law.                     We may disclose and transfer information if our business is sold or acquired. We                     may disclose NON-PII (non-personally identifiable information) aggregate statistics                     regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our site and emails                     to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic                     reports, which do not describe or identify any individual user.

Google Analytics and Display Advertising
We have updated our Google Analytics tracking code to support Google Display Advertising                      through the Remarketing feature. This enables Google Analytics to collect data about your                      traffic via the DoubleClick cookie in addition to data collected through the standard Google                      Analytics implementation. Display Advertising lets us enable features in Analytics that aren’t                      available through standard implementations.
The Remarketing feature allows third-party vendors, including Google, to show your ads on                      sites across the Internet. In this regard, We as well as third-party vendors, including Google,                      use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies together                      to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to your website.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network                      ads using the Ads Preferences Manager available here .
