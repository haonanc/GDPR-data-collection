You may opt out of receiving these types of emails by unsubscribing or emailing us at support_at_outdoorproject.com.
We will not share your personal information outside of Outdoor Project unless you have consented to having your personal information shared with a company that is not affiliated with us. If we do share your personal information with another company not affiliated with us, that information is subject to that company’s privacy policies. However, we may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances where it is necessary to enforce our Terms of Use or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires us to do so.
We also use your personal information to contact you with Outdoor Project newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or via the “My Account” section of the Site. (See “Changing or Deleting Information” below.)
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (together, “Promotions”) through the Site. If you decide to participate, we will request some personal information from you. Participation in these Promotions is completely voluntary and you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use this information to administer your participation in each Promotion.
