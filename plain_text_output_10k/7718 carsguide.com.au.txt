Registration Information is the information you provide to Company in the course of registering for or acquiring a Company Service, for example, to create an account, submit an enquiry, become a subscriber, become an advertiser, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a competition.  Registration Information may include, for example, name, delivery or postal address, phone numbers, email address, gender and birthday.  It includes additional information which you provide to Company in the course of that relationship such as purchase interests, price range, the type and details of your enquiries, account preferences and transaction history.  Where possible you may have the option of interacting with us anonymously (for example when browsing our digital products as a casual user) or using a pseudonym.  We will usually make it clear whenever this is an option.
Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that you post to the Company Services and the information about you that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, tweets, status, profile information and picture(s).  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.
