If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself through    an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the information as    long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of    the communication.
However, all communications addressed to the HHS Secretary or the HHS Webmaster    are maintained, as required by law, for historical purposes. These    communications are archived on a monthly basis, but are also protected by the    Privacy Act which restricts our use of them, yet permits certain disclosures.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to    all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify    unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause    damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant    to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to    help identify an individual.
Systems of Records
Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be submitted    electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and information updates    about eligibility benefits. Electronically submitted information is maintained    and destroyed pursuant to the Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be    subject to the Privacy Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a    Privacy Act system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided.
