In addition to the other uses set forth in this Policy, we may disclose and otherwise use             Personally Identifiable Information as described below.
Affiliates. We share your Personally Identifiable Information with our affiliates  â€” companies that control, are             controlled by, or are under common control with TheSoul Publishing Ltd.
Our Partners. We allow third parties, including carefully selected ad networks and business partners (referred to as             "Our Partners"), to display advertising on our Website. Our Partners may, for instance, collect, use and share your             information to make or help us make predictions about your interests, and may provide you with offers, promotional             materials, and advertisements. In addition, Our Partners may be collecting certain information related to your PC,             laptop, mobile phone or other device attributes and traffic/session information. Our Website permits Our Partners             to collect your Personally Identifiable Information to provide personalized advertising to you. Our Partners are             leading digital performance-based advertising groups which put great effort in making sure that your personal             information is safe and used properly.
If you would like to find out more about personalized advertising and your choices to opt-out of receiving personalised ads,             click http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp
Service Providers. Your information may be collected by entities that provide services to us, including companies             that deliver web analytics, data processing, data enhancement and customer insights, advertising, email distribution,             and other services.
Other Parties  (when required by law or as necessary to protect our services). We may disclose your information             (including Personally Identifiable Information) to other parties in order to:
protect our legal rights or property, the legal rights or property of our affiliates, and sites or services we
protect the rights, safety and security of our users, ourselves, or any other person or entity;
prevent fraud (or for risk management purposes);
in order to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by                 a governmental or supervisory authority, whether or not legally required.
Other Parties (in connection with transfer of assets). If we make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved             in a merger or transfer (or due diligence related to such a transaction), or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, we             may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information as part of that transaction.
Use for Analytical and Ad Serving Purposes. We use standard tools common within the industry, such as Google             Analytics, to collect information about use of our Website. These tools collect information such as how often you             visit our Website and what other sites you visited prior to reaching our Website. We use the information we obtain             from analytical tools for the purposes of improving our Website. The analytical tools collect only the IP address             assigned to your computer or other device and your browser settings as of the moment you visit our Website, rather             than your name or other identifying information.
We also use standard tools common within the industry, such as DoubleClick for Publishers operated by Google,             enabling placement and management of personalized advertising services on our Website. These tools use cookies             to target advertising based on what is relevant to you as a user to improve advertising and to avoid showing ads that             you have already seen. Cookies themselves contain no Personally Identifiable Information. They relate to your web             activity, rather than your identity. Tools such as DoubleClick will send a cookie to your web browser after any             impression, click, or other activity by you on our servers. If your web browser accepts the cookie, the cookie will be             planted on your web browser. DoubleClick will usually send a cookie to your web browser when you visit any             webpage displaying DoubleClick ads. Webpages containing DoubleClick ads include ad tags that instruct web             browsers to request ad content from our servers. When the server delivers the ad content, it will also send a cookie.
Finally, our Website relies on common industry tools Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google             Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These tools help us understand the composition of viewers of our             Website in terms of gender, age and interests. We need this information in order to understand what kinds of             creative content we need to develop to suit the interests of different demographic and interest groups. Our Partners may need this information to develop marketing content. You may, at any time, opt out of Google Analytics tracking,             including Google Display Network Impression Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting,             by installing the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On .             You may also opt out of ad serving through Googleâ€™s opt-out page .
The personal data privacy aspects of all Google products, services and features, including Google Analytics and             DoubleClick, are covered by Google Privacy Policy .             We never combine the information collected through the use of             Google Analytics or DoubleClick with any other Personally Identifiable Information. Please note that permanent             cookies planted on your web browser by Google products to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit             our Website, cannot be used by anyone but Google. The ability of Google to use and share information collected by             Google Analytics or DoubleClick about your visits to our Website is restricted by DoubleClick Terms and Conditions , Google Analytics Terms of Use and Google Privacy Policy .
Please note that you can opt out of ads personalization using Googleâ€™s Ads Settings by following the instructions             contained on the following resource of Google â€“ Google Ads Settings .             If you choose to opt out of ads personalization, you will no longer receive personalized advertising.
Cross-Border Transfer of Information
We generally maintain centralized servers and systems in Europe and may maintain servers and systems elsewhere.             These servers and systems are managed by us or on our behalf, or by our affiliates located in Europe.
In the event of transfer and processing of your Personally Identifiable Information outside the EEA for the purposes             described above, we will ascertain that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within             the EEA, including when entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU Commission approved Standard             Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU-US Privacy Shield.
How Secure Is Your Information
We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personally             Identifiable Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in             accordance with requirements of applicable laws.
Use of â€˜Cookiesâ€™
We also use (or may use) â€˜cookiesâ€™ when you visit our Website. For more information on our use of cookies, please             refer to our Cookie Policy.
Use of Information for Personal Advertising
The information collected by Our Partners is used to analyze trends, understand user activities and gather             demographic information to enable, manage and develop their personalized ads and related services. Our Partners             may share such information with their affiliates. To do this, Our Partners use technologies such as cookies and web             beacons to collect information about your interaction with our Website and third-party websites. This type of             information does not identify you personally and, typically, is aggregated with other data to create segments â€“             groups of users and general interest categories that are inferred based on a range of factors (for example, "sports             fan"). Our Partners use this information to form a more accurate picture of the interests of the audiences with which             they interact â€“ including you â€“ so that their ads are more relevant to those interests.
In addition, Our Partners may use the information collected from these types of cookie or similar technologies for a             variety of other purposes, including:
in conjunction with advertising that appears on other third-party websites;
to measure the effectiveness of web-based and email advertisements;
for reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement data and other interaction with ads and the websites on which they are served.
Our Partners retain your information in accordance with their legitimate business purposes for processing.             Thereafter, the information is removed, archived for restricted legitimate interests, or anonymized. Non-identifying             information may be kept without time and use limitations.
Retention of Information
If you reside or are located in the EEA, your Personally Identifiable Information will be stored for no longer than             necessary for the purpose for which the Personally Identifiable Information was collected. The length of time             Personally Identifiable Information is retained depends on the purpose for which such information was collected             and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.
Your Legal Rights
You have certain rights in relation to your Personally Identifiable Information.             Depending on the jurisdiction, you have the right to request that we:

provide your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party provider or services;
provide you with a copy of any Personally Identifiable Information which we hold about you.

If you are under 16 years of             age (unless a lower age threshold between 13 and 16 applies in your country), then please do not use or access this             Website, or ask your parents for permission before using our Website or sending any information about yourself to             anyone over the Internet. We will take appropriate steps to delete any Personally Identifiable Information of persons             less than 13 years of age that has been collected on our Website without verifiable parental consent upon learning             of the existence of such Personally Identifiable Information.

If you reside or are located within the EEA, you may also make a complaint to             the supervisory authority for data protection in your country of residence (such as, for instance, the UK Information             Commissionerâ€™s Office for the UK) or seek a remedy through local courts if you believe that your rights have been             breached.
