Firstly, ‘personal information’ in our Privacy Policy has the same meaning as in the Privacy Act, namely it means information about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.
The type of personal information we collect will vary depending upon whether you are a retail or wholesale customer. If you are a wholesale customer, we may collect and hold various types of personal information about you including your name, date of birth, phone number (landline or mobile), address, email address, occupation, financial information and other information about you which we need in order to conduct our business and / or provide you with our goods and products.
If you are a retail customer and ordering on our website, we need to know information such as your name, email address, billing address, phone number and credit card number. We need this information so we can process and fill your order and contact you if we have any questions. Please note we do not store credit card details.
Now and then, we may conduct surveys, run competitions or other promotions. If you choose to participate in one of our surveys or competitions, we'll probably ask for some personal information such as your shopping habits, email address and other information so that we can run the promotion and notify you if you win.
When you send us a request, such as to our customer service department, we may ask you to identify yourself by name or email address in order to send you a response, if appropriate.
When signing up to our emails we may also request additional information such as your date of birth, gender, postcode and products that you are interested in. This information helps us to tailor our emails to suit your individual shopping preferences.
The Privacy Act also protects your sensitive information. If we need to obtain this type of information, we will ask for your consent, except where otherwise permitted by law.
It may not be practical for us to deal with you if you have not identified yourself or you are using a pseudonym.
 
How we collect and hold personal information
If it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect personal information directly from you.
We may also need to collect personal information from other sources including from:
third parties;
our website (see below for details about how our website may use ‘cookies’ and record information of those who visit it); and
publicly available sources of information (such as social media).
We will only collect personal information from you by lawful and fair means. We may also collect, use and exchange your information in other ways where permitted by law.
We will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we collect, in both paper and electronic form, from misuse and loss as well as from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure.
Reasonable steps include:
We confirm the identity of any individual wishing to access personal information;
In order to make every effort to ensure that your experience at Conquest is secure, we use encryption technology to protect you against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. When you access your account or complete any forms on the website, a secure server encrypts all of your information through the use of Secure Socket Layers (SSLs). SSLs lock all information passed from you to us using a 256 bit encryption making it extremely difficult for this information to be deciphered;
We ensure that only staff members who need your personal information in order to do deal with you, do business with you or answer your requests are given access to it. Our employees are provided with training and information regarding the proper handling of personal information. All information stored in our computer system is protected from unauthorised access and information that is stored in document form is kept in secure locations to prevent access by unauthorised persons; and
 
How does Conquest use cookies and pixel tags?
We collect visitor information by using cookies and pixel tags. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website can send to your browser and may then be stored on your computer's hard drive to help our site recognise you when you return to our website. It acts as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer, but not you personally. Cookies are used as a standard practice by most websites.
Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies; you can usually change your browser settings to refuse cookies, but if you do so you may experience difficulties while shopping online.
 
We collect information using “cookies” and other tracking technologies for the following reasons:
to help us monitor the performance of our website so that we can improve the operation of the website and the services we offer; and
to provide personalised services to each user of our website to make their navigation through our website easier and more rewarding to the user.
The purposes for which we collect, hold, use and disclose personal information
We will only collect, hold, use and disclose personal and sensitive information when it is reasonably necessary for us as a business to have that information in order to carry out our activities and functions. These activities and functions include:
delivering and supplying our goods/ products and services to you;
employing staff;
contracting and dealing with suppliers and sub consultants, partners and clients;
dealing with service providers, retailers and traders;
consulting to, with and for anyone necessary to deliver our products and services;
achieving our firm / business objectives;
sending information, correspondence and news about our company and our products and services; and
handling privacy complaints and issues.
 
Does Conquest share this information with anyone else?
We may share your personal information with our related entities and/or our associated businesses including Authentics Australia Pty Ltd and its affiliates and related entities and with members of the Converse Group. We may also share your information with our associated trusted third party service providers. These third parties provide specific services and administer activities offered at our website. For example; customer service and credit card processing. These third parties are not authorised to discuss, disclose or make any use of your personal information except as necessary to provide such services.
We, or our third party service providers, may disclose specific individual information if we or they reasonably believe that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or to protect the interests of Conquest, our business partners, affiliates, guests or our third party service providers.
