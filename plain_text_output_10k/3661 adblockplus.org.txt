This information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also nicknames and information in your forum posts.
What is the purpose of data processing and what is the legal basis?

This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time. The respective current version is available at: https://adblockplus.org/privacy .
Collection and processing in our products
Adblock Plus extensions
When you use the Adblock Plus browser extension, we collect and process the following data:
Extension update checks
Your browser periodically checks for updates of all your extensions, including Adblock Plus. Some general information - browser version, extension version, operating system, date of last update and your IP address - are transmitted during an update check. Updates for Adblock Plus for Android and Internet Explorer are handled by the Adblock Plus website and the data transmitted is subject to the Adblock Plus Privacy Policy . Updates to Adblock Plus for Firefox are handled by the Mozilla website and are subject to the Mozilla's Privacy Policy . Updates to Adblock Plus for Chrome are handled by the Google Web Store website and are subject to the Google Privacy Policy . Updates to Adblock Plus for Opera are handled by the Opera Add-ons website and are subject to the Opera Privacy Policy . Updates to Adblock Plus for Safari are handled by the Safari Extensions website and are subject to the Apple Privacy Policy .
Subscription downloads
If you add filter subscriptions to your Adblock Plus installation, the subscription will be requested to regularly retrieve updates. Every update results in the hosting website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser and browser version.
Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated address of the filter list is requested from the AdblockPlus.org domain. The data transmitted includes the Adblock Plus version, subscription address and any information about the error encountered. This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by subscription maintainers and is subject to this Privacy Policy .
Issue Reporter
Adblock Plus allows you to send issue reports that will be temporarily stored on the AdblockPlus.org. These reports contain information required to investigate the issue including the Adblock Plus version, browser version, address of the web page where the problem is visible, blockable items on the web page, matching filters and active subscriptions. Parameter values are removed from all transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information. It is also possible to provide additional information on a voluntary basis, which may be privacy-sensitive:
A website screenshot provides a scaled-down and color-reduced version of the page viewed. It is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before the report is sent.
The email address is only used to request more information or to update the user on the issue.
Access to the reports
The processed reports can only be accessed by an individual who knows their unique ID. These IDs are only shared with:
Maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in the report, as EasyList authors, who are not employed at eyeo.
Certain members of eyeo’s filter list team. eyeo will use the reports for troubleshooting and support monitoring purposes only.
Emergency notification
Adblock Plus contains an emergency notification mechanism that allows it to notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation. This feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications. This request makes your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser, browser version and the number of previous Adblock Plus downloads (the download number is limited to four, and will be displayed as 4+ after reaching this number). This data allows serving different notifications to different clients and is subject to this Privacy Policy .
Further requests
Adblock Plus may make further requests to AdblockPlus.org as required. For example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs to be downloaded. These requests are subject to this Privacy Policy .
Data retention
Data related to subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications, Issue Reporter data (as well as the full reports and their associated data) are automatically removed after 30 days. Only a subset of the data will be kept longer. This includes only the country code of users filing an issue (extracted from the IP address) for analytic purposes, which is stored separately from the full reports and cannot be connected to an individual after deletion of the full reports.
Adblock Plus stores some data in the Firefox profile on your computer. Adblock Plus never transmits this data to any servers, but other extensions and services, such as Firefox Sync , may do so. Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise. However, filter hit statistics and recent issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history. Adblock Plus treats this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser; this data isn't stored if you are using private browsing mode and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.
Adblock Browser for Android
Adblock Browser for Android is based on Mozilla's Firefox browser. Some data collection and processing in connection with Adblock Browser for Android are subject to Mozilla's Privacy Policy . Please note that Adblock Browser automatically connects to Mozilla and its service providers to provide security, snippets and other features ( Firefox's Privacy Notice ); and when you ask it to, Adblock Browser also connects to Mozilla to provide you with features such as location services ( Firefox's Privacy Notice ).
Deviating from the description in Firefox's Privacy Notice , Firefox updates are provided under eyeo's control and some features, such as the Firefox Health Report, crash reporting and add-ons, are disabled.
Adblock Browser for iOS
Crash and error reporter
In the event of an unexpected crash or error, Adblock Browser for iOS collects data relevant for analyzing the cause of the malfunction and transmits it to eyeo's HockeyApp account. The data is solely used for individual troubleshooting (as well as for identifying general defects which lead to unexpected crashes or errors) and is never shared with any third parties other than HockeyApp.
During a crash, the following data is sent:
Bundle identifier, bundle version and short bundle version string of Adblock Browser for iOS.
Device type, CPU architecture and version of the operating system.
Timestamp of when the crash happened.
A generated UUID to prevent duplicate crash reports.
If an exception was thrown, the plain-text class name and message value of the exception.

Automatically collected information
Website logs
All requests to our Websites are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address (solely for the purpose of IT security and only accessible by eyeo's IT Security team), the time at which the request was made, the web address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page.

Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the aggregated usage statistics that cannot be connected to a single user remain. Everything else is deleted.
Data retention
The request to our Websites, including your IP address, is stored when you create a forum post, submit a contact form, or add a blog comment. This allows administrators to effectively address spam content and security breaches. All stored requests are deleted after 30 days.
Cookies
Several areas of our Websites use cookies to recognize signed in users or to store settings. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer with the help of your internet browser. Cookies are not evaluated in any other manner and are never used to track Website visitors. If you do not want to enable cookies, you can opt against using them by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Please note that the efficiency and range of eyeo's services may be restricted as a result.

At our website adblock.ai we are automatically collecting the following information:
Facebook messenger integration
We have embedded the Facebook Messenger functionality, owned by Facebook, Inc., into the adblock.ai website to enable you to submit screenshots to our bot (“Adblock AI”) via Messenger, without having to access the Facebook website. Please note that Messenger is hosted by Facebook. We have disabled the function that would otherwise send personal data to Facebook when you access our website; however, when you click on the button to help train Adblock AI with your screenshots (“START NOW”) you will activate Messenger. Only then will some personal data, including IP address, be transferred to Facebook. For more information, please review Facebook's privacy policy .

Information you give to us on a voluntary basis
The Adblock Plus forum and blog are both publicly available to all visitors. If you write a post or comment, we collect and process personal data as follows:
Forum registration
We use personal data you entered during forum registration to form the user's public profile, which is visible to other forum visitors for the purpose that users can associate forum posts with a particular person.
Passwords and email addresses will not be visible to other forum visitors.
Passwords go through one-way encryption before they are stored on the server.
Email addresses are only displayed in the public profile if explicitly agreed to. By default, they are only used for the sending of notifications to which you subscribed.
Note: Registration is not required to participate in the forums and you can delete your account at any time.
Blog comments
When you add a comment on the Adblock Plus blog , you can optionally specify an email address. Unlike the other fields, the email address is never displayed to other visitors and is only used to notify the comment author about replies to their comments, if any.
Email collection
Some of eyeo's Websites host product campaigns that rely on email collection. For example, you can request a link by email to install Adblock Browser on your mobile device. We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email). We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.
Email collection
Data provided by you in connection with our blog and our forum will be retained for the same time as the comment and / or your account exists.
In general, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch). In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch).
