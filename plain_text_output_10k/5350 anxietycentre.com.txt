We only have access to/collect information                 that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact                 from you.

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You                 can do the following at any time by contacting us via the email                 address or phone number given on our website:

Security
We take precautions to protect your information.  When                     you submit sensitive information via the website, your information                     is protected both online and offline.
Wherever we collect sensitive information (such                 as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted                 to us in a secure way.  You can verify this by looking for                 a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking                 for "https" at the beginning of the address of the                 web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information                 transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.                 Only management or personal coaches/counselors/therapists who                 need to collect or process this information for specific functions                 (for example, collecting and reporting this information to management)                 are granted access to personally identifiable information.  The                 computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information                 are kept in a secure environment and are double password protected.
Client Confidentiality
We respect, and therefore, protect the privacy of our members and                 therapy clients. ALL information shared with us or our therapists                 remains confidential and protected, unless specifically requested                 otherwise by the member or client.
Testimonials presented online
Many of the pictures associated with the testimonials we present online are from stock photography                   in order to protect the identity of the individual. With the                   proliferation of identity theft, we don't recommend making                   personal information available online, including personal photographs.                   Some pictures, however, are from actual members or clients because they requested                    to have them posted.
If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy                 policy, you should contact us immediately by telephone at 403-208-0091                 or by email .
Google Tracking
anxietycentre.com uses Google tracking to monitor website traffic                 flow. No personal information is collected, used, or stored during                 this process.
The combination of good self-help information and working with an experienced anxiety disorder coach, counselor, or therapist is the most effective way to address anxiety disorder and its many symptoms. Until the core causes of anxiety are addressed - the underlying factors that motivate apprehensive behavior - a struggle with anxiety disorder can return again and again. Identifying and successfully addressing anxiety's underlying factors is the best way to overcome problematic anxiety.
