This information is collected in order to provide benefits and services to you and to continue to improve and enhance our service offerings. This information may include, but is not limited to, that which you provide voluntarily through your interactions with the site, as well as information about how you use and navigate through the site.
We will not sell, license or transfer personal information we gather from you outside of Florida Blue and its affiliated companies, except as necessary to provide you with information, services or products that we offer independently or jointly with others, as required by law or in connection with judicial or governmental proceedings, or in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of Florida Blue assets or of the assets of a division of Florida Blue.

When communicating personal information through the Florida Blue website, you will be provided with a user identification code (user ID) and a password.

We utilize technical mechanisms such as cookies and pixel tags (also called clear gifs) to gather non-personal site usage information. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.

If you turn off cookies in your browser, however, some portions of our site may not be available to you. Pixel tags are imbedded in the web page and note visits to certain site locations. They may also be used in email communications to note if you have received and opened email communications from us.
Non-Personal Information may also be used by our advertising service providers to support Online Behavioral Advertising, or Interest-based advertising as it is sometimes called.
