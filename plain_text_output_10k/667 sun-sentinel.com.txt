MySunSentinel.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address when you register, subscribe to one of our services, enter contests offered by our site, and at other times. In addition, we automatically collect non-personal information such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, and site usage information, in order to evaluate and improve the performance of our site.
We collect and use information for the specific purposes for which you provide it, such as processing an online registration at your request. We also collect and use information:
to enhance your experience at our site;
to perform site administration and technical support;
to notify you about our new and existing content, events, products or services (e.g., we may invite you to subscribe to our complimentary newsletter/late breaking news/coupons and promotions e-mail program);
to enable you to enter contests and sweepstakes;
to create aggregate information about demographics and usage patterns;
to invite our promotional partners and advertisers – with your explicit permission – to call to your attention special offers, products and services that may be of interest to you.
We may also use third party providers to help us contact you or to support our site and services, and for these limited purposes, we may share your personally identifiable information with our providers. By registering for and/or using our site, you consent to our sharing of your personal information with our third party providers for these limited purposes.
We may disclose personal information when required by law to do so, or at the request of a law enforcement agency. We may also disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to avoid violation of, or interference with, the terms of use of our site or services, or with our proprietary rights, or the rights of third parties
We will not sell, share, or rent this personal information to other third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose personally identifiable information to third parties without your explicit permission, except as disclosed in this policy. Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their personal information used for promotional purposes at the point where we ask for the information. Users who no longer wish to receive such promotional materials may unsubscribe from receiving future e-mail communications from MyOrlandoSentinel.com, by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the e-mail communication.
We may use aggregate information to measure general site usage patterns and characteristics of our user base, and we may include such aggregate information about our audience in reports to our partners or vendors. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics without your permission in order to describe our audience to existing and prospective advertisers or other third parties. However, this aggregate information does not reference names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it is not traceable to a specific recipient or e-mail address.
