Personalized Content and Advertising
Online and Email Analytics
We may use applications, servers and other technology provided by third-party companies, such as Google Analytics , to help us analyze how users use our Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and the location which you are accessing the service. These entities may use cookies and information-gathering tools, such as web beacons or Flash LSO, to perform their services.

Tailored Content and Advertising
We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Services and on third-party websites or other media (e.g. social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content on the page you are visiting, information you provide, your searched, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one.
Users may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies . You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members . Users in the European Union should visit the  opt-out page of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance , or  TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page  to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the  Google Ads Settings page .
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at www.networkadvertising.org .
When using a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system provides its own instructions on how to prevent deliver of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or privacy settings with the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored advertising. You should contact the applicable platform provider for further details of opting out of in-application advertisements. We also may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics.  You can opt-out from third-party interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on ‘Disable ads based on interests.’  You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the Truste Privacy App available at: https://www.truste.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.  We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
