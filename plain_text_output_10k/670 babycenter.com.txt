Introduction and Scope
We respect the privacy of our website vistors and are committed to collecting, maintaining and securing information of our website visitors in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In this Privacy Policy, we (BabyCenter, L.L.C., headquartered in San Francisco, California) describe our privacy practices for babycenter.com, baby.com, pregnancy.com and any other website or service operated by BabyCenter, L.L.C. that displays a direct link to this Privacy Policy (each a "Site" and together the "Sites"). This privacy policy is intended for citizens of the United States. Please read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to the Sites. By submitting information on any of the Sites, you acknowledge that you understand and consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
About Children
The Sites are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via the Sites from visitors in this age group. We do, however, collect information about children and babies from their parents or legal guardians. We ask that our Site visitors not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents' or legal guardiansâ€™ consent. By providing personal information on the Sites regarding a baby or child, you are affirming that you are legally authorized to do so. We encourage parents and legal guardians to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to the Sites or any other web sites.
Information We Collect
We may collect personal information from you to analyze visits to our Site and learn about the interests of our visitors in the aggregate and also on a personal level. We may personalize and customize the Site with references to products or educational information that we believe may be of interest to you based on your previous interactions, information you have provided to us, or information about you that we have collected from third-party sources. Your interests could come from several sources, including your browsing activity and your response to online advertisements. In such circumstances, third parties collect and store data about your interests and online activity.
We collect information from you in several different ways when you interact with our Sites:
Active Information Collection: You actively send information to us when you sign-up as a member on a Site, participate in surveys or promotions, post in our community, respond to us or otherwise contact us. Depending on your choices, you may send us personally identifiable information about yourself and/or your baby(ies) such as your email address, name, mailing address, phone number, birthday, and gender, as well as your baby's due date/birthday, name and gender. Depending on what activity you choose to participate in on our Site, you may be asked for additional information, including health or insurance information. At all times, you determine what information you want to actively share with us. For more information, please see our active information collection summary .
Passive Information Collection: We also collect information about how you use our Sites through web log files, cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels and similar technologies. For a summary of these technologies, please see our passive information collection examples . Additionally, when you visit our Sites from a desktop computer, tablet or mobile device, we may collect certain information about your device such as browser type and version, IP address, location information and device identifier.
We collect information about you because we want to determine what you may like or find interesting and so we can provide you with targeted information and advertising either directly or through one of our advertising partners (on our Site, in newsletters, via email and otherwise). In addition, we use data to create statistics and reports where personally identifiable information has been removed and aggregated (such that it is anonymous with respect to any specific user).
To accomplish some of the foregoing data processing, we utilize independent contractors. Read about examples of some of our contractors and how we work with them.
Use of Cookies
Where permitted by law, non-personally identifiable information and data may be automatically collected through the use of "cookies" or "internet tags" and other similar techniques placed by BabyCenter and third parties. This type of anonymous information allows us to evaluate Site visitor interest and perform other market research activities. Cookies are small text files that a website can use to recognize repeated usage, facilitate a visitor's access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvement and targeted advertising. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that will allow you to deny the cookie feature; however, please note that cookies may be necessary to customize delivery of information to you.
Our Sites use cookies for the following purposes:
Analytics: We use cookies to keep track of browsing patterns and help us analyze your usage of our Sites. This helps us improve our services to you.
Security: Cookies help us authenticate you. For example, when you login to our Site, we set a cookie in your browser so that we can recognize you the next time you visit the Site from the same browser.
Sites/Services: Cookies help us recognize you and store your Site preferences while using our Sites.
Advertising: We use cookies to show you relevant advertising and in some cases, track its effectiveness, while visiting our Site, or other sites.
We can only access the cookies that we have stored in your browser and other organizations can never access the cookies that we have stored.
How We Share Information
We keep your information confidential and we generally do not disclose it. But, please note the following clarifications and exceptions:
Our employees and authorized independent contractors ("authorized personnel") may have access to your personally identifiable information for the purpose of helping us run our business (and not for their own, independent purposes, unless you consent to such use). Authorized personnel access and use such data in accordance with our instructions, on a "need to know" basis, and under defined confidentiality and security obligations.
If we ever sell a Site or substantial parts of our business, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to a (prospective) buyer on the condition that such buyer agrees to comply with this Privacy Policy.
We may share your personally identifiable information to respond to law enforcement requests, court orders or other legal process or if we believe that such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent or respond to illegal activities, fraud, physical threats to you or others or as otherwise required by any applicable law or regulation.
Even though we do not provide any personally identifiable information about you specifically to any advertising customers without your consent, they can occasionally find out information indirectly. For example, we frequently agree on target audiences for particular ads (for example, an advertiser may ask us to send certain information on infant safety products to parents with small children who may be particularly interested). If you choose to respond to such targeted advertisements, the advertiser may deduce that you are a member of the target audience to whom we sent the ad.
If you sign up for our services on a third party website, such third party may know, from you, that you signed up on one or more of the Sites.
Before we disclose your personally identifiable data to a third party for their own business purposes (such as a survey or a sweepstake), we will first obtain your consent, for example via email, click-through, an online opportunity to opt-out or otherwise.
We may share your personally identifiable information with authorized personnel in affiliated companies located in the U.S. or in other countries. At all times, personally identifiable information is treated confidentially.
We freely use and disclose data in anonymous form, for example, in statistics or reports to our advertising customers and partners.
We may partner with third parties to track the effectiveness of advertisements on our Sites. This involves matching offline purchase information (for example, through a rewards card program) with browsing information on our Site. This helps us determine when you view a particular product advertisement on our Site and subsequently make an offline purchase in a store.
Please remember that if you post any information in areas of our Sites that are generally accessible to users, such as chat rooms and message boards, it will be available to the public.
Do Not Track Signals
Web browser Do Not Track (DNT) settings are not enabled on the Sites. Therefore, no action will be taken with respect to "do-not-track" configurations in your internet browser. By default, you will receive a personalized experience while browsing our website.
Ad Choices
The majority of advertisements on our Sites are served to you on our behalf by our third party ad serving contractor Doubleclick. However, we do allow third parties (such as advertisers, ad agencies, and ad networks) to serve some of the advertisements on our Sites. Please remember that BabyCenter does not have access to, or control over, the placement of cookies or other tracking mechanisms that these third parties may use or the information these third parties may collect. Such third parties may use cookies which have been placed on your computer to gather information about you and understand the types of pages visited by you and content that you view on our Sites and other websites. These third parties may associate your browser with relevant interest categories and use these categories to show you interest-based advertisements. For example, if you frequently visit travel websites, they may direct to you ads related to travel.
You do have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our web site. Many, but not all, third parties engaged in interest based advertising participate in an industry wide self regulatory program which has developed consumer-friendly standards for interest based advertising. You can opt out of interest-based advertising offered by participating third parties. With respect to third parties that do not participate in this program, they may or may not offer a mechanism for opting out of interest based advertising.
In addition to the foregoing, you can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse or delete cookies altogether, but certain features of the Sites might not work without certain cookies.
Security
We take reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. But, you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. In particular, email sent to or from the Sites may not be secure.
Occasionally, we provide links to other sites for your convenience and information. These sites operate independently from our Sites and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices or terms of use, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked sites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, or for any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any use of the linked sites.
California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by BabyCenter L.L.C. to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please submit a request to our customer service team . Please allow thirty (30) days after receipt of your request for a response to be provided.
