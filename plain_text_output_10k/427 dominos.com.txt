Domino’s offers various applications for smart devices; these applications allow you to (amongst other things) order pizzas, track your order, locate your nearest store and receive vouchers or current deal notifications.
You will be able to access your Domino’s Online Ordering account using these applications.
In addition to recording your smart device’s IP address as part of your online order, your smart device’s ID may also be recorded in order to effectively provide you with the application’s services.
A Domino’s application may seek to activate location tracking services on your smart device. This function may result in your location being used for purposes such as:
marketing (i.e. a nearby store sending you a special deal); or
identification of your closest Domino’s store.
You will have the ability to opt out of these location tracking services by:
declining this option when first prompted by the application; or
manually turning this function off within your smart device’s settings.
On Time Cooking order
As part of an On Time Cooking order, you will be provided with the option to:
activate location tracking services on your smart device; or
enter the address that you will be leaving from to collect your order.
If location tracking services are activated, cooking will only commence once you are on-route to the store.
We will stop tracking your location once your order has been collected or after 3 hours, whichever is earlier.
If you instead choose to enter your address, the store will estimate your travel time and commence cooking accordingly.
Using the location data provided, the store will endeavour to provide you with a hotter, fresher pizza, ready upon your arrival.
Any location data obtained will be deleted after seven days.
For further information about On Time Cooking orders, please refer to our Website Terms and Conditions.
