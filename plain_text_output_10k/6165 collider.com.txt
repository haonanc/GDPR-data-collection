What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of your personally identifiable information (“Personally Identifiable Information”), which is information that we can use to identify you as an individual.  Personally Identifiable Information includes information such as your name, username, password, age, email address, and other information that we associated with Personally Identifiable Information.  This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personally Identifiable Information that our business partners share with us or we share with our business partners.

Certain Site features require you to create an account and login in order to access them.  You may be able to use your login for a Third Party Service (such as Facebook or Google+) to access these features. By creating a user account with us or signing in using a Third Party Service login, you are providing your Personally Identifiable Information to us and to third parties such as the third party providing the Third Party Service.

Information We Collect About You:
Site Usage Information.  We automatically collect certain types of information about activities on our Sites, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites.  This information is aggregated and anonymized or de-identified, and does not identify individual users such as yourself.  We use Google Analytics to collect this type of information, so Google may also have access to this information.  You may read Google’s Privacy Policy (including any opt-out mechanisms that Google offers) here and here .
Third Party Services.  As mentioned above, we may allow you to link your accounts with Third Party Services such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter to our Sites (“Social Network Accounts”).  If you link your Social Network Accounts to our Sites, we may receive information from the Third Party Service about you.  Any information we receive from the Third Party Service will be governed by the terms and conditions of the Third Party Service and by the privacy controls you have set on your Social Network Account with that Third Party Service.  The Third Party Service may also have access to information you provide to us or activities that you carry out on our Sites while logged into your Social Network Account with that Third Party Service, and this access will be governed by the terms and conditions of the Third Party Service and by the privacy controls you have set on your Social Network Account with that Third Party Service.  We encourage you to review the policies of your Third Party Service before linking your Social Network Account.

How We Collect Information From You
We use several methods to collect information from you.  As mentioned above, we use Google Analytics to collect many types of Site usage information, and you can learn more about Google Analytics here .  In addition, we may use:​
Cookies.  A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your device when you use our Sites. When you use our Sites a second time, the cookie allows our Sites to recognize your device or browser.  Some Site features may not function properly without cookies.  We use cookies to understand how people use the Sites and to improve content and services we offer through the Sites.  We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track Site usage patterns, to personalize what content you see when you visit the Sites, and to record requests for subscriptions to our services.  Our cookies may collect Personally Identifiable Information or aggregated, anonymized or de-identified information.  Some features of the Site may not function properly without cookies.
Our authorized third party partners (including advertising and marketing companies) may ask us to set and access cookies on your browser, or may directly place their cookies on your browser.   We do not allow our third party partners to set and access cookies on our Sites without our permission. These cookies may be used to help deliver advertising and communications to consumers.

Device Identifiers.  When you access our Sites via a mobile device such as a smartphone, we may collect data using or linked to unique identifiers that are assigned to your mobile device, which are called device identifiers.  You can limit the use of device identifiers by accessing your device’s settings and limiting the use of device identifiers or resetting your device’s identifiers.
GIFs.  When you visit our Sites, we may collect data using clear GIFs (also known as web beacons or pixel tags) and similar technologies.  We may also use clear GIFs in our communications with you (such as emails) to track information such as whether you have received and opened our communication. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an email or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet, enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.  A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personally Identifiable Information.

California & Canadian Users: Your California Privacy Rights.
California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personally identifiable information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing.  This Privacy Policy explain our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct or indirect marketing purposes.
In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, if you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may contact us at email@collider.com.  Canadian residents also have certain rights to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities.   For the avoidance of doubt, these opt-out options are available for all users and are not limited to Californian and Canadian users.
