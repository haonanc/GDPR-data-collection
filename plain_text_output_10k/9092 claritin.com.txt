1. GENERAL
Your privacy is important to us. We want you to understand how we may             collect, use, share and keep information about you and the choices that are             available to you. This Online Privacy Policy describes the types of             information we may collect about you, the purposes for which we use the             information, the circumstances in which we may share the information, the             steps that we take to safeguard the information and to protect your             privacy; and other important privacy terms (as updated from time-to-time,             this “Online Privacy Policy”) that apply when you visit the Clarity Money             website (www.claritymoney.com and app.claritymoney.com), and any associated             or successor websites, products, services or mobile applications             (collectively, the “Site”).
By using the Site, you are accepting the terms of this Online Privacy             Policy and you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure and             protection of your information as described in this Online Privacy Policy.
As used throughout this Online Privacy Policy, the terms (1) “Clarity Money,”              “we,” “us” or “our” means Clarity Money, Inc. and its successors,             agents and assigns worldwide; (2) “you” or “your” means any user of the             Site; and (3) “includes” or “including” means “including but not limited             to” or “includes but is not limited to.”
As you review this Online Privacy Policy, please remember information you             provide to us in connection with the Site may be governed by a separate             notice called the Clarity Money Privacy Notice. Please refer to that notice for additional              information about our privacy practices and your rights.
This Online Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible             for, the personal information collection, use, disclosure or security, or             other practices, of any third parties to which the Site may link, which is             framed within the Site, or which is otherwise available on or through the             Site (including, for example, social media “like,” “share,” or similar             buttons, some of which may collect information from you even when you do             not interact with them). Such third parties may also include, for example,             lenders, credit card companies and other providers of products and             services. Information collected by these third parties is governed by their             privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.
The inclusion of a link, button, or similar functionality within the Site             or the Site’s framing of a third party’s website does not imply our             endorsement of the third party. In addition, we are not responsible for and             have no liability for the content, features, products, services, privacy             policies or terms of service of any other third party, social media             platform, operating system or wireless service provider; or device             manufacturer.
We may change this Online Privacy Policy from time-to-time. If we make             changes to this statement, we will update the “Last Modified” date at the             top of this page. Any changes to this Online Privacy Policy will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise. Your continued use of the             Site following the posting of any changes will mean that you accept those             changes.

Automatically Collected Information
In addition to the information that you provide to us, we collect certain             information automatically through your use of the Site or interaction with             our advertisements.

Clickstream Data helps us suggest products or service             offerings that may be of interest to you. This information may be used by             us (or third parties on our behalf) for the purposes described in this             Online Privacy Policy or for other business purposes as permitted by law.

In addition, we may share information that does not specifically and             personally identify you, such as aggregated information, device identifiers             or other unique identifiers to third parties.

6. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Like many online services, we use tracking technologies such as cookies,             web beacons and similar technologies. We may also use these technologies to             record your preferences, track your use of the Site across multiple             devices, measure exposure to our online advertisements, monitor traffic,             improve the Site and make the Site easier to use.
We may use and disclose the information described in this section for any             purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.             If we combine the information described in this section with information             that is deemed “personal information” under applicable law, we will treat             the combined information as described within this Online Privacy Policy,             for as long as it is combined.
You have choices to limit some tracking mechanisms that collect information             when you use the Site. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but             you can usually modify your browser’s setting to decline cookies if you             prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, certain features of the Site may             not function properly or may not remain accessible to you. In addition, you             may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting or removing their             associated cookies. Note that, if you choose to remove cookies, you may             remove opt-out cookies that affect your advertising preferences.
For more information about your choices, see Interest-Based Advertising             below.
Cookies
Cookies are small text files that may be placed on your device when you use             the Site or when you view advertisements that we have placed on other             websites. Cookies allow your browser to remember some specific information             which the web server can later retrieve and use. When you quit your             browser, some cookies are stored in your computer’s memory, while some             expire or disappear.
Tags, Pixels, Web Beacons, Clear GIFs
A web beacon, also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is             typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a webpage or in an             email. These may be used when you are served with advertisements, when you             interact with advertisements outside of our online services or when you             interact with our communications. They are generally used to transmit             information back to a web server.
Interest-Based Advertising
We may use third party advertising companies to serve advertisements             regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you use             other applications and online services, based on information relating to             your access to and use of the Site and other apps and online services. To             do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique identifier on your             device. If you would like more information about this practice, and to             learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular             device from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/ and http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ . To opt out in the mobile application, go to www.aboutads.info/appchoices to download the App Choices app.
If you choose to opt-out, a cookie will be placed on your browser or device             indicating your decision. This cookie is specific to a particular device             and browser, so if you use different browsers or devices, you will need to             opt-out on each. In addition, because the opt-out is facilitated via             cookies, if you clear your cookies you will need to opt-out again.
Additional Technology
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, on the             Site. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help             us analyze how users interact with and use the Site, compile reports on the             Site’s activity and provide other services related to Site activity and             usage. The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your             IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor and any             referring website. The Site does not use Google Analytics to gather             information that personally identifies you. The information generated by             Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be             subject to Google’s privacy policies. To learn more about Google’s partner             services and to learn how to opt out of tracking of analytics by Google,             click https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ .
7. INFORMATION SECURITY: HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
We employ protections to keep data secure, but no data transmission or             storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We seek to limit access             to your personal information to authorized employees, agents, contractors             or Third-Party Service Providers. We also maintain physical, electronic and             procedural safeguards to protect the information against loss, misuse,             damage or modification and unauthorized access or disclosure while in our             possession.
8. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
You must be an individual of at least eighteen (18) years of age and reside             in the United States or on a United States military base, or in a United             States Territory in order to use the Site. If you do use the Site outside             of the United States, you understand and consent to the transfer of your             personal information to, and the collection, processing and storage of your             personal information in, the United States and elsewhere. The laws in the             United States and these countries regarding personal information may be             different from the laws of your state or country.
9. OTHER PRIVACY POLICIES OR STATEMENTS
This Online Privacy Policy provides a general statement of the ways in             which we protect your personal information through the Site. We may,             however, provide you with privacy notices, disclosures, policies or terms             that supplement this Online Privacy Policy. For example, personal             information we have about you may be governed by a separate notice called             the Clarity Money Privacy Notice. Please refer to that notice for             additional information about our privacy practices and your rights. To the             extent that there is a conflict between this Online Privacy Policy and any             other privacy notice, disclosure, policies or terms provided by us, the             privacy notice, disclosure, policies or terms relating to that particular             use of the Site will govern.
10. DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Your browser or device may include Do Not Track functionality. The Site is             not built to respond to Do Not Track signals. That means that, even if your             browser is set to “Do Not Track,” our information collection and disclosure             practices (including the choices that we provide to customers) will             continue to operate as described in this Online Privacy Policy.
