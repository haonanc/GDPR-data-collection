Last Updated: July 26, 2018
Vungle, Inc. and its group companies ("Vungle", "we" or "us") respect your privacy. This privacy notice ("Notice")         explains who we are, how we collect, use and share personal information about you, and how you can exercise         your privacy rights.
This Notice covers personal information we collect:
when providing the Vungle Ad Services (see Section 2 ); and
when you visit one of our Websites, and in the usual course of our business, such as in connection with             our events, sales and marketing activities (see Section 3 ).
QUICK LINKS
We recommend that you read this Notice in full to ensure you are fully informed. However, to make it easier         for you to review those parts of this Notice which apply to you, we have divided up the document into         the following sections:
1. WHO WE ARE
Vungle is an ad network providing a technology platform (“Platform”) for Clients that want to advertise and/or         monetize their applications, games, and other products. Our "Clients" include "Advertisers" that wish         to distribute ad content through the Vungle Platform, and "Publishers" of applications that want to display         relevant ads to end users ("End Users") of third party applications ("apps") that use our SDKs, APIs,         hosted video advertising platform and/or any of our related advertising tools (collectively, the "Vungle         Ad Services").
Advertising revenue helps keep many games and apps free. We work hard to ensure that the ads that pay the         app developer bills are interesting, relevant, and safe for End Users.
2. PRIVACY FOR THE VUNGLE AD SERVICES
This Section describes how Vungle collects and uses information we receive from End Users ("you") of apps         that use the Vungle Ad Services.
2.1 What information do we collect?
When you visit an app that uses Vungle technology, we use and deploy “tracking technologies” (see Section 2.3 , below) to automatically collect certain information about your device. Some of this         information (including for example, your IP address and certain unique identifiers), may identify a particular         computer or device and may be "personal data" in some jurisdictions, including the EU. We collect this         information the first time Vungle’s SDK is initialized on a Publisher Client’s app. Note, however, that         Vungle’s Ad Services do not collect any information that that enables us to identify End Users personally         (such as your name, address, or email address).
The information we collect includes:
Information about your device, such as the type and model, manufacturer, operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, etc.),                 carrier name, time zone, network connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular), IP address, Vungle                 SDK version, information about the Publisher Client's app currently active on your device (but                 not any other apps), and identifiers assigned to your device, such as its iOS Identifier for                 Advertising (IDFA), Android Advertising ID (AAID or GAID), or other unique device identifier                 (a number uniquely allocated to your device by your device manufacturer or Publisher Client’s                 app).
Information about your behavior on our Publisher Client's app, such as information about the activities or actions on those apps, session start/stop                 time, geolocation (latitude and longitude co-ordinates, but only if the Publisher Client’s app                 has enabled location services on your device and you have granted the Publisher permission to                 collect this information).
Information about ads served, viewed, or clicked on, such as the type of ad, where the ad was served, whether you clicked on it, the number                 of times you have seen the ad, and whether you visited the Advertiser’s website or relevant app                 store and/or purchased or installed the product or service advertised.
We may also combine, merge, and/or enhance the information we collect about your device, including the personal         data, with information we may collect about your interactions with other Publisher Client’s Apps and         ads served through Vungle’s Platform, or with information collected from our Clients and third parties         (such as data providers). This may include, for example, mobile device IDs, demographic or interest data,         and content viewed or actions taken on an app to help make the ads served to you more relevant while         limiting your exposure to less relevant ads. We (or our third party partners) may also use this additional         information to undertake "user matching," which means that in addition to the ID an End User has been         assigned in our system, we may also receive a list of unique IDs our external partners or Clients have         assigned to an End User.
There may also be situations where Vungle’s SDK is not incorporated into the Publisher Client’s app, but         we still receive some of the same data listed above in order to respond to an Ad request from a Publisher         Client’s app.
2.2 How do we use your information?
We use the information we collect (sometimes in combination with information provided and sourced by independent         validation partners) for a variety of business purposes. For example, we use the personal information         we collect for the following purposes:
Serving Ads: To allow Publishers to offer advertising inventory in their apps, and Advertisers             to bid on and display ads in that inventory.
Ad Reporting and Conversions: Reporting to Advertisers information about when and how End             Users have been exposed to their ads, clicked on their ads, or visited their website.
Frequency Capping: Preventing End Users from seeing the same ad too many times.
Customizing Ads: To customize and more effectively tailor the ads we display to you and             to optimize the display of ads (including limiting your exposure to less relevant ads).
Performance Analytics: To analyze ad performance, such as tracking views of ads, as well             as click-through rates to websites or app stores and/or installs of apps that have been advertised.
Fraud Detection and Prevention: Identifying invalid clicks, installs, or ad queries, and             protecting us and our Clients from fraudulent behavior.
Providing and Improving the Vungle Ad Services: Auditing, researching, and analyzing data             in order to provide, protect, and improve the Vungle Ad Services and to ensure that our technologies             function properly.
2.3 How do we use tracking technologies to collect information?
We use standard tracking technologies to collect information automatically from your device so that our backend         operations can use it to perform many of the functions described in “ How do we use your information? ” above. To opt out of our use of such technologies, please follow         the instructions for opting out in the apps, as described in “ Opt-Out Choices ” below.
The standard tracking technologies we use include:
Mobile "SDKs" or "Software Development Kits" (including our own SDKs): These are blocks             of code that are embedded into an app that allow Vungle to collect certain information (as described             in “ 2.1 What information do we collect? ” above relating to your use of apps using our technology.             The embedded code from Vungle’s SDK allows the app to “speak” with Vungle’s Platform for purposes             of delivering ads.
"Tags and Pixels": These are blocks of code that we and our Clients use to track your interaction             with apps using our technology. We use these to synchronize information that we have collected with             information independently collected by our Clients and other third party advertising platforms and             advertisers that are interested in providing you with ads.
Mobile device identifiers: We also use standard device identifiers, for example the IDFA             advertising identifier used on Apple’s iOS devices and the GAID advertising identifier used on Android             devices, to monitor and improve the performance of the ads we show you.
Other technologies: Additionally, we use other technologies, including locally stored objects,             to collect information from your device in order to assist with the delivery of ads and to provide             reporting to our Clients.
2.4 Your Opt-Out Choices.
You can opt out of having your information being used by Vungle for performance-based advertising by accessing         your mobile device settings and following the most recent published instructions . If you limit ad tracking, you will still see advertisements         (even ones sourced from Vungle’s network), but Vungle will no longer be able to use the personal information         described above in Section 2.1 to serve you with more relevant ads. In addition, the advertising identifier (along with         any information collected about that identifier) that was previously assigned to you will also be disassociated. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt back in, we will not be able to use any of your         past information, and you will for all practical purposes be a new user to our system. You may also stop         the collection of location information by particular apps by changing the preferences on your mobile         device.
2.5 How Do We Share Information?
Please see Section 4.1, below for information concerning how Vungle shares the information collected.
2.6 Privacy Practices of Vungle Clients.
Vungle is not responsible for the information practices of our Clients. We require our Clients to comply         with all applicable laws and regulations and to provide End Users with notice of the collection of data         for advertising purposes as outlined in this Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy policies         of apps you visit for information about those apps’ data collection and use practices.
2.7 Children.
Our Clients are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply fully with applicable children's data         privacy protection legislation, such as the United States' Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"),         including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information.         With respect to COPPA specifically, we rely upon our Publisher Clients to confirm whether or not their         app is subject to COPPA. As required by COPPA, Vungle will enable a flag in our system such that the         End User’s device history is disassociated, and the only End User “personal information” used by the         Vungle Ad Services would be Publisher-specific unique digital identifiers (e.g., IP address and device         identifiers) to support Vungle’s internal operations.
3. PRIVACY FOR THE VUNGLE WEBSITES
This Section describes how we collect and use Information in the usual course of business, including through         our websites (such as https://vungle.com/ or any other website on which this Notice is posted) and other corporate services,         web portals, and dashboards we make available to our Clients and End Users (collectively "Websites"),         as well as in connection with our events, sales and marketing activities.

The personal information that you are asked to provide (and the reasons why you are asked                 to provide it) will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.                 We will also let you know prior to collection whether the provision of personal information we                 are collecting is compulsory or may be provided on a voluntary basis and the consequences, if                 any, of not providing the information.

Please note that we may impose a small fee for access and disclosure of your             personal information where permitted under applicable law, which will be communicated to you.
In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. To exercise these rights email privacy@vungle.com .

If you choose to no longer receive marketing information, we may still             communicate with you regarding such things as your security updates, product functionality, responses             to service requests, or other transactional, non-marketing/administrative related purposes.
If we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness             of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal             information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal             information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details             for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area (" EEA")are available here .
Please note that because most of the information we store can only identify a particular browser or device,         and cannot identify you individually, you will need to provide us with some additional information to         enable us to identify the personal information we hold about you and ensure that we accurately fulfil         your request.
4.3 Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA residents only).
If you are an individual from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using personal information described         above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect         it. However, we normally rely on our legitimate interest to collect personal information from you, except         where such interests are overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.         Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal information, they include the interests         described in the sections headed “ 2.2 How do we use your information? ”, “ 3.2 How do we use your information? ” above.
In some cases, we may rely on our consent or have a legal obligation to collect personal information from         you, or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another         person. If we rely on consent to collect and/or process your personal information, we will obtain such         consent in compliance with applicable laws.
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and         use your personal information, please contact us using the details provided under the heading “ Contact Us ” below.
4.4 Third-Party Websites and Apps:
This Notice only applies to the Vungle Websites and Vungle Ad Services. We are not responsible for the privacy         practices or disclosures of websites, developers, or apps that use or access the Vungle Services or Vungle         Ad Services. In addition, ads within the Vungle Platform may contain links to third-party websites and         apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or apps is not governed by this Notice, but instead         is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information         practices of such third parties.
4.5 How do we keep your personal information secure?
We use appropriate administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the personal         information we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of         security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information and to help ensure that your         data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. Specific         measures we will use include hashing and pseudonymization of data prior to storage. However, no electronic         transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,         so you should take care in deciding what information you send us in this way.
4.6 Data Retention
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do         so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements, to enforce our agreements         or comply with our legal obligations). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your         personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such data or, if this is not possible (for example,         because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your         personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
1. If you are an End User, we typically store the personal information we collect about you, such as your         IP address and other information described above, for 13 months from the date of collection before we         delete, overwrite, or anonymize that data, unless we are required to keep it to comply with a legal or         audit obligation.
Please contact us at privacy@vungle.com if you have any questions about the information we collect and/or how we use the         information we collect.

These countries may have         data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.
However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected         in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual         Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies         to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection         law. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate         safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon         request.
