We prohibit any advertising of our brand and Web site using unsolicited email messages. Not complying with this policy will cause partnership termination and/or affiliate account termination.

Cookies
Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive by an Internet server when you visit a web site. Some cookies can be used to identify your computer each time you visit a site. Although most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, a user may decline the placement of a cookie on his or her hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of one’s Web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Users should understand, however, that certain areas within Money Map Press website properties may not function properly if the Web browser will not accept cookies.
The Total Wealth web site or other Money Map Press web sites uses cookies to allow authentication for access to the Subscriber Only areas of our sites. In other words, you can leave the site and come back without having to re-enter your email or user name and password every time.
Total Wealth or other Money Map Press web sites may use cookies to recognize user access privileges, track site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services of interest and estimate the readership size.
Submitting Data
Visitors to the Total Wealth web site or other Money Map Press sites are asked to submit a log-on name and password to visit Subscriber Only sections of the sites. This is to ensure you can receive the services you are paying for. Users may also be asked to provide an email to access certain member-only areas of our websites. Any e-mail you send to Total Wealth is completely confidential.
Ordering Online
Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer – an encryption protocol – and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.
In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.
Total Wealth does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of Total Wealth ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Total Wealth products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it.

Any e-mail you send to Total Wealth is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity.
