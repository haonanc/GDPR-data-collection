Within the New York Life Family of Companies to let you know about our products and services. The information we share may include household and financial data.
With non-affiliated companies with which we have joint agreements, such as banks, credit card issuers and online services, to offer you their products and services. The information we share may include name, address and information about your transactions with us.
With your agent and his or her new company if your agent leaves the New York Life Family of Companies. We may share your name, address and information about your New York Life products so that your agent can continue to service your needs.
