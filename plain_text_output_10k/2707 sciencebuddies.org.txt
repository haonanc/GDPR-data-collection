Our Commitment to Privacy
As a not-for-profit institution, our goal is to collect only the information about our users and their use of our services that will help us provide the best online experience possible and implement Science Buddies' mission to build science literacy.
Science Buddies is committed to providing a safe and secure website for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding all personal information collected online and to helping our visitors learn how to exercise control over personal information while exploring the Internet.
To help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this summary of our information practices. This privacy notice governs the collection and use of information at ScienceBuddies.org.
As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices from time to time. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected.
The Information We Collect
At ScienceBuddies.org we do not collect personally identifiable information, unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us.  For some tools on our website, such as the Topic Selection Wizard, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include zip code, gender, grade level, or ethnicity.  For other tools—such as the Help button, "Email This" feature, and some of our online surveys—we ask visitors to provide us with an email address so that we may provide the requested support.     For ongoing activities, such as the Ask an Expert Forums (bulletin boards), we ask visitors to provide us with a username and password, zip code, and email address to create an online account. If you would like Science Buddies to stop collecting and using your child's information, please email scibuddy@sciencebuddies.org .
For select programs, such as our online mentoring, or becoming a Science Buddies Member, we ask for more detailed information, which we use to develop program requirements and to ensure the safety of all participants.   To apply as a student volunteer for Science Buddies, or as a participant in one of our student mentoring programs, visitors need to provide us with personal information so that we are better able to place participants in a suitable role or mentoring environment. The types of information collected at these pages include:  name, address, email address, phone number, academic, background, interests, etc. In addition, student volunteers are asked to provide contact information for a parent, including an email address, parent's name, address, and home phone number.
For purchases made on our site, we will collect information such as address and phone number that is necessary to complete delivery of your order.  We do not store any credit card information you supply to complete a purchase.
We may collect information about you from third-party sources.  For example, we may receive information about you from third-party social media services when you choose to interact or connect with them through our website.
If you access third-party services, such as Facebook or Google through our website to login to Science Buddies or to share information about your experience on Science Buddies with others, these third-party services may be able to collect information about you, including information about your activity on our website, and they may notify your connections on the third-party services about your use of our website, in accordance with their own privacy policies.
For Science Buddies users of Google Classroom, we will collect user information from Google that allows us to deliver Google Classroom functionality through our website.  Such information may include email address, name, course information, class information, assignments, and submissions.  You may revoke Science Buddies' access to your account on Google at any time by updating the appropriate settings in your Google account preferences. You should check your privacy settings on Google to understand and change the information sent to us. Please review Google's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our website.
This Web site has the following types of security measures: limited access data-centers, firewall technology, and secure-socket-layer (SSL) certificate authentication. SSL is an encryption technology that provides security for information that's transmitted over the Internet. This site accepts orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through SSL technology-for example, Internet Explorer (version 7.0 or higher), Firefox (version 3.0 or higher), Safari (version 4 or higher), and Chrome (version 2 or higher).
While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.
Cookies
Like many organizations, we use cookies and log files on our website. Cookies are small text files that websites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors to their sites. A cookie contains a unique code, which is used to recognize your computer when a user of your computer returns to a website that was visited previously. Log files are text files that websites like ours automatically create on our own computer servers when a user visits the site. We use cookies and log files to enhance the online experience of our visitors and to better understand how our site is used. Cookies and log files may tell us, for example, whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a new visitor.
The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember,  though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features, such as our Topic Selection Wizard.
We may allow third parties to place and read their own cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information on our website. These third parties may collect information about a user's online activities over time and across sites, services, and devices to, for example, help us with traffic measurement, research, analytics, and serve you more relevant advertising on third party sites and services.   This information is collected directly and automatically by these third parties, and Science Buddies does not participate in these data transmissions.  These third parties may participate in programs that allow you to opt out of targeted advertising. To learn more and opt out, visit the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .
The Way We Use Information
We may use information in the following ways:
For the purposes for which visitors specifically provided the information, including, for example, to respond to an inquiry, offer online forums (bulletin boards), or to enable us to process, validate,  and verify online registration or match volunteers in the mentoring programs.
To send you email updates about our new or existing products and services, or to otherwise contact you.
To enhance existing features or develop new features, products, and services.
To communicate with our funders and colleagues about the demographics of who is using our website.
In the case of our online mentoring programs, we use the information provided to ensure that the applicant is matched with a suitable team. We do not share this information with outside parties.  Personal information is used strictly for program administration. On some occasions, we may provide general background information, but not personally identifiable information, about a student and/or a student's school to enable our volunteer Mentors and Advisors to provide appropriate guidance to student participants. For example, we might share with a Mentor that the student with whom he is working is a 7th-grade student at a public school in an underserved urban area in a large east coast city.
We use the information provided about someone else as a secondary contact in the event that you cannot be reached. We do not share this information with outside parties.
We use return addresses to answer the email we receive and/or to inquire about the user's desire for additional services. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with  outside parties.
We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our program and to share with parties interested in offering financial support to our program. One of the most important uses of such information is to analyze how much traffic our different webpages and services receive.  Or, another example, we may tell a potential funder that X number of women volunteered as advisors, or  that Y number of men and Z number of women completed science fair projects, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process; for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our website and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. In addition, we will provide a student's information to school officials when there is any known case of cheating, plagiarism, or fraud, stemming from information provided on our website.  We may also transfer personally identifiable information about you if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company.
We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing visitors an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. If you would like Science Buddies to stop collecting and using your child's information, please email scibuddy@sciencebuddies.org .
