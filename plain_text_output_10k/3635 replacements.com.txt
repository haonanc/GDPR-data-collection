Gift Registries
We contract with a third party provider for online registry services for our customers who are U.S. residents; these registrants register on the provider's website and not on replacements.com. Separately, you may set up a gift registry with us via telephone or in our retail store; in those instances, the following information is requested: name, address, phone number, email address (optional), any wedding date, "ship to" address, and requested item(s) for selected pattern(s).

We do not sell or rent any information regarding our customers to any third party. We never disclose any information to third parties for a third party's direct marketing purposes.
We may share the information we collect from and about you with companies or individuals that provide services or perform functions that enable us to serve you. To help us better serve you, we may combine information we get from you with information about you we get from third parties. These functions or services provided by other companies may include order fulfillment, package delivery, communications, postal or email delivery, customer service, data analysis, credit or payment processing, and the like. These companies or individuals may need information about you to perform their work. These companies or individuals are carefully selected and must agree to safeguard your information in strict compliance with this policy when we deem appropriate.
If some or all of our business assets are sold or transferred, we may transfer the corresponding information regarding our customers. We also may retain a copy of that information.
We also collect consumer information from third party providers to update or enhance our customer database or increase our understanding of our customers. For example, we may get updated addresses so that our customer address information remains current and accurate. We may also obtain information about other people from you. For example, if you order a gift to be delivered directly to a friend, you would need to give us the friend's name and address.

For individuals in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA), here are details about how we use your personal data that we process as a data "controller" under the GDPR.
Use of Personal Data
Our use of your personal data is justified on the following legal bases:
the use of your personal data is necessary to perform a contract with you or take steps to enter into a contract at your request (i.e., because you have purchased something from us, sold to us, or requested information about your interests and/or our products and services);

the use of your personal data is in our legitimate interests, subject to your interests and fundamental rights, and notably our legitimate interest in using applicable data to conduct and develop our business activities; or

fulfill the purposes set forth in "Communications With You" above.
Other Disclosures
In accordance with our legal obligations, we may also transfer your personal data, subject to a lawful request, to public authorities for law enforcement or national security purposes, and also as set forth in "Disclosure to and from Third Party Companies" above.
Additional disclosures or information about processing of personal information related to specific websites, mobile applications, products, services, or programs may be provided to you. These may supplement and/or clarify our privacy practices in specific circumstances and provide you with additional choices as to how we may process your personal information.
Cookies
You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already-set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers.

Retention of Your Personal Data
We keep personal data for as long as required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax, and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required. In specific circumstances, we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time corresponding to a statute of limitation, so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.

to restrict processing of your personal data under certain circumstances;
to port your data in machine-readable format to a third party (or to you) when we justify our processing on the basis of your consent or the performance of a contract with you;
to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal data (where that processing is based on your consent); and
to obtain, or see a copy of the appropriate safeguards under which your personal data is transferred to a third country or international organization.
In addition to the above rights, you may, subject to applicable law, have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to any processing of your personal data for which we have justified on the basis of a legitimate interest, including profiling (as opposed to your consent) or to perform a contract with you.
