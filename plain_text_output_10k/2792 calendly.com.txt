Effective May 18, 2018
Calendly LLC (“Calendly”, “we”, or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy. We want you to feel confident using our services, and this privacy policy (“Policy”) is to help you understand and describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain about users of our websites, services, plug-ins, software or other Downloadable Tools (all of which we refer to as the “Platform”). This Policy describes the following:
What information we collect and how it is collected;
How we use the information;
With whom we may share information;
Legal basis for processing the information;
Your rights and choices;
Third party websites;
California Disclosures; and
Changes to the Policy and Contact Information.
Throughout this document, we will use a few terms to describe various roles. Calendly Members have signed up to use our service and created an account. Calendly Users are people who are scheduling with a Calendly Member and have not registered and created an account with us.
Information We Collect
We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Platform. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.
In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date and time.
Calendly is not directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete such personal information from our systems.
Information You Provide Voluntarily
Appointment Information. When a Calendly User comes to Calendly to schedule an event with a Calendly Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Calendly Member you are scheduling with. If you receive an invitation from a Calendly Member but do not wish to become a Calendly User, please contact the Calendly Member who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.
A Calendly Member may also connect their calendar with Calendly. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don't book you when you're busy. We never store who you're meeting with, their email, the meeting title or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.
Account Information. Calendly Members may give us permission to access their information in other services. For example, with your consent, you may link your Calendly account with your Google, Microsoft Office 365 account, or other similar service, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (like your basic profile or contacts). The information we get from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.
Billing Information. If you purchase a premium version of Calendly, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type and the expiration date.
Information Collected Automatically
Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below). Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Services, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:

This log data may include your web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms

Depending on how you’re accessing our products and subject to your opt-out preferences, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Calendly account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to keep you logged in to Calendly. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Calendly account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from Calendly if your computer supports such capabilities.
