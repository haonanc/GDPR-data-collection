3. INFORMATION MITÚ MAY COLLECT.
Mitú may collect both personally identifiable information as well as non-personally identifiable information when you visit or use the Services.
a. Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) means information that would allow a third party to identify or locate a particular person. PII includes, without limitation, your full name, email address, mailing address, mobile or other telephone number, birth date, and credit card number. Mitú only collects PII if that information is voluntarily provided by you. This may happen in several ways:
i. User Accounts. In order to access and utilize certain products or services provided by the Services, you may be required to create a user account and to provide certain PII, such as your full name, an email address, a user name and/or a password, contact information, etc. You are under no obligation to provide this information to mitú. However, if you decide not to share this information, you may be unable to create an account on the Services and/or you may be unable to fully utilize all or some the Services.
ii. Financial Transactions. Mitú may use third parties to provide credit card and other payment processing services for the Services. When you make any payment on or through the Services, you will be required to provide mitú and/or its authorized third party agents with financial information and related payment information. mitú and its third party agents may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on or through the Services. You authorize mitú and such third party payment processing services to store your payment history and payment account information (e.g. credit card account information) even after your account and/or your credit card has expired, to avoid interruptions in your service (e.g. subscriptions) and to facilitate easy payment for new service.
iii. Public Forums. Mitú may provide areas on the Services where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs and videos. Whenever you disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and may also appear on other websites and in publicly available search results. If you post your personal contact information, you may receive unsolicited messages. Mitú encourages you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to the public posting of your personal information.
b. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”) means information that does not allow a third party to identify or locate a particular person. You can visit the Services to read information about the Services and the products and services offered without revealing any PII. However, during your visit to the Services, mitú may collect anonymous Non-PII such as the activity of your browser when you are viewing the Services; your site path during your visit to the Services; demographic data; the amount of time you spend on the Services and general information regarding your internet service provider and host. The Non-PII may be collected by mitú in several ways:
i. Logging Of Your Activities On The Services. When you access the Services from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, mitú may collect and log information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). mitú may also collect and log anonymous “traffic data” information that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful to mitú for marketing purposes or for improving the services that mitú offers to its users, such as the pages you visit, the length of your visit, your referring/exit pages, your clickstream activity and the actions you take while using or visiting the Services. No personal information about you is revealed in this process.

iv. Third Parties. Mitú may institute information sharing programs with third parties. For instance, mitú may request that advertisers provide mitú with information regarding the ad response rate for the users of the Services that were served specific ads. This helps mitú improve the relevance of the advertisements that you are served. Mitú may also receive information about your interaction with various ads on other sites on an anonymous basis in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads and determine their relevance to you.
v. Mobile & Location Information. If you use mobile-enabled services provided by mitú, such as any mitú mobile application made available by mitú, mitú may receive information about your use of the Services from your mobile device while you use mitú’s applications or Services. This may also include information about your precise location if you have enabled location-based services on your mobile device. Certain applications or services may also require additional information collection, such as information to be collected and sent to mitú and/or third parties from your mobile device when you are not logged into mitú for alerts services, and the terms of any such collection will be fully disclosed to you when you subscribe to or sign up for such services or applications and you will be given the opportunity to opt-in to or to decline receiving such services or applications.
c. Do Not Track Signals. At this time mitú does not respond to browser ‘Do Not Track’ signals, as mitú awaits the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.
