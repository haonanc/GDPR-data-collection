Information We Collect From Third Parties.  We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information we collect, such as information to validate or update your address or demographic and lifestyle information.
2. Information Collected Through Tracking Technologies
Tracking Technologies.  In addition to any information that you choose to submit to us, we and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”), that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your Device whenever you visit or interact with the Services or third party sites.  This information may include your Device identifier, the type and version of Internet browser software you use, and your operating system.  We may also collect password information from you when you log in, as well as computer and connection information.  During some visits, we may use these tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information.  Certain features of our Services are only available through the use of Tracking Technologies.  You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third party service providers that we have allowed on our Services and who assist us with various aspects of our operations and Services.  We use Google to serve first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to the Services.  To learn about Google Analytics’ current available opt-outs for the web, click here.  To learn more about how Google uses cookies in interest based advertising, you can visit the Google ad and content network privacy policy located at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ .  You can opt-out of receiving interest based Google ads, or customize the ads Google shows you by clicking https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en .  Please be aware that if you choose to block certain cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use those cookie dependent features, and preferences that are dependent on cookies may be lost. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.  Tracking Technologies are used for a variety of purposes, including the following:

Functionality Related.  We may use Tracking Technologies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest.
Targeting Related.  We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, as well as to track the content you access. For more information, see Section 3 below.
Location Functionality.  Information gathered from your use of the Services may be combined with information from third-party sources to identify your location by state and region (“Regional Location”).  If you enable location services for our Services, we may collect Regional Location data periodically as you use or leave open our Services.
3. Targeted Advertising
Interest Based Advertising.  We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. To serve our ads, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others.  These third parties may use Tracking Technologies to send directly to your Device the advertisements and links that appear on the Services. They automatically receive your Device identifier when this happens.  Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements to you on third party websites and applications. Some of the advertising service providers may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies. If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads in this manner, you will continue to receive advertising messages, but they will not be customized to you based on your use of the Services and third party sites.  If you would like more information about advertisers’ use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept them, you can go to .  To learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising, or to know your choices about not having information used in this manner, you can go to  .  Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications. You can check the settings on your mobile Device for such options in your mobile Devices’ operating system. Alternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance “App Choices” mobile application and follow the instructions provided.
Please note that the opt-out is cookie-based and will only affect the specific computer or mobile application, and browser or operating system, on which the opt-out is applied. You can also accept or decline cookies through your browser settings. To learn more, please look at the cookie settings available in your specific web browser(s).
Browser “Do Not Track” Signals.  Some third party browsers provide “do not track” machine readable signals for websites, which are automatically applied by default and therefore do not necessarily reflect our visitors’ choice as to whether they wish to receive advertisements tailored to their interests.  As a result, we do not respond to these signals.
