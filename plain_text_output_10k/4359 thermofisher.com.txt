In this Privacy Statement (“Statement”), we, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Thermo Fisher”, “thermofisher.com”, “we”, or “us”), provide information about how we receive, collect, use and transfer information about you, a website visitor or user of our mobile application thermofisher.com, and the company or other legal entity that you represent (collectively, “you” or “your”), through thermofisher.com, and other websites that we operate and that include a direct link to this Statement, or through the mobile application thermofisher.com (collectively, the “Sites”). Thermo Fisher operates through its direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates, including those located outside of the European Economic Area and Switzerland. 
Carefully review this Statement, as your use of the Sites is subject to this Statement.
Scope. This Statement covers only information collected through the Sites. This Statement does not cover any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, collection conducted offline, through other of our products or services that do not display a direct link to this Statement, or by other companies at any third party sites we may link to.
Information You Actively Submit. If you create an account, order products, register for services, or otherwise send us data via the Sites, we collect information about you and the company or other entity you represent (e.g., your name, organization, address, email address, phone number, fax number). You may also provide information specific to your interaction with the Sites, such as payment information to make a purchase, shipping information to receive a purchase, or a resume to apply for employment. In such instances, you will know what data is collected, because you will actively submit it.
Information Passively Submitted. We collect information during your use and navigation of the Sites, such as the URL of the site you came from, the browser software you use, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, IP ports, date/time of access, data transferred, pages visited, amount of time you spend on the Sites, information about transactions conducted on the Sites, and other “clickstream” data. If you use our mobile app, then we also collect your device information (such as device OS version and device hardware), unique device identifiers (including device IP address), mobile phone number and geolocation data. This data is generated and collected automatically, as part of the standard operation of the Sites. We also use “cookies” to enhance and customize your experience of the Sites. A cookie is a small text file that may be stored on your computer or device used to access the Sites. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but doing so may prevent us from offering conveniences or features on the Sites. (To reject cookies, refer to information about your specific browser software.)
Use of Information. We use information that you actively submit via the Sites to fulfill product orders, provide requested services and information, and otherwise to respond appropriately to requests and to complete transactions. We use information passively submitted to personalize features and your experience of the Sites, and otherwise to generally improve the content, design, and navigation of the Sites. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may combine the various types of data we collect. We may conduct marketing analysis and similar research to assist us in making business decisions. Such analysis and research activities may be conducted through third party services, using anonymous data and aggregate statistics generated by our collection of information.
If you order products through our Sites, we may contact you by email to provide information about your order (e.g., order confirmations, shipment notifications). If you have an account with the Sites, we may also send you email regarding your account status or changes to relevant agreements or policies.
Marketing Information. From time to time and in compliance with applicable law requirements (e.g. based upon your prior consent if required under the law applicable to you), we may use contact information that you have provided to send you information regarding products and services, as well as other information that we think may be useful to you. If you do not wish to receive marketing information from us, you may opt out by declining marketing information when registering or at other information collection points on the Sites or by following opt out instructions included in such communications.

Service providers acting on our behalf shall be obliged to comply with this Statement and adhere to confidentiality requirements and will only receive access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or other reorganization or sale of our business or assets, we may share or transfer your information, where the recipient will be required to use the information in accordance with this Statement.
