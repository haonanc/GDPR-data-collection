OVERVIEW
The State of Alaska and its agents, contractors, sub-contractors, and third party service providers (collectively, "the Client") is              strongly committed to protecting the privacy of registrants and users of its products and services. Throughout cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a              safe and secure environment for you, our users.
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you, as a visitor, to the Site or user of any Site content, what kinds of information we may gather about you when              you visit the Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct,              the information. This privacy policy applies to the Site and any Site content that incorporates this policy. Please note that this policy applies only to the             Site and Site content, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link.
INFORMATION ABOUT ALL SITE VISITORS
In general, our site automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to the site. This is very much like television              ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much you              use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, the              https://akrespond.alaska.gov site offered by the Client uses a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how              many people. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our Site partners about how you              (responders and other entities that access the data) collectively, use the site.
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
DISCLOSURE
We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to the Site or information that you may give us on the Site, such as your name, email address,              gender, date of birth, social security number, Drivers License information, proof of Education, proof of healthcare professional licensure, DEA license              verification, Medical Board Certification, National Practitioner Database Status, Office of Inspector General LEIE Status, Active Clinical practice status,              Active clinical privileges, and any other credentialing information (the Registration Information) as may be deemed necessary by us, to any outside entities. The              Client, through the Site, may share such information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena, or in special cases such as a physical threat              to you or others. And, as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of the Site.

If we decide to change our privacy policy for the Site, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use              that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
