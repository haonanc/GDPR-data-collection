OUR USE OF COOKIES AND TRACKING TOOLS
Our Websites use cookies and other tracking tools.
A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive when you visit a site. The cookie stores information about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site. Cookies enable us to track how often Users are visiting our Websites and the specific pages visited, the number of entries in specific events, the estimated audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and other User preferences. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of the Websites. However, you may find that some areas on the Websites will be slower, or may not function at all, and you may not be able to participate in certain activities such as contests or sweepstakes if the cookies are disabled. To learn more about cookies generally, visit  http://www.allaboutcookies.org .
The Websites also use clear GIFs [Graphics Interchange Formats] (also known as pixel tags, web beacons or web bugs). A clear GIF is computer code that contains a unique identifier that enables us to monitor user activity and traffic of the Websites. We use GIFs to gather aggregate information on visits to our Websites, track usage of Website links and assist with registration and other features.
USE AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY ADVERTISERS AND SPONSORS; THIRD PARTY COOKIES AND TRACKING TOOLS
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on the Websites. These advertising companies may collect and use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to the Websites and other websites not owned and operated by us, and may also combine this information with other data about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may interest you (as inferred from your online activity).
We also share usage information about Users of the Websites with these companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on the Websites and other websites. For these purposes, we and our third party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit on the Websites through the use of GIFs. In the course of serving advertisements to the Websites, our third party advertisers may place or recognize a unique ‘cookie’ on your computer. The Websites may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of affiliate entities or of advertisers or sponsors who are companies that are not owned or operated by us, or our affiliates or subsidiaries. These entities may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies and/or clear GIFs to our Users. The data collected is used in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to Users of the Websites and other interactive media and may be used to keep track of user response to each advertisement. We also work with third-party data analytics and online targeting companies. Some of these companies may use non-personal information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide data and targeting recommendations based on which we may provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
Many of the third-party companies we work with are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative on online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices. The NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI members’ ad networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, go to  http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ .
Following are the names and websites of some of the other companies who may set cookies on the Websites to serve or present the ads that appear on the Websites and to conduct research about the advertisements. You may learn about opting out of their targeted advertising programs by going to their respective websites.

HOW WE PROTECT AND RETAIN INFORMATION
We use physical, technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information against unauthorized access, theft and loss. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that information to service your account or perform their job functions.
Although we takes precautions intended to help protect information that we process, no system or electronic data transmission is completely secure. Any transmission of your personal data is at your own risk and we expect that you will use appropriate security measures to protect your personal information.
You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and the information in your account. We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. You understand and agree that we may deliver electronic notifications about breaches of security to the email address on record on your account.
If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately at privacyofficer[at]mansueto.com.
We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Websites);
Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them)
Whether retention is advisable; and considering our legal position (such as, for statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
CROSS BORDER DATA TRANSFERS
Sharing of information sometimes involves cross-border data transfers to or from the United States of America and other jurisdictions. For example, where the Services are available to Users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), personal information is transferred to the United States. We use the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield and standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to validate transfers of EEA residents’ personal information from the EEA to other countries. For more information about our Privacy Shield certification, please read the PRIVACY SHIELD section below. Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal information of EEA residents to protect the privacy and security of the transferred personal information.
YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION
If you would like to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict or delete personal information (including Personal Data as defined in the PRIVACY SHIELD section below) that you have previously provided to us, or if you would like to receive an electronic copy of your personal information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (if this right to data portability is provided to you by law), you can contact us at privacyofficer[at]mansueto.com or by mail to Mansueto Ventures LLC, 7 World Trade Center, New York NY 10007 USA
In your request, please make clear what personal information you would like to have changed, whether you would like to have your personal information suppressed from our database, or other limitations you would like to put on our use of your personal information. For your protection, we only fulfill requests for the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.
Please note that we often need to retain certain data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Our databases and other records may have residual data which will not be removed. In addition, we also may not allow you to review certain data for legal, security or other reasons. If at any time you believe that the Services have not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please let us know. We will use good faith efforts to determine and correct the problem.
If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a  data protection authority  about how we process your personal information. Please also see the PRIVACY SHIELD section below.
CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
Mansueto Ventures respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen (13). Although Users of all ages may navigate through the Services, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under age thirteen (13). If we learn that a child under age thirteen (13) has improperly provided us with information, we will notify the child’s parent or legal guardian and thereafter delete the child’s personal information from our records.

Privacy Shield Principles

Notice
Prior to collecting Personal Data, Mansueto Ventures notifies EU Users about the categories of Personal Data that Mansueto Ventures collects and the purposes for collection and use of their Personal Data. Mansueto Ventures will only process Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which Mansueto Ventures collected it or for purposes later authorized.
We use the Personal Data that we collect from EU Users of the Services as described in this Privacy Policy. Before Mansueto Ventures uses Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different from the purpose for which Mansueto Ventures collected it or that was later authorized, Mansueto Ventures will provide EU Users with the opportunity to opt out.
Choice
If Mansueto Ventures collects Sensitive Personal Data, we will obtain explicit opt-in consent whenever Privacy Shield requires. Mansueto Ventures will obtain opt-in consent before Personal Data is disclosed to third parties other than those described in this Privacy Policy, before Personal Data is used for a different purpose than that purpose for which it was collected or later authorized, and whenever Privacy Shield requires.
Please see the YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION section above for more information about how to exercise your choices.
Accountability for Onward Transfer
Mansueto Ventures shares Personal Data collected through the Services as described above.
If Mansueto Ventures transfers Personal Data to a third party, Mansueto Ventures takes reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that each third party transferee processes Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with Mansueto Venture’s obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles. Mansueto Ventures will ensure that each transfer is consistent with any notice provided to EU Users and any consent they have given. Mansueto Ventures requires a written contract with any third party receiving Personal Data that ensures that the third party (i) processes the Personal Data for limited and specified purposes consistent with any consent provided by EU Users, (ii) provides at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, (iii) notifies Mansueto Ventures if it cannot comply with Privacy Shield; and (iv) ceases processing Personal Data or takes other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate.
As noted above, under certain circumstances, Mansueto Ventures may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including for national security or law enforcement requirements.
Mansueto Ventures remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if an agent processes Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Principles unless Mansueto Ventures is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
Security
Mansueto Ventures takes appropriate measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, unavailability and destruction. In determining these measures, Mansueto Ventures takes into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data.
Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation
Mansueto Ventures takes reasonable steps to ensure that such Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current. Mansueto Ventures adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles for as long as it retains Personal Data in identifiable form. Mansueto Ventures takes reasonable and appropriate measures to comply with the requirement under the Privacy Shield to retain Personal Data in identifiable form only for as long as it serves a purpose of processing.
Mansueto Ventures limits the collection of Personal Data to information that is relevant for processing. Mansueto Ventures does not process Personal Data in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by an EU User.
Access
A EU User has the right to access his or her Personal Data and to correct, amend, limit use of or delete the Personal Data if the Personal Data is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. Mansueto Ventures is not required to grant the rights to access, correct, amend and delete Personal Data if the burden or expense of providing access, correction, amendment or deletion is disproportionate to the risks to the EU User’s privacy or if the rights of persons other than the EU User are or could be violated.
