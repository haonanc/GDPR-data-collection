Automatic information, such as computer

e-mails
and other transactional information) and information concerning or related to our service. These communications are part of your relationship with Ecwid and you receive them as part of the Ecwid membership. If you or your store’s customers do not want to receive our emailed newsletters, other promotional announcements or 
non-transactional
communications, simply use your account name and password to access the control panel on Ecwid.com and disable any email notifications sent to you or your customers.

general information regarding the Services that you have registered to receive; and

You may not opt out of receiving such administrative communications.

third-party
advertising networks who collect IP addresses and other identifiers on our websites and emails and on 
third-party
websites. Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide advertisements about
third-party
products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements on other websites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Ecwid, however, does not grant third parties access to any personal information.
Information We Share
We share your personal information with your consent or as necessary to provide the Services. In addition, we share personal information with vendors or agents to provide the Services. For example, companies we’ve hired to provide customer service support may need access to personal information in order to provide those functions. In such cases, these companies must abide by our Privacy Policy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal information they receive from us for any other purpose. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to 
EU-US
or 
US-Swiss
Privacy Shield, Ecwid is potentially liable. We may also disclose personal data as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets. We will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve personal information, when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: (i) comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; (ii) protect our customers; (iii) operate and maintain the security of our Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks; or (iv) protect the rights and interest of Ecwid.  Finally, Ecwid also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
Do Not Track
Opting out
Ecwid does not use personal information for marketing its services, either through email or direct mailing. Ecwid may send some
non-marketing
opt-out,
such as information that you request we send to you or to third parties with whom you do business, and disclosures to comply with legal requirements and other informational notices.
Our newsletter is used as a general means of communication and may include updates to the Services as well as new partner agreements. You have the option to unsubscribe to our newsletter at anytime. If we intend to use your information for a purpose that is not compatible with these purposes or if we intend to disclose it to a type of third party not previously identified, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to opt out of such uses and/or disclosures.
Ecwid will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their information is to be disclosed to a third party or to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual should the occasion arise.
Our Use of Cookies and Other Identifiers
We use identifiers such as cookies, Web beacons and IP addresses to make interactions with users easy and meaningful.
Cookies
When you visit Ecwid.com, Ecwid’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Ecwid, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, you remain anonymous to Ecwid.
We use cookies that are
session-based
and 
persistent-based.
Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
If you have identified yourself to Ecwid.com, we use session cookies containing encrypted information to identify you uniquely. Each time you log into the Services, your browser saves a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier tied to your account. These session cookies allow Ecwid.com to identify you uniquely while you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Use of the Services requires session cookies.
Ecwid.com uses persistent cookies that only we can read and use to identify users who have visited our website previously. When you purchase the Services or provide us with personal information, our website assigns a unique identifier to you. This unique identifier derives from a persistent cookie that Ecwid.com places on your Web browser. We especially are careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we store neither account numbers nor passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate Ecwid.com, but you will be unable to use the Services successfully.
We may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with data about Ecwid’s website users to provide you with information about us and the Services.
The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable cookies. You also can disable or delete similar data used by browser
add-ons,
add-on’s
settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on, however, because they allow you to take advantage of some of Ecwid’s essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you won’t be able to access or use your account at  my.ecwid.com or to enter comments and questions on our community forums. You will be able to browse Ecwid.com, to use our knowledge base ( https://support.ecwid.com ), and to read community forums.
Web Beacons
We use Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about usage of Ecwid.com and user interaction with emails from Ecwid.com. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the Web beacon. For example, we may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify Ecwid.com when you click on a link in the email that directs you to Ecwid.com. Ecwid uses Web beacons to operate and improve Ecwid.com and email communications.
Ecwid may use information from Web beacons in combination with data about users to provide you with information about Ecwid.com and the Services.

Third Party Cookies
We occasionally engage third parties to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from users of Ecwid’s user interfaces, including our website, Ecwid.com. We also may use other
third-party

re-associated
with personal information after we receive it.

Ecwid is not responsible for the privacy of information you choose to disclose in these forums.
Users may elect to use our WebPartner Affiliate Program to inform friends about Ecwid. We request the name and email address of each referred friend. Ecwid will send a

Security
To prevent unauthorized access, promote data security, and encourage appropriate use of information, we use a variety of tools, such as encryption technologies, passwords, physical and electronic security, or procedural safeguards to assist in the protection of your information. No security on the Internet is absolute, however, so we are unable to guarantee the security of any information that you share with us.
