DIGITAL ADVERTISING
In our efforts to deliver relevant digital advertising to you, we utilize cookies and beacons to evaluate our Sites and our Apps to track digital advertising performance. To do this, we engage third party service providers to conduct these activities on our behalf. We call these third parties "Analytics Providers" and we use them to enhance Online Behavioral Advertising, or "OBA." OBA helps us to deliver advertising content that is more likely to be of interest to you, and we use OBA information and other information about your activities on our Sites and Apps to help us determine which of our ads are more likely to appeal to you. The digital advertising information collected by our Analytics Providers is anonymous. For more information on your choices regarding OBA, please visit http://www.youradchoices.com.
COOKIES AND BEACONS
A cookie is an electronic file our Sites place on your computer to store information that makes your visit to our Sites and your use of our Apps more efficient. Cookies let our Sites and Apps recognize if your computer or mobile device has visited our Sites or used our Apps before, and what security requirements and browser preferences your computer or mobile device requires. We only use cookies to provide better services and more effective Sites and Apps. Additional information about cookies and how they work is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.
"Beacons" include small graphic files with a unique identifier that are used to track a visitor to our Sites or user of our Apps online movements over time and across different websites. Unlike cookies, beacons are embedded on websites, not downloaded on your computer or device. Bank of the West uses beacons to better manage content on our Sites and to improve the use and efficiency of our Apps.
We allow selected Analytics Providers to place cookies and beacons through our Sites. We do this to get better insights into the use of the Sites, to improve our understanding of our users' demographics, and to engage in Online Behavioral Advertising.
GEOLOCATION AND ONLINE TRACKING
When you visit our Sites, you may be asked if you would like to share your location with the Bank. You must opt-in to sharing your location before we will collect it, and the decision to share your location is entirely up to you. As we discussed above, we use this information to offer location-specific services, like helping you find our ATMs and our branches.
Our Apps do not automatically collect location information from your device. However, our Apps use, but do not store, certain location-based data from your mobile device to help you find our branches or our ATMs. If you do not wish to use these location features, you should review your mobile device's settings and disable location services.

Encryption: When you log in to any of the Bank's online services using our Sites or Apps, your login information is protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, a security protocol that helps to ensure the data sent over the Internet between your computer and us remains confidential.

Secure Passwords: If you bank online with us, we provide an additional layer of security for your information by the mandatory use of a username and password to access account information. It is important that your password is kept confidential. Your password should be unique and difficult to guess and ideally should have both lowercase and uppercase letters and also numbers and special characters.
Site Confirmation: Bank of the West secure websites use Extended Validation Certificates to provide greater assurance you are communicating with the Bank and not another site that falsely claims or pretends to be the Bank. These certificates activate a green address bar and padlock in major browsers. To thwart "spoofing" (also known as page stealing) of our Sites, we have added an additional layer of security called VeriSign. The VeriSign seal allows you to verify the legitimacy of our Sites. Visitors to our Sites are able to click to a certification page that authenticates the Sites as being ours. Look for the VeriSign icon on our Sites.
