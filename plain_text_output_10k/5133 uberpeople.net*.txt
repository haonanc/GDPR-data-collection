Yep read it in detail last night.
Was fine with most of it but accessing my contact lists for the purpose of marketing or contacting them. I'm going to have to start asking my friends to delete me off their phone's.
I get it....if they want to access it for the purpose of pulling in address info to make the experience better to order an Uber. But anything else and that's just stealing in my book.
Yep welcome to the new world we live in.

Yeah! And our privacy as a driver? Riders will be able to see what rating we give them.

There is a new Driver Privacy Policy effective July 15, 2015. Drivers should receive an email on this.

So basically Drivers' contacts will be spammed with offers to sign up to drive for Uber.

Well, I'm glad I use an old iPhone with no info on it. No contacts, no calls(has no sim) only uber partner's app.
And, just deleted rider app from my regular phone.
#UberFAIL again!

The government needs to step in pass a law and stop all this snooping.

When I first started back in June 2014 I got the FREE uber phone, then on about August they started the $10 / week charge. At that time fares were good, all is good and I paid it.
Then October comes the first rate decrease from $1.50>$1.20 per mile. That made a huge difference.
So, the iPhone 6 came around and I wanted it!
Bought it, and kept my 5.  Erased all content and been running it ever since just for uber.
Best decision ever made.

Everything needs tons of access, it doesn't mean they use all of those things.  I needs Camera, for example, so that you can take pictures of the puke and send them in.  My internet browser, for example, needs even more information than this.  I don't really see what they could possibly need access to my contacts for though.
