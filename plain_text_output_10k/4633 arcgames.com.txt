What is personal information?
As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, email address, or other account number), and information about that individual’s location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Service, IP addresses or mobile device identifiers, when directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information also includes demographic information such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies you. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Service or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.
What personal information do we collect?
Active Collection
Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit or use our Service. For example, we may collect your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account, apply for a job, or contact us by email or other means for any reason. When you make a purchase, we may also collect your credit card or other payment or billing information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting content, sending an email or message to another user or participating in any interactive chat rooms, forums, social media platform or other features on the Website or Service, or when you use our Games. In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in connection with your voluntary participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities. You can access certain portion of our Service without providing us with any personal information. However, you will not be able to utilize certain features that require registration or receive materials unless certain information is provided. From time to time we may change the information requested upon registration or with respect to certain features or services, so this may not be a complete list.
From time to time we post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on the Service which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@perfectworld.com
