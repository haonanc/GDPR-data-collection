This Privacy Policy applies to the Christopher & Banks family of companies, which is comprised of Christopher & Banks, Inc. and all of our current and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (meaning corporations under the same control, to which we may refer as “Legal Affiliates”, and collectively with Christopher & Banks, Inc., as “we”, “us”,“our”, “Christopher & Banks”, and the “Company”) and to include our Website which is operated with the assistance of certain third parties. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other companies or websites, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of websites operated by others, even if they are linked to our Website. This Privacy Policy specifically does not apply to businesses that we may refer to as “Marketing Affiliates”, “marketing partners”, “third party partners” or “vendors”, all of which are unrelated to us.
WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
We collect a variety of information about our in-store and online customers and Website visitors. This section describes the information we collect. The information you provide may be used by the Company in our retail business, our online business, to fulfill orders, to operate our loyalty program and our private label credit card program and to communicate with customers regarding offers of goods, promotions or other benefits from us or our third party partners that Christopher & Banks reasonably believes may be of interest to all or certain of our customers based upon customer demographics, buying history or other reasons. Information Collected Automatically. Each time a computer or other device (collectively, a “computer”) visits our Website, we may automatically collect certain information from that computer. Information that is automatically collected may include (but is not limited to) the following:
characteristics about your browser, operating system and computer you use to access our website
the name of the domain and host from which the computer accessed the Internet;
the Internet address of any website from which the computer linked;
the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using;
the date and time the computer accessed the Website; and
if you accessed our Website via a link in an email you received from Christopher & Banks, your email address,
This type of information on its own does not tell us who you are, although it may identify the computer that you are using and how you are using it. We may also combine this information with personal information you have provided to us (as described below).
Also, we may place a file or files called a “cookie”or “pixel on computers that visit our Website. These are small data files that receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. We may also use “web beacons,” which are clear image files that may be placed on a website to monitor the behavior of visiting users of the website. Web beacons and cookies may be used by us and our marketing partners to allow your computer to use all the features on our Website and to customize your experience. You may enable, disable, block or remove some types of cookies and related files on your computer by following the instructions on your Web browser. While cookies are not required to view our Website, they are necessary in order for most functions on our site to work, and therefore we recommend allowing their use. For example, without cookies enabled you will be unable to log in, make a purchase, or view your account. We use cookies for a variety of purposes, including to populate information for returning visitors who have logged into our site to give them access to personalized features and settings. We also may use cookies to recognize customer traffic patterns and site use. This information can help us improve the site’s layout and design, including the features and personalization that we can offer returning users.

We may combine this type of information with other demographic information about you or other information you provide to us.
We use a third-party service to publish ads on our behalf across the Internet. This third-party service may collect information about your visits to our Website and other websites and your interaction with our products and services, as well as with websites generally. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. They also enable us to collect the following types of information: pages visited, products viewed and/or purchased, search term usage and other common website metrics. This information helps us to learn things like what pages are most attractive to our customers, which of our products most interest our customers and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. This is often called “behavioral advertising.” This information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by many websites. Our Website does not respond to “do not track” requests from browsers, but several of our third party service providers who utilize these tracking technologies on or Website may enable you to opt out of these advertising practices. To learn more about these advertising practices or to opt out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org or aboutads.info/choices/. We also provide you with additional tools to opt out of marketing from us as explained below.
