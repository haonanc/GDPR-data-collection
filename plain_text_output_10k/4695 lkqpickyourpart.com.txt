PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE PICSART SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. THIS PRIVACY POLICY IS PART OF AND INCORPORATED INTO PICSART'S TERMS OF SERVICE ("Terms of Service"). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, YOU MAY NOT USE THE PICSART SERVICE.
This Privacy Policy applies to information (including personal information) collected through the PicsArt Service.
The What & How of Information We Collect
We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide us when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services. We may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with information we collect on the PicsArt Service; for example, when you link your account with Facebook, we might have access to your name.  We may collect information about you from other Users if they share any Content with you, send a message, image and online contact information.
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect some information. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit, including ours. Such information includes your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We also collect and combine information about devices you use to access PicsArt Servces, and information about your usage and activity on the Site.
With your permission (on download or in the app), we may access and store your device's contact list to find your friends on the PicsArt Service, to invite them, or to share your Content with them. We may also collect information about others if you use the PicsArt Service to upload, share and/or distribute Content that contains information about them, including their name, image and online contact information.
Cookies
- We automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Site and your experience on the Site. We use cookies to see which areas and features of the Site are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Site, to personalize your experience and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Site.
Content and Metadata
- We also collect and retain your metadata along with your Content. For example, your images may be accompanied by additional Content such as a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords), comments, or may include metadata like a geotag. This makes your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your photo or tag your photo using others' APIs then your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and may be searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.
Storage of Information & Transfer of Data
Most of the information we collect is retained by us on our servers. If you are using the PicsArt Service from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently the United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.
How We Use Your Information
We use information collected through the PicsArt Service:
to communicate with you or third parties;
to process your requests and transactions;
to improve the PicsArt Service;
to customize the services and/or products we provide to you;
to assist with our product and service development;

for other purposes related to our business.
With Whom We Share Your Information
Information  collected through the PicsArt Service may be shared with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf (for example, companies that provide data management or other support services to us such as data storage and Web hosting services). We may share your information  with third parties to serve you relevant advertising and market our products, but we won't sell your information.  In any case, before sharing your information with third parties, we ensure they have strong and secure data protection policies and measures in place.
Also, we may disclose the information we collect through the PicsArt Service when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to:
comply with applicable law (e.g., in response to a valid court order or subpoena);
prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft;
enforce the Terms of PicsArt Service or other agreements that govern your use of the PicsArt Service and/or our services;
to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others; or
to protect your vital interests.
If we are going to release your information in response to legal process, our policy is to provide you with reasonable advance notice under the circumstances unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2705(b)). We may disclose your information without giving you prior notice if we believe it is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this privacy policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to efforts by third parties to compel disclosure of your information, including legal orders from the government.
Your information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy.
How Long We Retain Your Information
Retention period of collected information depends on the type of information and the reasons why we collect it. In case the retention of your information is extended for a longer period for reasons we define below, we encrypt (anonymize) it to ensure it does not directly identify you. Such data is further retained until complete deletion becomes possible.
Your account information is retained while your account is active, unless you request us to delete it or remove your account. In case you deactivate/delete your account or request us to delete your information, some information may still be retained for a reasonable time to enhance your re-activation in case you decide to return to our services. We may also retain some information we believe in good faith is necessary for legal and regulatory compliance, research and development, business matters, and improvement of our Services.
In cases when you delete your information or request us to delete it, some of your information you shared through the Services may still be accessible for those with whom you shared it. For example, if you shared an image through PicsArt Services, this image may still be visible for those with whom you shared, even if we delete it from your account.
