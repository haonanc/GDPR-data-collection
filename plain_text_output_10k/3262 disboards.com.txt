You might be right....however if it it is indeed a policy change, then why not just state that? They very easily changed the policy regarding purchasing the Disney gift cards using gift cards online so why not just state that moving forward you are not allowed to buy any gift cards using gift cards in store? Seems like it is poor PR to announce to so many of us who have spoken to corporate that it is due to an computer system error which they are intent on fixing. I’m still going to hold out hope (fingers crossed)

Because it's not just a simple "We no longer can apply target gift cards/store credit towards gift card purchase", They need to get legal involved and write up new policy.  The fix is simple.  That call to corporate was not to report the "glitch", they basically told them what to say.  If it was a glitch, then management could have easily over ridden the transaction and accepted your gift cards.
By the way, how much did you actually spend to get those gift cards?

Ok, what I can't seem to understand is if you take a discounted Target gift card into their store and buy a Disney gift card with it, how are they losing money?  Do they have an extremely low profit margin on the gift cards verses say paper towels or socks?

So say you only pay $75 for the $100 target giftcards.  You take that $100 target giftcard and buy a $100 disney card.  To me it looks like a big loss for Target especially if they only make a very small % off each card sold (Read somewhere it is 1%-3%)

If they were really concerned about a 1-3% loss, why would they give redcard holders 5% off everyday?

If you pay $75 for $100 in Target GC, you are buying them from a reseller who has likely had then purchased at full price. The person who is losing $ on the transaction is the seller, not Target.

Now in the days of effective churning, sure, Target and eBay were both losing money. But those wonderful days are long gone.

True.  Good point there as well.  I guess only time will tell whether or not this "issue" will be fixed.  And what I wonder as well is, if they do not fix this, will they eventually take that 5% from our Red Cards?  As of now, what other gift cards do they still allow the 5% off to be applied to?  Anyone know?
