Brain Pickings remains free (and ad-free) and takes me hundreds of hours a month to research and write, and thousands of dollars to sustain.

Sunday newsletter
Brain Pickings has a free Sunday digest of the week's most interesting and inspiring articles across art, science, philosophy, creativity, children's books, and other strands of our search for truth, beauty, and meaning. Here's an example . Like? Claim yours:
midweek newsletter
Also: Because Brain Pickings is in its twelfth year and because I write primarily about ideas of a timeless character, I have decided to plunge into my vast archive every Wednesday and choose from the thousands of essays one worth resurfacing and resavoring. Subscribe to this free midweek pick-me-up for heart, mind, and spirit below — it is separate from the standard Sunday digest of new pieces:
“privacy policy” & “terms”
Brain Pickings is my one-woman labor of love and it has always been noncommercial. But because it’s donation-supported, credit card companies require a “privacy policy.” So here it is, in human terms and as little tyrannical legalese as possible:
I don’t retain any of your personal information without your consent. The only such consent possible is signing up for my Sunday newsletter , in which case I’ll use the email address you enter to dispatch each issue of the newsletter to you. I never share my email list with “third parties” or other such euphemisms for commercial exploitation.
There are no ads on Brain Pickings, which means none of your behavior is being stalked by cookies and ad-trackers like it is on the vast majority of the internet.
If you choose to support what I do by making a donation , firstly, thank you from the bottom of my heart; secondly, I myself don’t keep or even have access to any of your payment information — the secure service processing the donations is called Braintree, a payment platform owned by PayPal and also used by Airbnb and Uber. You can read about how Braintree protects your personal information here .
“Refund Policy”: Since Brain Pickings is free and I don’t sell anything, any payment you can make on Brain Pickings is a voluntary donation — which means that there is no such thing as a “refund” in the transactional sense. But should you want your donation returned for any reason, you can email me and I’ll happily send you the amount via PayPal or personal check.
