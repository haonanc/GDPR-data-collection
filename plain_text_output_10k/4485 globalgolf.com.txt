These are your U-try selections. Only U-try eligible clubs appear here. 2 club limit.
Our U-try golf club demo program lets you try out a brand new golf club from the game's top brands for 14 days and only $25 a club. That's right—you get a brand new, still-in-the-plastic club to try for two weeks for just $25.
You get to try it when, where, and how you want for two weeks before deciding if you want to buy it or not.
Want to test out two different brands, or two different configurations? No problem. U-try lets you try out up to 2 clubs for $25 per club.
This isn't 30 minutes on the range with range balls, a pro looking over your shoulder, and an awkward conversation at the end about whether you want it or not.
U-try gives you the freedom to test drive the club on your course, at your pace, with the golf ball you play. Use it as much as you like so you can really know what the club will do for your game before you invest in it.
If you don't love it, simply put it back in the box it came in, use the included prepaid return shipping label, and send it back to us. That's it.
If you do love it, that's awesome! You keep the club, we'll subtract the $25 trial fee off the final cost of the club, and we'll charge you the difference.
