Where will my Personal Data be processed? As part of a global group of companies, SAP SuccessFactors has affiliates and third-party service providers within as well as outside of the European Economic Area (the "EEA").

Automated tools. In addition to the information you provide, SAP SuccessFactors may also collect information during your visit to an SAP SuccessFactors website through automated tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an SAP SuccessFactors website. SAP SuccessFactors will use these automated tools and the gathered information to display personalized content and to improve its websites. Using these tools, SAP SuccessFactors is also able to collect aggregate data that is not related to a particular individual.
Unless another means to make your choice is listed below, you may refuse the use of automated tools like cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. Kindly note that the settings in your browser regarding cookies are always limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device and that, as a consequence, if you visit SAP SuccessFactors’s websites with different browsers or different devices, you have to disable the tracking cookies in the browsers of all relevant devices. Please be aware that if you do so you may not be able to use the full functionality of the relevant site.
Furthermore, SAP SuccessFactors uses the following automated tools that feature a particular opt-out mechanism beyond browser settings:
(1) Adobe Analytics. Adobe Analytics uses IP addresses to establish the approximate region where a user is coming from. Therefore, Adobe Analytics first collects the full IP address of users and then anonymizes it. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from which a user is accessing a certain website.
This information is used to display targeted content on SAP Group websites using Adobe Analytics.
You can opt out of the use of Adobe Analytics by using this link:   http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&confirm_change=1
(2) Adobe Target. Adobe Target assigns a user ID to each user who does not opt out of the tracking as described below and then creates a user profile based on this user ID by adding information about the user’s (i) browser and other device-specific information, (ii) information about usage behavior, and (iii) location data. Location data is collected by analyzing the user’s anonymized IP address: Adobe Target first collects a user’s full IP address and then anonymizes it. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from which a user is accessing a certain website.
This information is used to display targeted content on SAP Group websites using Adobe Target.
You can opt out of the use of Adobe Target by using this link: http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&confirm_change=1
(3) Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on site activity for site operators, and providing other services relating to site activity and Internet usage.
Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. It provides website visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. It can be downloaded here: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
(4) Demandbase. Demandbase uses IP addresses to establish the commercial entity of a site visitor, and the firmographic attributes of said entity. Once those attributes are known, the IP address is discarded. The firmographic information is used to display targeted content on SAP Group websites. It is not used for profiling purposes, nor does this technology collect, process or distribute any personal information.
You can opt out of the use of Demandbase by using the opt-out controls here: https://www.demandbase.com/cookies/
