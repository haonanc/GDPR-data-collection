Privacy Policy Updates
Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, Simply Hired may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Simply Hired will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at www.simplyhired.com and post notice of the change so it is visible when users log-on for the first time after the change is posted and may send you an email so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. Simply Hired encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to Simply Hired will be subject to the then-current Privacy Policy.
Information Collection and Use
You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site, to use certain services, we may require you to create an account, or we may invite you to submit questions or comments or request information, subscribe to a newsletter, participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, or message boards. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may ask that you complete and submit an online form with personally identifiable information such as your name, username, email address, zip code and contact information. If you have created an account, you may opt to provide additional personally identifiable information in your profile such as your age, gender and employment information. Providing any additional personally identifiable information beyond what is required to create an account is optional. We may use your personally identifiable information to deliver certain services, products or information you have requested, verify your authority to enter certain password protected areas of the Site, send you notices for services that you have used or that may be of interest to you, and improve the content and general administration of the Site. We may receive your personally identifiable information from our partners that provide us with third-party services so that we can customize and improve the services that we may provide to you. In particular, Facebook.com ("Facebook") will be providing Simply Hired with certain information from its registered users in order for Simply Hired to enhance the services that we provide to you. A more detailed description of how Simply Hired is working with Facebook is described below. Additionally, if you have elected to reveal your email address to other registered members, they will have access to and be able to use your email address.

We may use this information so that we can customize and improve the services that we may provide to you.
By visiting our Site, information that we receive from Facebook about you and your Friends may appear on our Site. In addition, if a user visits our Site and you are listed as a Friend of that user on Facebook, your information may also appear on our Site.

Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. Some advertisements that appear on this Site are delivered to you by our advertising partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This information allows an advertising network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.
Aggregate Information
The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, External Web Sites linked to, search terms and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, operating system and browser type, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We also may collect aggregate information such as demographics including age, occupation, gender, salary information and labor statistics. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Site and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.
