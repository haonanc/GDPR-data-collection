Salsa Labs, Inc. (“Salsa Labs,” “we” or “us") values transparency and privacy. In this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain through the platforms accessible at hq.salsalabs.org and hq.salsalsabs.com, as well as the services available via these platforms and any software or mobile application that we make available to provide access to the platforms and services (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are owned and operated by Salsa Labs, and are used by Salsa Labs’ organizational customers (our “Customers”) to conduct fundraising, relationship and event management, and advocacy activities. In providing our Services, we collect certain information about our Customers and about their prospective, past and current supporters or end users (the “Supporters”).
By accessing or using any of our Services (including by downloading our mobile application or any software, or logging into the platforms), you agree that we will collect and handle personal information as described in this Policy. Your use of our Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Policy and our Terms of Service, available at  www.salsalabs.com/terms-service , including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes. The Terms of Service are incorporated by reference into this Policy.
Scope of this Policy
This Policy is effective as of the date set forth above (the “Effective Date”). To review our legacy privacy policies, visit https://www.salsalabs.com/legacy-saas-privacy-policy . This Policy also does not apply to the information we collect via the Salsa Labs website,  www.salsalabs.com . To review our website privacy policy, visit https://www.salsalabs.com/website-privacy-policy .
In addition, this Policy does not govern our Customers’ use or disclosure of Supporter information; each Customer is required to post a privacy policy that provides notice to, and if required obtains consent from, their Supporters to the collection, use and disclosure of information by that Customer, as well as by Salsa Labs via the Services. We encourage Supporters to review the privacy policy of any website they visit, or any organization with which they engage online.
What Information Do We Collect?
We may collect information directly from Customers and their Supporters, from third parties, and automatically through the Services. Information we collect that identifies or is identifiable to a person is referred to in this Policy as “personal information.”
Information We Collect Directly From Customers. We collect information directly from our Customers, about those Customers and about their Supporters, including:
Registration: To register for the Services, Customers must provide their email address (which will also be their log-in), first and last name, and organization phone number, and must create a password. We also may collect additional optional information, including organizational annual revenue, title, and Supporter information.
Payment Details: We will also collect Customer credit or debit card information and billing and shipping address to process subscription and other payments.
Supporter Lists: In addition, Customer can input and manage Supporter lists (including name, contact information, demographic information and other details) and other individual or campaign information.
Information We Collect From or About Supporters. On behalf of our Customers, we collect payment information directly from their Supporters (related to donations or campaigns), as well as other information, such as name, contact information, demographic information and other information, Supporters submit to a Customer, via our Services.
Information We Collect From Third Parties. If our Customers have opted in or requested that we do so, we may also engage third parties to enhance Supporter lists. For example, we may provide the email addresses of Supporters to a third party and ask that they append certain social media data (e.g., Twitter handle) to the Supporter data. We do this to provide Customers with additional details about their Supporters so that they can better target them. We won’t sell Supporter lists to third parties; however, the third parties we engage to enhance Supporter lists may maintain a copy of the lists in their database for their internal purposes.
Information We Collect Automatically. We may automatically collect the following information about your use of the Services through cookies, web beacons, log files, and other technologies: domain name; browser type and operating system; pages viewed, links clicked and other activities via the Services; IP address; the length of time using our Services; access time; device ID or other identifier; location and language information. We may combine this information with other information that we have collected, including, where applicable, personal information. Please see the “Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms” section below for more information.
How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect, including personal information, for the following purposes:
Customers. Customers, generally, have access to the Supporter information we collect and maintain on their behalf; the use and disclosure of such information by our Customers is subject to their respective privacy policies, not this one. We are not liable for our Customers use of Supporter information.
To tailor the content and information that we send or display, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize experiences using the Services.
For marketing and promotional purposes. For example, we may send our Customers news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions, or to otherwise contact Customers about products or information we think may interest them. We also may use the information that we collect to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites. We do not send promotional emails to Supporters, except for, on behalf of, or under the direction of our Customers.
To better understand how users access and use our Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Services and respond to user desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes.
To aggregate and analyze campaign and Supporter information across Customers, in order to provide our Customers with recommendations and other information about how to most effectively reach individual Supporters as well as segments of Supporters. For example, we may provide recommendations to a Customer about how to effectively reach a particular Supporter (e.g., best time of day and donation request), based on information that we have gleaned by aggregating and analyzing data across Customers. However, we will not share Customer-identifying or Customer-specific information about one Customer with other Customers, without consent.
How We Share Your Information
We may share the information we collect via the Services, including personal information, as follows:

Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms
We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about the use of our Services by Customers and Supporters. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).
Do Not Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).
Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track activities on our Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Certain features of the Services will not function if you disable cookies.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track activities on the platforms and Services, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of the Services. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our Customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.
Third Party Analytics
We use automated devices and applications on the Services, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Services and, our mobile application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.

Our Services may contain links to, or appear on third-party websites. Any access to and use of such third party websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites, and we are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.
Security of Personal Information
We have implemented precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your information (including Supporter information), password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
Access to Personal Information
Customers may modify their registration information by emailing us at  feedback@salsalabs.com . Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted will remain in our systems.
