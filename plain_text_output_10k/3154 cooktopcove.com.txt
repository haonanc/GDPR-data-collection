We may use cookies, local storage, and other similar technologies in the operation of the Service. "Cookies" and "Local Storage" are small bits of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies and local storage are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. For example, we may use cookies or local storage to keep track of your preferences and your username and password. Information contained in a cookie or local storage may be linked to your personal information for this purpose. You can disable cookies or local storage, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to use many of the features of the Service.  You can remove this data anytime, by clearing the cookies  and local storage data bound to This website's domain from your browser.
IP Addresses
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. Although we do not generally collect IP addresses, we may collect and use your IP address when we feel it is necessary to protect our service, websites, customers, or others.
If you use the Service, we may collect other unique numbers associated with a computer's identity on a network.
Log Files
Other information that may be passively collected by This website is in the form of logs - files that record website activity, including how many "hits" a particular web page is getting (a.k.a. "navigational data"). These entries are generated anonymously, and enable us to gather statistics about article popularity, assess overall website activity, track interest in advertised sales, and maintain website security. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and may be combined with data collected via cookies to help us aggregate usage patterns of registered users.
