Information We Collect Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies
We use "cookies" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain features of this site. For   example, we use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use our site (e.g., which pages they   visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page). Cookies and other web technologies are also used to   support the features and functionality of our site (e.g., to track the contents of your shopping cart as you move from   page to page, etc.).

We may also use this additional information to further   personalize our site and improve your shopping experience.
Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Advertising Agents
A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website   operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. Bite Squad may use Web Beacons on the   Website and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded   services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Bite   Squad may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of   information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or   email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by   declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and   permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.
