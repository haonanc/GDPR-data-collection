Our Policy
Welcome to Anchor FM Inc. (“Anchor”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) Privacy Policy. Our services are designed to offer users (collectively, “Users,” “you,” or “your”) the opportunity to easily create and share audio recordings with other Users (“Services”). The Services are provided to you through our website (“Site”) and mobile application (“App”).
This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect through the Services, how we use and share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use, which are available at: https://anchor.fm/tos .
By providing us with your personal data when using the Services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the Services.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
When you interact with our Site or App, we collect information that, alone or in combination with other information, could be used to identify you (“Personal Data”)
1.Personal Data You Provide Us
A.Account Information
Some information is required to create an account on our Services, such as your name, email address, password, location. You may also choose to provide other types of information to make public on the Services, such as a profile photo, biography, country information, your website, and community username.
B.Social Media
You may connect to the Services using credentials from social media services such as Facebook or Twitter (“Social Media Services”). When you provide Anchor access to your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Services to access that Social Media Service, however you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Anchor).
To access your Social Media Services account, we provide a link that directs you to a Social Media Service, where you may access the Services directly. As part of the integration with the Services, the Social Media Service will provide Anchor with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, including for example to post-related meta data from your Twitter feed or Facebook wall (such as post type, date of creation, date of update, post creator, permanent link, and the number of “Likes” and “Comments”), and “friends” or other Users you are “following”.
Anchor does not download, save, or store your photos, videos, or status messages posted on your Social Media Services accounts unless you grant us permission to do so. We will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services.
When you elect to access and use the Social Media Services, you will be sharing your information (which will include personal information if you elect to share such information) with those Social Media Services and others on the Social Media Services platform. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Social Media Services and any the information you share with them is subject to their privacy policies and terms of service. As a result, Anchor shall not have any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within or otherwise accessible through the Services.
You may be able to adjust your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to control what information the services disclose to other entities, including Anchor. We suggest checking the privacy policies of the Social Media Services concerning their privacy settings and controls.
C.Posts, Following, Lists and other Public Information
The Services are primarily designed to help you share information with the world. Most of the information you provide us through the Services is information you are asking us to make public.
Your public information includes the (i) messages you post; the metadata provided with such posts, such as when you posted and the application you used to post; (ii) language, country, and time zone associated with your account; and (iii) lists you create, people you follow, posts you mark as likes, and many other bits of information that result from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for as long as you do not delete it.
The Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public posts are immediately delivered via RSS feeds and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate the Services content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.
D.Location Information
We may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your posts and in your Anchor profile and when you set your trend location on the Services. We may also determine location by using other data from your device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address.
E.Additional Information
You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find Users you know or help other Users find you. We may later make suggestions to you and other Users based on imported address book contacts. You can delete your imported address book contacts at any time.
If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize. This information enables cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting your account on the other service from the Services account.
We also collect information you choose to provide to us when you complete any “free text” boxes in our forms (for example, support request or survey submission).
