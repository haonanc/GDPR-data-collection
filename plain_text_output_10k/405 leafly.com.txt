Welcome to Leafly.com (the “Site”) Leafly.ca, Leafly.de and related sub-domains, mobile and/or software applications, provided by Leafly Holdings, Inc., and its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company and other related companies (“Us”, “We”, or Leafly). This Leafly Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the information we gather from you when you use the Site, mobile applications, and related services (together, the “Services”) and how we use, process, and disclose that information. We may add to this Policy with other notices. We may also post additional privacy statements for some portions of the Services. By submitting personal information through our Services, you expressly consent to the transfer of your personal data to our servers in the U.S. for our collection, use, and disclosure in accordance with this Policy.

Leafly provides services to users throughout the world. If you live in Canada, Leafly Canada, Ltd.C is the data controller for your information. If you live in Europe, Leafly Holdings GmbH is the data controller. If you live outside of the EU and Canada, Leafly Holdings, Inc. is the data controller.
International Privacy Laws
If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, please be aware that you are sending information to the United States where our servers are located. That information may then be transferred within the United States or back out of the United States to other countries outside of your country of residence, depending on the type of information and how it is stored by us. These countries (including the United States) may not necessarily have the data protection laws as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence; however, our collection, storage, and use of your information will at all times be governed by this Privacy Policy.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies: We also use cookies, Web beacons, and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which usually stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.

This Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for those other parties. Third-party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons through our Site (for example Google Analytics and ChartBeat) and platform device identifiers and software agents on and through our mobile Services (for example Swrve) to provide us with information about how you use and interact with our Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about your choices about information they collect from you.

The Services may also provide you with the option to share certain information from your Leafly account with social networking services like Facebook, Google, or Twitter. We are not responsible for the use or re-sharing by others of any of your information once it is made public. If you do not want your information to be made public, you should not use the Leafly Services in this manner and/or you should adjust your privacy settings on the applicable social networking service accordingly. We are not responsible for and we do not control these social networking services privacy practices. Please review the applicable privacy policy for information about how they use your information.

Data Security and Transfer
Leafly is built on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and utilizes AWS for its data storage and transfer services. Details on AWS security certifications and procedures may be found here . In addition to the security tools on AWS, Leafly takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect your Information against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, or disclosure. No company can fully prevent security risks, however. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. To help protect yourself and your information, choose a unique password for our Services and do not use a password on our Services that you would use on any other website or online service.
To the extent that Leafly’s processing of your personal information is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, Leafly relies on your consent, given through affirmative assent upon visiting the Leafly Site, to process your information data.
