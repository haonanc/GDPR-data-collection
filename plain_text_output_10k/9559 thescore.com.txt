2. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION
We collect the following types of information as follows:
Information you provide us directly: We may ask for certain information, such as your name, postal address, email address, telephone number       (collectively “PII”), and other information, from you in order to provide the Service to you, or if you contact or       interact with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may retain other information you voluntarily provide us with, including but       not limited to your comments and other content. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service,       and as further detailed below.
Information we may collect and/or receive from third parties: We may receive information about you from third parties including third party social       networking services. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third party websites and services before linking or connecting       them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. We also may collect       information about you from third party business partners, publicly available sources and our subsidiaries and affiliates.
Analytics information. We may directly collect information, or we or our third party business partners may use analytics tools to help us       measure traffic and usage trends for the Service (“Analytics Information”). Please review our Analytics and Advertising Tracking Notice       ( http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences ) for       additional information about how you can manage preferences regarding Analytics Information.
Cookies information: When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric       characters — to your device that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service       (“Cookie”). A Cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and       other actions you take on the Service), and allow us and/or our third party business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent       Cookie remains on your device after you close your browser. Persistent Cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent       Cookies can be removed by following your browser's directions. A session Cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can set your       browser to refuse certain Cookies or to indicate when a Cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability       to accept Cookies is limited or disabled.
Log file information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page or other content       within the Service. We may also receive log information relating to your device and your use of our Apps. When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain       log file information (“Server Logs”). These Server Logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (IP)       address, operating system, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing       pages, pages viewed, and other such information. The information contained in Server Logs is used to monitor, assess, manage, diagnose problems with, improve       and otherwise administer the Service.
Clear gifs/web beacons information: “Clear Gifs” (also known as web beacons) are used to anonymously track the online       usage patterns of our users. We also may use Clear Gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by       recipients. You can disable the ability of Clear Gifs to track certain information by setting your browser to refuse certain Cookies. The information allows       for more accurate reporting, monitoring and improvement of the Service.
Device identifiers: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart phones or tablets), we       and/or our third party business partners may access, assign, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more unique device-specific identifiers, such as       a universally unique identifier (UUID) (“Unique Identifiers”). Unique Identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored       on and/or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A Unique Identifier may be data stored in connection with the       device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by us. A Unique Identifier       may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A Unique Identifier may also be used to help you log in faster and enhance your       navigation through the Service.
Advertising identifiers: Advertising identifiers are unique strings associated with your mobile device provided by the operating system       (“Advertising Identifiers”). Please visit our Analytics and Advertising Tracking notice       ( http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences ) for       additional information about how you can reset Advertising Identifiers and limit advertising tracking.
Location data: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store location       data, which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device       (“Location Data”). Location Data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Location Data may be used to       personalize and customize your experience when using the Service, facilitate the functionality of certain features within the Service,       and to improve the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based       services, may not function properly if use or availability of Location Data is impaired or disabled.
Commercial and marketing communications: We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send       you electronic messages containing Service-related notices (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, feature       notifications, technical and security notices). We may also send you electronic messages containing product and/or service offerings, promotions,       invitations and special offers. You can also stop receiving electronic messages (other than Service-related notices) from us by clicking on the       "unsubscribe link" provided in such communications or by changing your account preferences or settings.
Use of certain service type information we collect: We use or may use Cookies, Server Logs, Unique Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers,       Location Data and Clear Gifs information to: (i) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit       the Service; (ii) provide personalized content and information; (iii) provide and monitor the effectiveness of the Service; (iv) monitor aggregate metrics       such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (v) diagnose or fix technology problems; (vi) help you efficiently access your information       after you sign in; (vii) provide targeted advertising to your browser or device; (viii) automatically update our App on your mobile devices; (ix) allow you       to comment on or provide content and participate in contests, special offers and/or promotions; and (x) conduct research, beta testing or surveys.

Information may be disclosed to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Who we may share your information with: We may share your information with third party business partners that function on our behalf.       Examples include, but are not limited to, companies that assist us with serving advertisement within the Service, analyzing data, and providing marketing       assistance. We may share information about you that they need to perform their functions. We will use contractual or other means to protect personal       information disclosed to such third parties. We may also share your information with any subsidiary or affiliate of ours for purposes consistent with this       Privacy Policy. Any subsidiary or affiliate of ours will be required to maintain that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Who you may choose to share Your Content with; removal of content: Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting       to the Service, such as Your Content (as defined in the Terms of Use at http://www.thescore.com/pages/terms ),       becomes available to the public, except as limited by any privacy settings made available on the Service. Subject to your privacy settings, any of Your Content       that you voluntarily make public may be searchable by others. If you remove information or content that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable       in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information or content. Please note that such removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive       removal of the content or information posted (for example, your content or information may remain visible because it was copied and posted or reposted by a third party).
What happens in the event of a business change: If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture,       securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other transaction or if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business       otherwise changes, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith.
Instances where we are required to share your information: Regardless of the choices you make regarding your information and to the extent       permitted or required by applicable law, we may disclose information about you to third parties to: (i) enforce or apply the Terms of Use or any applicable end       user license agreement; (ii) comply with law, in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process or cooperate with       government or law enforcement officials or private parties; (iii) protect our rights, reputation, safety and property, or that of our users or others; (iv)       protect against legal liability; (v) establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; and/or (vi) investigate, prevent or take action regarding       suspected illegal activities, suspected fraud, the rights, reputation, safety or property of us, users or others, violation of the Terms of Use, our policies       or agreements or as otherwise required by law.
Sharing certain service type information we collect about you: We may share certain service type information, including information obtained       through tools such as Cookies, Server Logs, Unique Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers, Location Data and Clear Gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit       pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our third party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on "How We Collect       and Use Information." We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics (such as your name and email address) and may       share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.
Ads on the Service: We may also share certain information and data, such as Location Data, browser and Cookie data, Unique Identifier data,       Advertising Identifier data and other data relating to your use of our Service, with our advertising partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of       interest to you. We may allow third party advertisers, including but not limited to direct advertisers, ad networks, ad exchanges, and private advertising       marketplaces (collectively “Advertisers”), to serve advertisements on the Service. These Advertisers use technology to send, directly to your       browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your Internet Protocol (IP) address when they do so.       They may also use other technologies (such as Cookies, JavaScript, Unique Identifiers, Advertising Identifiers, Location Data, and Clear Gifs) to compile information       about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on or off the Service and between multiple platforms such as your computer and your mobile device, measure       the effectiveness of their ads, and personalize the advertising content to your interests. You can opt out of receiving certain Cookies by adjusting your browser       settings to refuse certain Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed. Your browser settings may not permit you to block the use of certain non-Cookie technologies,       and those browser settings that block Cookies may have no effect on such techniques. You may also reset Advertising Identifiers and limit advertising tracking (See       "Your Choices About Your Information" below).
Please note that Advertisers may ask us to show an ad to a certain audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, we may (i)       determine the target audience and serve the ads to that audience, or (ii) provide certain data as described above to the Advertisers to enable them to serve the ads       to the target audience. If you respond to such an ad, the Advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.
We do not sell, rent, or share PII we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with third party Advertisers for their own       marketing purposes, unless you choose in advance to have such information shared for this purpose.
Data Analysis: We may use third-party data analysis service providers to collect data and to provide information to us on the performance of our       Service. These companies may use information about your use of the Service and other websites and mobile applications to compare information about the performance       of our Service. These companies do not use personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address or telephone number) when performing data       analysis. These companies may also use non-Cookie technologies to recognize your computer, browser or mobile device and/or to collect and record information about       your browsing activity, including your activities on or off the Service and between multiple platforms such as your computer and your mobile device. Please keep in       mind that your browser settings may not permit you to block the use of these non-Cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block Cookies may have no effect       on such techniques. Please visit our Analytics and Advertising Tracking Notice at http://www.thescore.com/pages/manage-analytics-and-ads-preferences  for more information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third party Advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such Advertisers or contact such Advertisers for more information.
