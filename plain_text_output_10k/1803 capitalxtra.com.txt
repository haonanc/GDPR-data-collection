Your location – on your first use of our app, you will be asked if we can use your location in order to offer you services and information that is relevant to your area. We will also have information regarding your general geographic location based on your IP address and the GPS of your mobile device.

We use your personal information:

To enable you to log in to your account;
To enable you to enter competitions on our websites;
To invite you to join our online research panel. If you participate, we will keep your views and any other content you provide on record, if you give your consent for us to do so;
To tell you about products, events, services and promotions that we or our third party partners are offering. This communication could be by email, phone, text or another form of electronic communication. We will only contact you if you have told us that you want to hear from us or our third party partners. If you are a registered user of a Global website, these communications may be personalised for you, based on your browsing preferences;
We will use your information to deliver targeted advertising to you when you visit our websites. This is known as online behavioural advertising (OBA). It works by giving you adverts based on the way you have interacted with the website.

None of the OBA techniques used will collect personal information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number.
If you would like more information regarding OBA and how to opt out, please visit  http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/
By opting out of personalised advertising, you will still see adverts, but they will not be tailored to your interests. You can change your preferences by clicking here.
