User Generated Content. The AHS Applications may contain review or chat areas and/or other message, communication or other mechanisms designed to enable you to communicate with others or to post content on the AHS Applications (the “Communication Services”).  Please remember that any information you disclose while participating with the Communication Services becomes public information, becomes the property of, and is subject to redistribution by, AHS.  You should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information in a submission or posting.  There is no expectation of privacy when posting or otherwise participating on the Communication Services.  If you post content, such as messages, reviews or photos, please be aware that any personally identifiable information contained in such content is accessible to registered users or visitors to that AHS Application or Communication Services and we have no control over how those users may use your personally identifiable information.  We have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content associated with the Communication Services.  We reserve the right to take action in connection with any content we deem to be inappropriate.  Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your appropriate use of these Communication Services.
Information Collected Through Technology
In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs.  As you use our AHS Applications, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our Product and Service providers to coordinate and record the activity and fill your requests for our Products and Services and information ("Usage Information").  We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.  For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our AHS Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device.  Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) for your computer or other device used to access the AHS Applications (any, a “Device”).  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the Device used to access the AHS Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our AHS Applications and the website you visit after you leave our AHS Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.  We may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the AHS Applications.
The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s).  These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.  For example, when you visit AHS Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s).  Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.  They also help us detect certain kinds of fraud. A "cookie" is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the AHS Applications.  Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with AHS Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with AHS Applications.
Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.  “Session" cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.  Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser.  "Persistent" cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.  We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.  “Flash” cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the AHS Applications may not function properly.  For instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.
Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the AHS Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.  When you access the AHS Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.  These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the AHS Applications and promotions.
We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the AHS Applications, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the AHS Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.
We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).  HTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers' cookie files.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.
In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about AHS Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.
Information You Provide About a Third Party
If you send someone else a communication from the AHS Applications, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a customer or registers with us, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other customers or registered users.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the AHS Applications, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
Information We Collect From Third Parties
We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, our Products and Services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.
Third Party Analytic Technologies
We use third parties’ analytic and tracking tools to better understand who is using the AHS Applications, how people are using the AHS Applications and how to improve the effectiveness of the AHS Applications and its content, and to help those parties serve more targeted advertising to you across the Internet or help us serve more targeted advertising to you.  Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the AHS Applications, Device Identifiers, type of operating system used and other website(s) you may have visited.  They might combine information they collect from your interaction with AHS Applications with personal information they collect from other sources.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies.
If you wish to exercise choice with respect to collection and use of the data by these third party tools, you may visit: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION
Links to other Website(s) and Communities. To the extent hyperlinks may be utilized to access external or third party website(s) and communities, you should be aware that these external or third party website(s) and communities are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this Privacy Policy.  We recommend that you check the privacy policies of each such website and community to determine how your personal information will be utilized by their proprietors.
Security. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us.  To guard your information delivered to us electronically, the AHS Applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).  SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information.  Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from the AHS Applications, and you do so at your own risk.
We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.  Also remember to log off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit.   This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.
