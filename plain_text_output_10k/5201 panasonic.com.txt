PANASONIC.COM PRIVACY POLICY
LAST UPDATED – 8/04/2016
We are pleased that you have elected to visit this Website (referred to herein as the "Website" or the "Site"), operated by, or on behalf of, Panasonic Corporation of North America on its own behalf (collectively, "Panasonic", "us" and "we").
Panasonic respects privacy rights, and is committed to safeguarding the Personal Information entrusted to us by our clients and visitors to our Website. Panasonic has implemented this Privacy Policy to govern the use of Personal Information that we collect through this Website, including Personal Information you send to us. This Privacy Policy does not govern Personal Information collected from any other source or in any other manner. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information as to: (i) the type of information that is collected, (ii) how the collected information is used and with whom it is shared; (iii) how we intend to protect the information; and (iv) how you can access such information and have it modified and/or removed.
UPDATED: 8/04/2016. This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time. We will post changes to this Website, and we reserve the right to make changes without prior individual notice. Such changes are effective upon posting. Please review this Privacy Policy often so that you will remain abreast of Panasonic's current policies, including its policies concerning the gathering and use of information that may be collected on our Website. You are responsible for making sure you are aware of the provisions of Panasonic's most current Privacy Policy. You can tell when the Privacy Policy was last modified by checking the "updated" date.
Overview -
 
California Privacy Rights. Under California law, California residents who have provided personally identifiable information to a company may have the right to request a list of all third parties to whom that company had disclosed such information for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year, along with a list of the categories of Personal Information that had been so disclosed. However, Panasonic's policy, as disclosed on this Website, does not currently permit Panasonic to share the Personal Information about you collected at this Website with non-affiliated third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes. Moreover, even if Panasonic's policy permitted the disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes, because Panasonic provides you with an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure, Panasonic does not have to provide you with such lists. If you are a California resident who would like information on how to exercise your rights concerning third party disclosures, you may send an email to  CaliforniaPrivacyAdministrator@us.panasonic.com .

Opting in and opting out of electronic communications. At certain points where Personal Information is collected on our site, there may be a box to indicate that you wish to receive certain information or communications from Panasonic. You may opt out of receiving electronic communications, such as emails from Panasonic at any time.

We'll send you updates about sales and promotions" or by sending an email to  PanasonicPrivacyAdministrator@us.panasonic.com .
Do Not Track Signals. Certain web browsers provide users with an option by which you may have your browser send a "Do Not Track" signal to websites that you are visiting, advising the recipient website that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. However, the way browsers communicate such "Do Not Track" signals is not yet uniform and accordingly, our Website does not take any action in response to such signals. In the event a final standard is developed and accepted, we may reassess how we should respond to such signals.
Use of Your Personal Information Within Panasonic. In order to provide you with efficient and reliable services and to improve product and service options available to you, Panasonic may share your Personal Information with our affiliated entities, in which case your personal information will be collected, used, disclosed, managed and stored in accordance with this policy as set forth herein. Our affiliates are companies controlled or owned by us, or companies that control us, or are under common control with us. This Website is intended for users in the United States and its territories and possessions, but if you use the Website from any country outside the United States, the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries, and by visiting the Website, you consent to these transfers as required or permitted by applicable law.
Use of Your Personal Information by Our Service Providers. From time to time, we may hire third parties to assist us with certain functions and services, such as data processing, computer software and website maintenance and development, transaction processing, promotional and marketing services, customer service, professional, legal or accounting services and/or business and sales analysis. Panasonic may share your Personal Information, without restriction (and regardless of whether you have chosen to limit our sharing of your Personal Information as collected on the Website), with such companies that we hire to perform services for us. In such situations, Panasonic requires that these companies agree to maintain the confidentiality of your Personal Information and to comply with the safeguards described in this Privacy Policy. These companies have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. Furthermore, in compliance with privacy laws, we also provide our opt-out lists to non-affiliated third party companies so that communications sent by those companies on Panasonic's behalf do not get sent to addresses appearing on our opt-out lists.
If Panasonic changes ownership. We may also share your Personal Information as required to allow for a change in ownership of Panasonic and/or any of Panasonic's affiliated entities and/or of any business(es) to which the Website relates, and the related transfer of user information to the new owner. In the event of any such change of ownership, your Personal Information will continue to be protected by the terms of this Privacy Policy unless and until you are notified of a change.
Lawful access, legal action and investigations. Your Personal Information may be disclosed to non-affiliated third parties as either permitted by, or to comply with, applicable laws and regulations. Your Personal Information may be transmitted through and stored on servers outside your home country, and may be accessed by authorities in those jurisdictions. We may disclose Personal Information if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms and Conditions, or otherwise in accordance with applicable law. For example, Panasonic may disclose your Personal Information to comply with investigations by regulatory authorities or enforcement agencies in the United States of America or elsewhere, or to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud. Furthermore, Panasonic may disclose your Personal Information if it has a reasonable good faith basis to believe that it is required to do so by law, compelled by court order or legal process, or is reasonably necessary and/or appropriate to: (i) protect the rights, property and/or safety of Panasonic or any other person or entity; or (ii) prevent or take action concerning any alleged: (a) illegal activity or (b) breach of the Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy of this Website.
Use of Cookies, Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics
The Website makes use of "cookies" - small data files which we may send to your computer on the basis of the information that we have collected about your visit. They contain information allowing us to recognize when you are visiting the Website and to keep track of your preferences. Through the use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. Cookies are stored in your computer's browser or on your hard disk and can then be retrieved by the website. This Website uses two kinds of cookies: so-called "session" cookies, which are deleted from your computer when you leave the Website and are used purely to help you to navigate around the Website; and "persistent" cookies, which remain on your computer so that the Website can recognize you when you return. The Website also uses plug-ins. A plug-in is a piece of software which the user downloads into the user's web browser that allows certain web-based software to operate. In order to interact on the Website, you may be required to install certain plug-ins.
We may also use third-party advertising companies to target and show you advertisements when you visit the Website. These third-party advertisers may send "cookies" to your computer or other device to gather information about your preferences to provide you with advertising that is more likely to relate to your interests.
If you want to delete any cookies that were already sent to your computer or personal device, please refer to your web browser's "Help" facility. In addition, most web browsers can be set to prevent you from receiving new cookies, notify you before accepting cookies or disable cookies altogether. Details about this can normally be found in the "Help" facility provided with your browser. Please note that if you disable cookies you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website's interactive functionality.
On occasion, Panasonic permits third-party advertisers and ad networks to place their own cookies on our Website to track visitors’ activities on the Site. This enables such companies to recognize visitors so that when those visitors visit a third-party website, advertising can be delivered that is tailored to their individual interests (whether for Panasonic products or for the products or services of others), based on what has been learned from the visitors’ activity on Panasonic’s Website. This practice is called “interest-based advertising,” and the practices of these third-parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.
Panasonic offers you choices about the collection of information on our Site. Panasonic adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. If you decide you do not want to receive personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks please visit  www.AboutAds.info/choices , where you can learn more about opting out from receiving interest-based advertising.”
