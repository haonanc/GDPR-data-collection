Privacy Policy
Effective as of December 8, 2016.
Boxed takes your privacy very seriously. So, we wanted to provide you some information on our privacy policy (the “Policy”). Just so we are clear, Boxed’s legal name is Giddy Inc.; but, we do business as Boxed and Boxed Wholesale (“Boxed”). This Policy also covers our affiliates, which, together with Boxed, we refer to in this Policy as the “Company,” “Boxed,” “we,” “our,” and “us.”
This Policy describes:
how we collect, and you may provide, information through our website, including the www.boxed.com domain, our mobile applications and our vendor information portal (collectively, the “Sites”);
how we use and protect information;
with whom we may share information; and
the types of information we collect.
We put forth this Policy because we want you to be aware of the information we collect and help you make an informed decision about using our Sites and services. By visiting the Sites, linked pages, features, content, or using any of our services, you acknowledge and accept the practices and policies outlined in this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, you may not access or otherwise use the Sites. This Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Sites.
1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
Information You Provide
We collect the information you enter on our Sites when you register as a member, create an account, engage in a transaction, search our products, contact us or our customer service department by telephone, email, or otherwise, or participate in events, surveys, questionnaires, contests or other promotions we may sponsor. Please note that we may collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from the Sites only when you choose to provide it to us. We use this information to correspond with you and as otherwise permitted by this Policy. The information collected may include:
Your contact information, such as your name, email address, password, shipping address, or telephone number;
Your payment information, such as credit/debit card information, billing addresses, and other billing information;
The shipping information of any third parties that you enter when shipping orders to such third parties, including their names, addresses, and telephone numbers; and
Your purchase history.
Certain information, statements, data, and content (such as photographs) which you may submit to us are likely to reveal your gender, ethnic origin, race, nationality, age, and/or other demographic information about you.
We do not knowingly collect sensitive information such as government-issued identifiers, Social security Numbers, financial account information, insurance plan information or specific information related to your health or medical conditions.
From time-to-time, we may use third-party provided widgets on our Sites to help provide products and services that we feel might be of use to you. These widgets may ask you for additional information, such as the referral information (names and email addresses) of people or companies that you may wish to refer to us, pursuant to the privacy policies of such third parties. Of course, it is up to you as to whether you provide any of this type of information.
Mobile Web and IOS and Android Apps
We may collect certain additional information from you when you access the Sites with mobile devices or with our IOS and Android mobile apps (the “Boxed Apps”). This information may include location, device type, unique device identifier, mobile operating system, site navigation, and other app-specific user data. When this data is collected, it is analyzed periodically to help us create a more user-friendly, improved shopping experience within the mobile web interface and/or the Boxed Apps. You may restrict the collection of certain data, like location, and/or opt out of notifications from the Boxed Apps by changing the settings preferences on your mobile device.
Automatically Collected Information; Interest-Based Advertising.
When you interact with the Sites, advertisements or other content provided by Boxed or third parties, on behalf of Boxed, through your computer, phone or mobile device (we’ll refer to these as “Devices” throughout the Policy), we, and third parties, automatically collect non-personally identifiable information (“Non-PII”) about or from your Device, such as, without limitation, your browser information on our server logs including your IP address, browser type, browser versions, browser language, browser plug-in type and version, country and time zone, URLs that refer visitors to our Sites, dates and times of visits to our Sites, page views and site navigation, geographic location, cookie information (see below), web beacons, pixel tags, device fingerprinting or other means, the page you requested, duration of activity on our Sites, searches, shopping behavior and preferences, hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, and purchases.
We may use this information, and tie it back to the information you provide to us, to tailor or customize your shopping experience and/or interaction with Boxed, allowing us to surface various products and special offers in which you may have interest. This form of advertising, sometimes called “behavioral advertising,” is based on anonymous information and not on any personally identifiable information. As a result, we and our vendors know your interests, but cannot personally identify you in connection with the delivery of that specific ad. We believe that such advertising is helpful because you will see advertisements that are relevant to your interests. However, if you would like to opt-out of these interest-based advertisements, please follow the opt-out process described below under “What Choices Do Users Have.”
We may also aggregate and anonymize this information with similar information from our other customers in order to understand how our customers use our Sites, and/or third party service providers may collect non-personally identifiable information from our Sites as well.
Cookies
A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use a variety of cookies, such as session, persistent and analytics cookies, among others, to identify and authenticate visitors and to store information in your electronic shopping baskets so it can be retrieved later.
By using the Sites, you accept the use of cookies as described in this Policy. You can disable or delete cookies by changing the preferences on your Device browser (usually located in the “Help” or “Tools” menu). Disabling cookies may, however, prevent you from using some of the essential features of the Sites. Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile tracking activities via their device settings. For further information, please see “What Choices Do Users Have” below. If you have any questions or need assistance regarding cookies, you can contact us at privacy@boxed.com .
We use third-party tracking services that use cookies to provide non-personally identifiable information and we also use third-party tracking services in our Sites and the Boxed Apps. These tracking services collect information about our users on an aggregate basis and such collected information is analyzed periodically to gain a greater understanding of the usage patterns within our Sites.
Web Beacons and Pixel Tags
Boxed and our Third-Party Service Providers (defined below) may use web beacons or pixel tags to control the automated collection of non-personally identifiable information. These small electronic tags on specific web pages on our Sites help us monitor the activity on our Sites in order to improve your shopping experience.
JavaScript
In order to collect the kinds of information described in this Policy and to see how you interact with our Sites, we, or third parties, may use JavaScript or other languages to send instructions to your Devices.
Do Not Track
Some browsers may provide a “Do Not Track” option which signals to websites and web services that you do not wish to have your online activities tracked over time or across different websites. A “Do Not Track” option may also allow you to opt out of behavioral advertising. At this time, the Sites neither respond to nor support “Do Not Track” requests and will continue to collect information about your online activity as mentioned in this Policy.
2. WHAT WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION
We may use the information you provide to us, directly or indirectly, and information we collect about you for various reasons, including to:

We may employ third-party service providers (the “Third-Party Service Providers”) to help, on behalf of Boxed, facilitate our services by providing analytics, results, links, advertisements, embedded content or other tools and services. These Third-Party Service Providers may collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies, pixel tags, device fingerprinting or other automated means. The Third-Party Service Providers may use this information internally or share this information with us for various purposes and reasons, including to assist us in providing a more customized shopping experience. This Policy covers on only our use of information we collect. We may use Non-PII from third parties (such as data vendors) pursuant to their own privacy policies. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our Site with Non-PII collected from our business partners.

Our Sites may contain links to websites and services, as well as other embedded content, that are owned, operated or otherwise provided by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”).

7. HOW INFORMATION IS PROTECTED AND CHECKOUT SECURED
We implement reasonable measures to protect your information through a variety of safeguards designed to help protect the information we collect and store against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.
No method of protecting information is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, we suggest that you take certain reasonable steps to protect your information. Start by safeguarding your own account username and password and not sharing that information with anyone. It is preferable that users update their password periodically and follow conventions for choosing a secure password. If users are concerned about misuse of their identity within the Sites, or are using a shared device, users should make an effort to log out as often as necessary. We will never ask for your password via email and users should report any such inquiry.
We retain your PII, if provided by you through the Sites, for as long as your inquiry is active (as determined by us) and for a reasonable time thereafter, or if applicable, for as long as you remain on our marketing list. Even if we delete some or all of your PII, we may continue to retain and use aggregate, anonymous data previously collected and/or anonymize and aggregate your personal information. Please note that we will not be liable for disclosures of your data due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.
