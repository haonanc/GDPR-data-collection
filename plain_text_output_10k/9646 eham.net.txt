eHam.net has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate            our firm commitment to your privacy. We recognize that our members            are our most important asset, and we strive to protect their            interests at all times. We commit to keeping individual and            community interests paramount and protecting the confidentiality of            our members. We avoid asking for information from our members, unless            we feel it is necessary for security or we feel the information is            necessary for the application. Any information supplied to us by            our members will not be sold or offered to any third party without            the express written consent of our members.
Since privacy is so     important to us, we will always give you an opportunity to view,      change, or delete certain personal information (see callbook ) that we gather from you.  This     information is stored to improve your eHam.net experience, and is     in no way used by the site owners, advertisers, or anyone else but you.
Please realize that eHam.net is NOT ham radio, but a website and as         such, does not and cannot follow the same rules.  Users do NOT have to         use legitimate callsigns to log in, your words are permanently         available for all to see, and DX doesn't count for any awards.
Cookies
The use of HTML cookies is now optional.  Please read our updated FAQ page . Basically, we use them for security          so that other members cannot post information on the site with your          Callsign and to allow users to come back to the site without having          to sign in again.  Signing in has its benefits .
Public Forums
This site makes various forums available to its members. Please            remember that anything            that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You            should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal            information, or points of view. Posts will be subject to rebuttal by            other members, some of it aggressive in nature.  Keep in mind, they            are your words, and they can be used against you!
In general, we are reluctant to delete any posts as doing so            potentially disturbs the continuity of the thread.  We will do so,            and without warning, if the posts are deemed undesirable by the            eHam.net staff.
Callbook
One aspect of Amateur Radio that is different from many other pursuits  is that it requires a license from a government authority.  In the USA,  for example, this is the FCC .
The name and address (callbook) information of  US hams  displayed on eHam.net is in the public domain and downloaded directly  from the FCC site on a regular basis. It is eHam.net's policy to provide  this information as a service to our users and hams around the world who  often use this information for QSLing.  We cannot edit or otherwise  disable any of it. This same information is available on numerous other  websites and in various other (print, CD-ROM) media.
Please contact the FCC if you wish to change it or otherwise make it  unavailable.
Choice/Opt-Out/Modify
This site gives members the following options for removing their            information from our database to not receive future communications            or to no longer receive our service.
Email addresses
As with most topics, be sure to see the FAQ pages for more info on email addresses.
Other than picking a username and a password for logging in, the only         information that eHam.net requires for a user to become a         "registered" member is a verified email address.  Whenever a user         enters a new email address, the user is emailed verification         instructions. We require a validated email address to prevent         registration abuse and so that certain functions like hints and         resets for passwords will operate properly.         The addresses are also used for automatic emails such as         notifications that your submission ( articles or strays ) has been activated, and for         features like classifieds that require, for example, buyers to get in touch with sellers.         Email subscriptions to forums topics also         require a valid email.
Editing email addresses
Log in, then go to your profile page, then         click the basic user info link near the top.
Hiding email addresses
While email addresses are required for membership, users can  opt to "hide" it from other users by going to their personal profile edit page, UN-checking the "Include  your email..." box and be sure to click the "submit" button at the  bottom.
NOTE: Even if you elect to "hide" your email address, it will still be viewable         in any classified ads that you will place.  This is to assure that others         can contact those whom place ads.
Other (non-email) information
Logged-in users are always welcome to add or delete other information         from their profile .
