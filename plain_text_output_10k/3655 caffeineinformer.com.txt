For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
With your consent.
10. Submissions
Any personal information you choose to provide to us with your submissions posted to the Websites may appear on public areas of the Websites, but only to identify you as the author of the submission, unless you expressly authorize us to make further use of the information on the Websites. If you voluntarily disclose or permit disclosure of personal information, that information can also be collected and used by others. Your submissions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. If you submit to the Websites any comments, photographs, videos, music, text or other content, you grant to INFORM the unlimited, perpetual, royalty-free right to use your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with such submission in any media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the world. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Websites with whom you may choose to share your submissions. Thus, we cannot and do not guarantee that your submissions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.
11. Privacy Policy for Children Under 13
Our Websites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on the Websites. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (commonly referred to as “COPPA”), we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any personal information on the Websites. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at legal@inform.com .
12. Partner Sites / Linked Sites
Our Websites feature several activities, which are co-sponsored or operated by other sites. These activities will be identifiable by their co-branding. While these activities originate on the Websites, they may link to other sites not operated by INFORM. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third parties, including those that may disclose information to INFORM. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our co-sponsors and strongly recommend that you check their privacy policies before engaging in these activities. You may be asked to provide information about yourself to register for a service offered by a co-branded partner. In doing so, you may be providing your information to both INFORM and the co-branded partner, or we may share your information with the co-branded partner. Additionally, our Websites contain links to other sites, including those of advertisers. We have no control over the privacy practices of advertisers or other sites to which we provide links from this site. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off this site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data or solicit PII. We strongly recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of the site to which you are linking.
13. Security of Information
We use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your PII secure. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take care to protect your PII, INFORM cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Websites.
The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you a password for access to certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask that you not share your password with anyone. We also urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Websites like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Websites.
14. Transfer of Data Internationally
INFORM is headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of the Websites may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or another country in accordance with applicable law. The privacy and data protection laws in another country may not be equivalent to such laws in your country of residence. By using and participating in the Websites or providing us with your information, you consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of your information.
15. Your California Privacy Rights

If you delete your submissions from the Websites, copies of your submissions may remain viewable in cached or archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users of the Websites.
