I. Personally-Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
Etison, LLC (also referred to herein as “ClickFunnels”) may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). PII that we collect is information that identifies you as an individual – and includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, billing address and shipping information. Non-PII is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools and other information that does not reveal your specific identity. PII and Non-PII may be collected anytime you access or use a ClickFunnels website. PII and Non-PII may also be collected by ClickFunnels during in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications. ClickFunnels also collects information via cookies; blocking cookies may render you unable to access certain ClickFunnels products, services, or websites. 
ClickFunnels uses PII to respond to your inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of services ClickFunnels thinks may be of interest to you, and otherwise personalize your experience with ClickFunnels, and other reasons. ClickFunnels does not sell or lease PII about you to others, and may in some cases be liable for so doing under the Privacy Shield Framework outlined below. ClickFunnels will provide your e-mail address to affiliates or users who refer you to us, or through whom you create a ClickFunnels account. ClickFunnels shares your PII with ClickFunnels affiliates and third parties contracting with ClickFunnels to provide services to you, including financial institutions, API integrators you have chosen, and other third party software services that you have chosen to assist you with your sales funnels. ClickFunnels employees who design our databases and software, and those employees who provide you with customer service, along with our customer service software partners, also have access to PII as part of their job in providing services to You. ClickFunnels may also share PII when required by law, or when you have expressly requested ClickFunnels to do so. ClickFunnels reserves the right to disclose and use your PII if ClickFunnels believes it is necessary to: (a) respond to legal process, e.g., a subpoena; (b) respond to a law enforcement agency’s request; (c) enforce the Terms; or (d) protect the rights, privacy, safety, property, or operations of ClickFunnels or third parties; 
Because Non-PII does not personally identify You, ClickFunnels reserves the right to use and disclose to third parties Non-PII for any purpose. 
ClickFunnels maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect PII from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. ClickFunnels enforces its Privacy Policy via self-assessment. 
ClickFunnels reserves the right to change this privacy notice, which changes will become effective upon posting of the revised notice on https://www.clickfunnels.com/privacy ,or upon emailing of the changes to You at the email address You provided to ClickFunnels, or as required by law.
