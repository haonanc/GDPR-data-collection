Our Internet policy is:
We will not collect personal information about you just because you visit this site. In order to improve the usefulness of our web site for our visitors, we automatically collect and maintain statistical information from our site's data logs that concern network traffic flow and volume.

When you visit schneider.com, we send one or more cookies - a small file containing a string of characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking user trends, such as what area of the site visitors most visit. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or to let you know when a cookie is being sent. However, some schneider.com features and services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
We use these web pages to provide information pertaining to the Schneider and its recruitment efforts.

We will not share the information you give us with anyone unless required by law. We also will not sell your information.
