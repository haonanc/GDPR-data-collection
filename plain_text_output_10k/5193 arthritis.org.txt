Constituent Privacy Policy
The Arthritis Foundation respects the privacy of each individual who contacts us. We are grateful for your support and the crucial roles you play in helping us continue our valuable work. As part of our commitment to safeguarding your privacy we have adopted the online privacy policy outlined below, which is applicable to all Arthritis Foundation web sites (“Sites”).
Collection of Information
We collect two kinds of information, general usage data, which is not individually identifiable, and individually identifiable information. 
General Usage Data
Our Web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name of each visitor to the Sites. We collect information about visitors to the Sites, such as the number of visitors, what pages they access, and the length of their visit. We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit the Sites or fill out forms such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows Vista, Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., AT&T, Comcast). This information is used in aggregate form in order to manage our web sites and improve its content. 
Individually Identifiable Information
We collect individually identifiable information about you when you choose to share information about yourself, for example, when you make a donation, request information or sign up to be an advocate. This information may include, but is not limited to, your postal or e-mail address, your telephone number and the type of arthritis you have.
In addition, through the use of tools like Track & React, you will have the opportunity to submit personal health information.  Personal health information is not shared except as in accordance with HIPAA regulations.  In addition, personal health information that is associated with your profile and can be updated at any time by logging in and changing your information.
Use of Information
Individually identifiable information is used to provide you with information or to deliver the service you have requested and to provide you with additional services that we believe may be of interest to you. If you provide your postal address, telephone number or e-mail address to the Arthritis Foundation online, you may receive periodic contacts from us.
If you would like to change the way we contact you, please fill out the Privacy Preference Form .
At certain parts of the Sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to use tools or otherwise participate in the Sites' activities and offerings.
Community Tools
Some portions of the Sites, such as RA Connect, provide special services and offer interactive tools that allow users to upload information for public consumption. In some cases, users can share experiences, give advice and connect with others.  Please remember that chat rooms, message boards and personal pages are public forums and personal information disclosed there will be seen by others. In addition, please exercise caution when posting information or providing information about yourself to others, especially contact information, such as street address, telephone number or email address. This privacy policy does not apply to any information posted by you in a public area of the Sites.
Cookies
We use a technology called a "cookie" to recognize you when you return to the Sites. Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a web Sites can transfer to a user’s hard drive to help tailor the user experience to the users’ preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. If you wish, you may direct your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that if you block cookies, some Sites functionality may be lost. For more information, see our Sites Help Tips .
Sharing Information With Others
From time to time, the Arthritis Foundation may make your personally identifiable information available to other worthy nonprofit and commercial organizations whose services may be of interest to our supporters. Any disclosure of personal health information shall only be done in accordance with HIPAA regulations.  We carefully screen these organizations. If you do not want us to share your information with other companies or organizations, please fill out the Privacy Preference Form .
At times we may offer programs (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) that are sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the Sites activity. The Arthritis Foundation has no control over the third-party's use of this information.
We may share your personally identifiable information with affiliates and third parties, including e-commerce partners, who assist us by providing services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, credit card processing, fulfillment and shipping, database management, e-mail distribution, and Web Sites management.   [Such parties may only use your personally identifiable information for the specific purpose for which they are provided the information.]
In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of our assets relating to the Sites are sold or transferred to another party, your personally identifiable information may be transferred to this acquiring entity. Finally, we may disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in order to comply with law, law enforcement agencies, to protect our rights in or the safety of the Sites, or to protect the safety or rights of other users of the Sites.
Email Communications
We occasionally send out an email newsletter and direct email communications to Arthritis Foundation constituents to highlight news, information and opportunities available from the Arthritis Foundation. You can elect not to receive communications from us, either by completing our privacy preference form , or by noting your preference in response to communications from us. You may also select to receive only certain publications from the Arthritis Foundation by registering on our web sites and selecting your newsletter preferences. In addition, all Arthritis Foundation e-newsletters and direct email communications have easy-to-follow unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each e-mail piece.
Links to Other Sites
Our Sites provides links to other web sites where you can find out more about our sponsors or products. Please note that the Foundation is not responsible for the information practices of linked Sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each Sites you visit.
Children Online
Information Collected
The Arthritis Foundation produces a web site section ( www.kidsgetarthritistoo.org ) that is intended for use by children, including those under the age of 13 years. Protecting the privacy of children is especially important, and for this reason we have adopted certain policies and procedures. We do not collect any more personal information than reasonably necessary to enable children to participate in the activities we offer at our web site.
As described in this Privacy Policy, we directly collect personally identifiable information from a child when a user submits a form through our web site. This information may include the child's name, age, and gender. We also request a name, email address, mailing address and telephone number of the child’s parent or guardian so that we may seek parental permission to post personal stories submitted by the child.
Please note that parents may consent to the above collection and use without necessarily consenting to the disclosure of personal information to third parties.
We do not have any agreements with outside organizations to collect personal information at our site.
Use and Sharing of Information
The information we collect from children is compiled personal stories that may be published only after obtaining parental permission.
We do not share children’s personal information with anyone other than those who provide support for the internal operations of the web site and our agents (e.g., contractors who provide fulfillment services or technical support to the web site).
All third parties with whom we share information have agreed to maintain security and integrity of personal information.
Parental Review
Parents can review the information that we have collected from their children online, prevent the further use or maintenance of such information, or direct the deletion of their children’s personal information by calling us at the telephone number provided above, emailing us at the above address and/or writing to us at the above address. 
Security
In order to prevent unauthorized access and protect our users’ personal information, we strive to maintain physical, electronic and administrative safeguards to secure the information we collect online. For example, online shopping and contributions are processed using a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect your information, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply to us will not be intercepted while in transit to us over the Internet.
For areas of our sites which require a login, you must help us protect against unauthorized access by keeping your password in a safe place and signing off when using a shared computer. We ask that you do what is reasonable to ensure the security of your personal information.  We also take steps to ensure the security of your personal health information.  All personal health information within tools like Track & React is encrypted to ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations. 
Should you engage in harmful or dangerous activities that violate the reputation of the Arthritis Foundation, our users or any other person, your access may be terminated, without notice. Your account may also be terminated for extended periods of inactivity.
Privacy Policy Changes
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes here and the last date on which the privacy policy was updated will be listed below. We encourage you to review our policy from time to time.

Collection and Use of Personal Data Privacy Statement
Our Commitment to Privacy
The Arthritis Foundation respects the privacy of every individual who contacts us. We are grateful for your support and committed to protecting your privacy. This notice supplements our Online Privacy Statement and describes our practices for safeguarding personal information provided by individuals who contact us offline.
How We Collect Your Information
The Arthritis Foundation may collect information from individuals who contact us via mail, phone or events. An Arthritis Foundation representative will generally ask of you the following information: name, address, phone number and contact preferences (“Contact Information”). They may also ask you whether you would like to receive information about the Foundation including information about making voluntary time and monetary contributions to the Foundation. If you call seeking patient-related arthritis information, an Arthritis Foundation Representative will ask for the type of arthritis and if your arthritis is doctor-diagnosed (“Health Related Information”). This information enables us to better assist you. All information you provide is voluntary.
In addition to information that you provide to us, we sometimes obtain additional information that is publicly available. This may include standard Contact Information, such as your name, phone number, and address. Other information depends on the activity.
For memorial contributions or contributions honoring an individual, we ask that you provide Contact Information of the person to whom you would like a personalized gift card sent. The information we collect is used to send the gift card and for informing the recipient of other Foundation programs and services and for no other purposes.
Data Use
We limit the use of the information you provide to us to the following:
If you provide Contact Information, we enter your name into our constituent database and contact you in order to:
Supply you with information including arthritis related health news, Foundation programs and events.
Request voluntary time or monetary contributions to the Foundation.
Seek completion of voluntary surveys seeking feedback for quality and service improvement purposes.
Any Health Related Information you provide is strictly limited to access within the organization for purposes of serving you and providing you with relevant information and will never be shared outside of the organization.
We may occasionally make your postal contact information available on a limited basis to other reputable nonprofit or commercial organizations whose services we believe may be of interest to you.  We carefully screen and approve these organizations. If you do not want us to share your information in this manner, contact us via mail, phone or online at the address below, listing your name, postal or e-mail address and telephone number, and telling us that you do not want us to share this information.  Because we exchange names with these organizations, it is a cost effective method of reaching additional potential constituents and we hope that you value the information they send you. Your name is only made available to these carefully screened organizations through third-party mailing agents for a limited use. Other organizations will not have continued access to your name and address unless you choose to respond to their initial mailing. We do not share email addresses or Health Related Information.
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf. We only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose.
We will also share personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our rights, or protect the safety of our constituents or others.
Aside from the above, we may disclose Contact Information we collect about you to third parties with your consent or at your direction.
