Protecting your data
Stewardship of your personal data is critical to us and a responsibility we embrace. We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

Where we store and transfer your data
The EU and the United States. We have customers all over the world but to provide you with services, we store, use and transmit information only in the United States and the European Economic Area (EEA).
In relation to personal data of individuals in the European Union, we may share your personal data within the Company. This may involve transferring your data outside the EEA. We may also share your data with trusted third parties who assist us in providing, improving, protecting and promoting our Services and this may also involve transferring your data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data outside the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
Where we transfer your data outside the EEA within the Company, your data will be transferred to the United States. The Company complies with the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the EEA. This means that we have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles which require us to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the EEA and the US. To learn more about the Privacy Shield and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov .
Where we transfer your data to third parties, we will  transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission (for further details, see  Adequacy decisions of the European Commission) , or we will use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe (for further details, see  International data transfers using model contracts).
In compliance with the US-EU and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with questions or concerns about the use of their Personal Data should contact us at: dpo@talentinc.com
If your question or concern cannot be satisfied through this process we are further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under US-EU Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield to an independent dispute resolution mechanism operated by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS).
If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, EU and Swiss individuals may bring a complaint before the JAM EU and Swiss Privacy Shield program can be found at: www.jamsadr.org. Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU and Swiss individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism. We are committed to cooperate with EU and Swiss data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland.
Changes to our Company
If we are involved in a reorganisation, merger, acquisition, or sale of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (e.g. via e-mail to the e-mail address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.
We may revise this privacy policy from time to time and will post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
