5. How We Use Personal Information
CoStar uses your personal information only for specific purposes. The personal information you provide to us when using our Site, such as your name, postal or e-mail address or telephone number will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with CoStar, and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products and services from CoStar, to conduct research, or to provide offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of CoStar that are given access to your personal information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for CoStar.
CoStar may combine personal information collected at its Site with data provided by third-parties for the purposes of offering you products and services that CoStar believes would be of interest to you. If CoStar obtains information from third parties other than public sources, CoStar requires those third parties to confirm that they have complied with applicable law in the collection and use of that information.
Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal information to third parties for purposes other than to support your customer relationship with CoStar, such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information), or if disclosure is permitted or required by law (for example, in connection with judicial proceedings or governmental investigations). CoStar also reserves the right to disclose your personal information to identify possible violations of the Terms of Use or a separate License Agreement, to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be violating your rights, our rights or the rights of others.
6. Data Processing
CoStar’s global corporate affiliates assist us in supplying and providing services to our customers. In addition, CoStar retains subcontractors, agents, advisors and suppliers to assist us in our business. CoStar may permit its affiliates and third parties to access your personal information in order to assist us; however, these parties must keep your personal information confidential and must not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for CoStar.
CoStar may process and store your personal information in the United States of America. In addition, some of our service providers, agents and suppliers are located outside of Canada. Your personal information will also be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions, which may not provide the same level of protection as Canadian law.
7. Consent
CoStar obtains your consent for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information for the purposes of providing you with products and services by you giving us your personal information for those purposes. We use an opt-out standard for communications with you about our products and services and other products or services that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please contact us by e-mail to  mklionsky@costargroup.com . In addition, you can select unsubscribe on any of our electronic email marketing communications to you. If you opt-out of marketing communications, CoStar will still contact you in connection with providing you with the products and services you have requested from us.
8. Retention
CoStar retains personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and as required to comply with business and legal requirements. The length of time CoStar retains personal information varies and may extend beyond the end of the individual’s relationship with CoStar.
9. Security
CoStar takes steps to protect the security of the personally identifiable information we collect, including, for example, physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards.
10. No Data Regarding Children
Although the Site can technically be viewed by children, we do not knowingly request personally identifiable information from them nor does the Site publish content that is targeted to children. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Site by visitors under the age of 18.
