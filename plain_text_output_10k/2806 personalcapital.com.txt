We use this information to ensure that our web sites function properly and for security purposes.
Your Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computing device you are using. Cookies we use do not contain or capture Personal Information. Cookies allow us to collect information such as your browser type, time spent on our web sites and which of our pages you visited. We use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience and to recognize authorized devices to secure your use of our services. We also gather statistical information about web site usage in order to continually improve the design and functionality and to assist us with resolving technical support questions. Additionally, we use cookies on our web sites and the sites on which we advertise to track advertising performance and to collect aggregate data on web page viewing and mobile app usage. Cookies may be connected to third-party companies or websites. The privacy practices of the companies placing such cookies are governed by the privacy policies of such third-party companies or websites. As an example, Google Analytics measures the performance of advertisements by placing cookies on your computer when you click on an advertisement.

For All Personal Capital Users
To protect users’ Personal Information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with relevant laws and regulations. Beyond this Privacy & Security Statement, we provide additional security measures, such as:
Bank Level Security: Personal Capital is powered using technologies and practices that many banks and other financial institutions use to protect customer information, such as SSL encryption for data in transit and AES encryption for sensitive data at rest. After initial account aggregation, we do not store your financial institution credentials in our systems or in our applications. Our Dashboard is provided by an industry-leading third-party account aggregation service. (See “With Whom We Share Your Personal Information” above.) That service employs comprehensive financial data security standards and is subject to ongoing multi-agency financial institution regulatory examinations.
Device Authentication: When you register for our Dashboard or log into your Account to use the Dashboard, we recognize your device for enhanced security. If access to your Account is attempted from another device, you will be notified by phone or email and access will not be granted unless you authorize the new device. Also, you may remove lost devices from your authorized device list to continuously protect from unauthorized access to your Account.
No Money Movement: While using the Dashboard through our mobile app, you can only view financial account balances and transactions. You cannot transfer money between accounts, authorize spending or move money, safeguarding you from unauthorized money transfers from your financial accounts.
Account Monitoring: Our mobile app that allows you to use the Dashboard allows you to monitor all your transactions for accounts linked to your Account, providing you with a comprehensive view of all account activities.
Reviewing and Updating your Personal Information
You can view and update the profile and information associated with your Account that we collect for you by going to the “settings” function in our website and in our mobile app. The credibility and relevance of our services depend on your providing us with complete, accurate and up-to-date information about yourself and your accounts, both now and in the future.
Email Marketing Opt-out
When we communicate our own marketing offers to you, these communications are CAN-SPAM compliant, including the ability for you to opt-out of marketing communications.
Deletion/Retention of Personal Information
Unless you request otherwise, we will retain the Personal Information we collect from you indefinitely.
Personal Capital, as a registered investment advisor, must comply with certain legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to record retention. We will respond to any requests we receive asking that we delete Personal Information that we possess from those who use our services, downloaded our Dashboard or registered and established a user profile. However, we will not delete information that we are required to retain in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
How to Request Deletion of the Personal Information We Collect
You may visit the troubleshooting section of our support web site for instructions on how to delete your Account .
Alternatively, you may request your Account be deleted by our support department by emailing [email protected] from the email address associated with your Account, indicating “CANCEL” in the subject line of the message. After confirming you are the Account owner we will remove Personal Information from our records and will only continue to retain such information as required by law.
Personal Capital’s Statement Regarding “Do Not Track” Signals
Most browsers can be set to send signals to third party websites requesting them not to track the user’s activities. At this time, Personal Capital does not respond to “do not track” signals. Consequently, Personal Capital, its third party service providers such as Google Analytics, and other third party websites and online services may indeed track and collect Personal Information about your online activities over time while navigating to, from and on our website and our mobile app and across those third party websites and online services, notwithstanding any “do not track” signals we may receive.
Advertising
We do not allow third party advertising on our web site or applications.
Social Media
Personal Capital may integrate authentication or social experiences on social media platforms such as Facebook®, Twitter®, Google Circles and LinkedIn® that enable login or online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to use such social media platforms. Any content you post, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any Personal Information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those platforms. Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.
Protecting Children’s Privacy Online
Personal Capital is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and those children should not provide Personal Information through our web sites or applications. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 without parental consent.
