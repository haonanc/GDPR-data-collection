OUR PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES
At Quicken Loans, we want you to be comfortable and confident when using         our website. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following         principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects         of our website:
WE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEBSITE INFORMATION PRACTICES.
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from         you when you visit our websites. Quicken Loans does not share your         personal information with outside companies for their promotional use.
Here is a description of the information we collect and how it is used:
PROTECTING YOUR IDENTITY AND CREDIT
Credit reporting agencies may share your information with other companies         when you apply for a home loan. This may cause you to receive Email or         phone calls that you didn't ask for, offering credit cards, refinancing         or other loan products.
You can stop these calls and Emails by opting out of these prescreened         credit offers. Simply call (888) 567-8688 or visit www.optoutprescreen.com .
Tools, Applications and Registration: We provide a             number of ways for you to explore your options for mortgages and             loans, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable             for you. You can engage a number of tools, planners, calculators and             other interactive advisors, such as the online interviews, without             providing us your identity. We will not ask you for personally             identifiable information to use these features, and do not attribute             the information that you provide to you as an individual.
However, if you want to exercise one or more of the loan options                 presented, we will ask you to register at the site and supply                 other identifying and supporting information needed to process                 your application.
By registering, you can save information such as loan interviews                 and applications for later review and update. When you register,                 you select a member ID name by which we will know you, choose a                 password and provide us an Email address. You use the member ID                 name and password to gain access to your loan application information,                 financial profile and/or customized rates. We use your contact                 information to provide you with alerts and updates regarding your                 loan status, which is part of the Quicken Loans service. Quicken                 Loans does not share your information with outside companies for                 their promotional use. We may, however, use it to send you                 communications and special offers on other products or services                 offered by Quicken Loans. If you do not want to receive this                 information you may opt-out during registration, within any future                 communications or by sending an Email to optout@QuickenLoans.com .                 You may also click here to change                 your contact preferences.
We may also supply the information you provide, on a strictly                 confidential basis, to service providers, such as title companies,                 appraisers, credit reporting services, etc., who assist us in                 qualifying, processing, closing and servicing your loan.
Credit Report: By submitting a loan application             or a request to be pre-qualified to us, you authorize us to share             your credit report with our affiliates only to process your loan             application.
Newsletters: We provide you the opportunity to             subscribe to Email newsletters and other Email communications.             You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in             each Email newsletter.
Interactive Help (Chat / PC to Phone): You may             initiate an online interactive discussion or PC to Phone communication             with a Quicken Loans support professional to facilitate the             completion of your loan application. We do not ask for any             personally identifiable information to use this service; if you             volunteer personally identifiable information, it will only be             used to respond to your request. We maintain transcripts of chat sessions.

If you would like to participate, we may ask you for             contact information, preferences or other information. This information             may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or contact you             regarding home financing or award prizes. Our contests or sweepstakes             may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that             you supply will be used in each case.
Mandatory and Optional Information: We identify what             information is required to fulfill your request. If you chose not to             provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide you the             service you are requesting. As part of your use of our website, we             may collect information that my include your name, address, social             security number, the location and value of the property related to             the requested loan products or services, financial information about             your assets and income, financial accounts, insurance and other             information. As part of this process, you consent to Quicken Loans             obtaining a credit report and for us to use that information as             described in this policy. We will also collect information about your             activity on the Quicken Loans websites and use that information as             described in this policy.
E-mail Message Formatting: When sending you Email             we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (1)             format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities,             and (2) determine whether you've opened an HTML Email. When you click             on a link within an Email message, you will first pass through our             server, and then are redirected onto the Internet. We use this data             on an aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our Email messages             and to determine which links are most useful to our client base.
Within the Quicken Loans Family: Within the Quicken             Loans family, which includes our title company, Amrock,             we may exchange customer information to fulfill your requests or to             provide you with information about other products or services, if             you have chosen to receive such communications.
Service Providers: In some cases, we will employ or             use service providers such as title companies, appraisers,             consultants, and temporary workers, third party software developers,             to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf.             For example, we may use service providers to enhance our website             technology, deliver products, or to send Emails. When we employ service             providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information.             Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally             identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.
Service Alerts and Critical Notices: Although we respect             and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may need to             contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your             ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes,             such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to respond to your specific             requests, to clarify the order information you provided to us, or to             notify you of upcoming subscription expiration dates.
Change of Control: Your personally identifiable             information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer,             exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise)             of all or a portion of a business of Quicken Loans. You will have the             opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information             following any change of control.
Changes to Our Privacy Policy: If we plan to make             significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with             respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post             those changes to the Quicken Loans website 30 days before they take effect.
Legal Disclosures: In some cases we may disclose             certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court             order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.
WE WORK TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM LOSS, MISUSE,         OR UNAUTHORIZED ALTERATION.
We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the         personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from         loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. All data sent to Quicken Loans         is protected with technology that enables encryption of your data. We use:
Secure Socket Layer (SSL): The Quicken Loans             Web server supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) transaction             protocol originally developed by Netscape and now largely accepted             as an industry standard. The purpose of this encryption protocol             is to keep confidential the information passed back and forth             between a Web server and its users.
128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption: Quicken             Loans uses 128-Bit Domestic Grade Strong Encryption, a powerful             encryption commercially available for Internet products. (However,             be aware that if you are using a 40-bit browser, your encryption             level, while secure, is not the highest level available. United             States and Canadian citizens can download free 128-bit browsers             from Mozilla , Apple , or Microsoft .
We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on                 the site's servers from unauthorized access using industry standard                 computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully                 developed security procedures and practices. All employees must                 review and sign a written statement of these practices which include                 limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees                 who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols                 for all employees. In addition, a username, member ID name and                 password are required for you to use, view or change application                 or interview information. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.
WE TELL YOU HOW AND WHY WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGIES.
Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our websites:
Cookies: A "cookie" is a small piece of information                 that our website may provide to your browser while you are at our                 sites. The Quicken Loans website supplies your browser with cookies                 that contain a unique identifier used to better understand website                 usage in the aggregate and on an individual level so we know what                 areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of                 visits to those areas). This is done through a tracking utility                 that allows us, for example, to reconstruct activity from a                 session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution                 purposes. Quicken Loans may also employ service providers to                 help us collect and understand our website usage data.
When periodic surveys are presented to website visitors, cookies                 are used to prevent issuing multiple invitations to the same individual.
If you are a registered member on the Quicken Loans website,                 you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained                 by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is also                 used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access                 to areas of our website that are limited to registered members,                 such as those that allow you to view and manage your personal profile.
Additionally, Quicken Loans service providers that serve ads on                 affiliate and/or advertiser websites may assign different cookies                 and small graphical images called single-pixel GIFs or web beacons,                 to your browser to track the effectiveness of Quicken Loans                 advertising on other websites and your involvement with Quicken                 Loans. For example, as part of the Quicken Loans affiliate programs,                 our service providers use cookies and web beacons to determine                 when affiliate program members have referred a customer to Quicken                 Loans via a link on their website. The Quicken Loans website also                 sets a temporary cookie that contains a unique, anonymous identifier                 that is provided to the service provider to ensure that each referral                 is only counted once. This cookie is not linked to a customer's personal                 information. The cookies and web beacons are necessary to ensure                 that affiliate program members are appropriately credited for their                 referrals. Service providers report data in the aggregate and do                 not link it to individual customer information. Quicken Loans may                 also employ service providers who may assign cookies or web beacons                 to your browser to assist us in collecting website usage data such                 as your IP address, session ID, URL and demographic information                 such as your zip code. The collection of data may include personally                 identifiable information. We do not track URLs that you type into                 your browser, nor do we track you across the Internet once you leave our site.
If you simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from our site.                 Should you decide, however, that you would like to register and sign in to                 special areas of the website and you have modified your browser settings not                 to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser to accept the cookies                 that we send. Otherwise, you won't be able to participate in certain areas of                 the website. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.
If you wish to remove cookies provided by Quicken Loans, please check                 your browser's settings and Help section for instructions for removing                 cookies from your browser.
Behavioral Advertising: Please be aware that we use                 third party advertising companies to collect non-personally                 identifiable information for online behavioral advertising to provide                 targeted display advertisements, likely to be of greater interest                 to you, through participating publishers and advertisers. Such                 information may include non-personally identifiable information                 (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date,                 subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) through the                 use of Cookies and other technology.

Website Usage Data: Our website tracks usage data,             including, for example, your IP address, your browser type and version,             which pages you view, which page, if any, linked you to our site, and             which link, if any, you follow off of our site. We use this data in             the aggregate and on an individual level to better understand website             activity to improve our site offerings, to reconstruct activity from a             session or by a user, for troubleshooting and issue resolution purposes.             We may also use this data to provide you a more personalized website             experience, assistance with technical support questions, and to send             you special offers, product and service updates, or other promotional             materials that are relevant and tailored to your interests. If you do             not want to receive these offers or promotions, simply indicate your             contact preferences during the registration process, within any future             communications or by sending an Email to optout@QuickenLoans.com .             You may also click here to             change your contact preferences. We do not share your information with             outside companies for their promotional use. We do not track URLs             that you type into your browser, nor do we track you across the             Internet once you leave our site.

Your activity on third-party             websites is governed by the security and privacy policies of each             third-party website.
