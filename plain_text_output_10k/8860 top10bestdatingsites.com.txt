The section and sub-section headings used below are for convenience of reading only (and are not to be used for interpretive purposes), and we hope they ease navigating this Privacy Policy.
We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. In which case, we will post the modified Privacy Policy on the Site, and the “Last Updated” statement at the bottom shall reflect the effective date of the modified version. Any access or use you make of the Site following such date, constitutes your consent and acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.

Information You Provide to Us. Some of the Services will require you to provide or submit certain Personal Information in order to be able to use them.

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, such as a first and last name, an email address, phone number, a home or other physical address, and other contact information. In some jurisdictions and given the specific use we make with the information, IP address that your Internet service provider allocates for your device, may also be considered as Personal Information. In which case, we will be treating the information as personal in all handling and safeguarding aspects, however, we do not make any use of such information for user identification or personalization purposes.
Third Party Forms and Services: The Site lists, rates and compares various 3rd party businesses, brands and commercial entities (collectively, "Partners") and their respective products and/or services (collectively, "Products"). We may, from time to time, provide you with offers, services and Products of Partners via an online form to be filled by you, upon your choice and consent, and such information will be used to facilitate your connection and/or engagement with the relevant Partner (“Lead”). Additionally, if you want to receive more information about a Partner or a Product, or if you otherwise want to pursue a transaction with a Partner, and you click the relevant Partner icon or tab, you may be directed to a landing page or an online form that is owned and operated by the Partner (the "Landing Page"); similarly, you may also be directed to the Landing Page through other websites and online searches. In either case, however, you may be prompted to submit certain information on the Landing Page, including Personal Information such as your name, email address, and phone number (such information collectively, "Landing Page Info"). The Landing Page Info that you submit is collected directly by the Partner who provided it, and will include its own privacy policy and data collection practices information. We advise you to refer to such privacy policy to better understand the purpose of collection and use of the Personal Information you submit.
Contact Us. If you send us a ‘Contact Us’ (or similar) request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available, by sending an email to an email address that we display, by using a feedback or reporting feature that is available on the Site, or by other means, you may be required to provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address.
