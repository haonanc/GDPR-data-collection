Information We Collect and How We Collect It
In connection with your access to our Site and/or use of our Service, we collect and store certain information about you.

We call that information “personal information.” We collect personal information and other information as described below:

We collect your personal information when you or your employer registers to use the Service, provides information when using the Site or Service, updates your account information, adds additional services, submits information to verify your identity, contacts us with questions or feedback, or otherwise communicates with us. This personal information may include your name, address, email address, phone number, bank account information and taxpayer identification number.
When You Choose to Participate in Market Research Programs. We may collect information from you, including personal information, if you choose to participate in a market research program or survey.
Your Email or Social Network Contacts. We collect your email, social network and other contacts (“Contacts”) if you choose to share them with us, or you choose to refer potential customers to us via our referral programs (the “Referred Leads”).
Public Information. We may collect information about you from public sources, such as public social media pages.
Information from Third Parties. We may collect and receive information about you, including personal information and financial account information, from third parties, such as financial institutions and our service providers, for identity verification, fraud protection, risk assessment and other purposes.

We also automatically collect certain usage information through cookies and related technologies, as described below. In addition, our Site may implement third-party software, such as Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA (the “Invisible CAPTCHA”), that collects your information for security purposes.
Single Sign-On Information. Single Sign-On allows you to sign in to the Service from another service you use and with which we partner. We will collect certain information for security purposes in order to verify your authorized access to the Service, including your username and password for the other service.
