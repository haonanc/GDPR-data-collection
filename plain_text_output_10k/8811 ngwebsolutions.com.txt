Privacy Statement
This Privacy Statement applies to the website located at http://www.ngwebsolutions.com/ (the “Website”) which is owned and operated by NextGen Web Solutions, LLC (“Next Gen”).

Information Governed by this Privacy Statement
This Privacy Statement applies only to information collected through our Website, and it does not govern any information you may provide to us by phone or otherwise. “PII” means “personally identifiable information,” which is information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us (including without limitation you name, address, email address, telephone number, or other personal information). “Non-PII” means “non-personally identifiable information” or other information which alone does not identify you (however, in some circumstances it may be possible for Non-PII to be combined with PII in order to identify a specific individual). We sometimes refer to both PII and Non-PII in this Privacy Statement as “Information.”
Collection of Your Information

In order to request a demo, request information about our products and services, or otherwise contact us through our Website, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain PII such as your name, school or university name, company name, and email address.
