Conditions for Submissions of Articles for Peer-Reviewed Publication
13. Submission
If published, your article will in principle remain published permanently, with your personal details and those of your co-authors, as well as those of the reviewers and handling editors,     on the Frontiers website, and stored in archives, in repositories and potentially in other places.
When you submit an article to Frontiers, you promise that:
the article is not under consideration by any other journal; if it has been submitted for consideration elsewhere, it has been definitively rejected and is no longer being considered for publication
the article will not be submitted for publication elsewhere unless either published or rejected by Frontiers
you have the explicit consent of all co-authors to submit the article and to accept these conditions, including the granting of the CC-BY licence, on behalf of all co-authors
you have the authorisation of all copyright owners (which may include your employer or funder, and any owners of third-party graphics) to submit the article and to grant the CC-BY licence over the article
an article submitted to report original research is an original contribution, meaning it contains content that has not been previously published in its current form (except for manuscripts deposited as pre-prints in established community-validated pre-print services)
the article does not contain any non-attributed content from any existing source, including the authors’ own existing material
all contributors have been adequately acknowledged
the article and all authors meet the authorship criteria as outlined in the Author Guidelines
all findings have been verified in accordance with the highest scientific standards in the relevant field
all research involving regulated animals (i.e. all live vertebrates and higher invertebrates) has been conducted in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines, all applicable legislation and guidelines and accepted best practices, and the approval body has been identified in the article
research involving human subjects has been conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki , you have identified the approval body in the article and the article states clearly that informed written consent was obtained from all participants
the article clearly declares any financial, commercial or other relationships which may be considered to represent a potential conflict of interest
you have disclosed all relevant facts to Frontiers concerning the author(s), the article, the underlying research, any relevant third-party rights and any actual or potential conflicts of interest.
14. Acceptance and Rejection
Acceptance is at Frontiers’ discretion in accordance with its rules and processes.  Once accepted, an article will in principle be published; on rare occasions an issue causing rejection may arise or be discovered, in which case the article may be rejected despite having been previously accepted.
15. Publication
There is no prior right to publication.  Articles submitted will be subjected to ethical and technical checks and then to our rigorous and interactive peer-review process, which will require your cooperation.
If the article is published, you will become liable to pay our article publication charge (APC), or to ensure that it is paid.  Current APCs can be seen here .
The Frontiers peer-review process is designed to ensure scientific rigour and does not check for the satisfaction of the other requirements.
16. Disclosure of inventions
You must ensure that all patent applications have been filed prior to submission of your article.
17. Time for publication
If Frontiers unjustifiably fails to publish an article within a reasonable period of its final acceptance and payment by the author,     Frontiers shall refund the publication fee, to the exclusion of any other liability of Frontiers for such failure.
18. The Published Article
Once published, an article can not be removed except by Frontiers’ decision, taken in accordance with accepted retraction processes. The article is likely to be archived and referenced in a number of archives and repositories.
The article will be published with the name(s) and affiliation(s) of the author(s) and the names of the reviewers who endorsed publication during the peer review, as well as that of the handling editor.
Frontiers reserves the right to remove any content, and to retract peer-reviewed articles, which in its view breach any applicable terms of Frontiers and/or which in Frontiers’ view are inappropriate in any way.  Such removal does not entitle the author to reimbursement of APC.
Frontiers is not liable for the acts or statements of others.
19. Licences (Permissions) You Grant as an Author
When you submit an article to Frontiers, you grant to Frontiers and to the world at large a permanent, non-cancellable, free-of-charge, worldwide licence (permission) to publish,     display, store, copy and re-use that article – including any third-party materials – and to create derivative works from it.  You can not terminate that licence.     You must ensure that you have all necessary permissions from third parties. Ownership by the third party of the copyright can still be notified on the relevant materials,     and attribution must be made in accordance with usual scholarly practices.
The licence (permission) you grant over your article (including any third-party materials included in your article) is a Creative Commons attribution licence (known as a "CC-BY" licence). You can not terminate that licence.
In summary, the CC-BY licence means that anyone may copy, re-publish and/or re-use your content, and create derivative works from it, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, without charge, but must clearly attribute the work to you and any co-authors, and they must cite Frontiers as the original publisher of that content.     Complete information can be found here .
You agree that as the Creative Commons organisation updates the CC-BY licence, the licence terms granted by you are automatically updated to the new version.
Reproduction of all or part of an article is also subject to compliance with usual academic attribution practices, which must be scrupulously complied with in addition to the CC-BY requirements.
You may not reproduce or publish any content in any forum (online or not) which advocates any political, religious, anti-religious, racist, extremist, violent or disrespectful viewpoints.  If you post any Frontiers content in such a forum, you must remove it immediately on request by Frontiers.
You may also not reproduce any content from our websites in order to denigrate Frontiers.
The same CC-BY licence also applies to any other content, such as reviews, opinions, conference abstracts and blog posts, which you may submit to Frontiers.
You irrevocably grant us permission to use any non-patented ideas set out in your content or in any message sent or submitted to Frontiers, without any charge and without restriction, for any purpose in any part of the world.
Any content of yours appearing on a non-Frontiers website remains subject to the terms and conditions of that website.
20. Disputes
We have mediation processes for settling disputes related to articles, and we mutually promise to exhaust those possibilities prior to commencing any judicial dispute resolution mechanisms.
Advertising, Commercial Promotion and Sponsorships

If you encounter problems, please feel free to contact our technical support: support@frontiersin.org .
27. Availability. Viruses and Attacks. Bugs and Errors
Frontiers endeavours, through active maintenance, to ensure that its websites remain available, bug-free and error-free, but the need for planned and emergency maintenance and the nature of software development mean that no absolute guarantee can be given.

You are strongly advised to keep back-ups of any content which you do not wish to lose.
Frontiers adopts industry-standard measures to minimise the risk of attacks, viruses, other harmful code and hackers.  Given that our platform exists to permit the contribution of content, and given the constant efforts of those with ill intent, we can not guarantee that the website, or links posted by users, will be free from third-party viruses and other malicious third-party software or that we will always be successful in preventing attacks from succeeding.  We will continue in our efforts both to prevent such occurrences and to minimise their impact on us and on our users.

Privacy Policy

This also ensures we are in line with the latest laws on data protection.
This Privacy Policy comes into effect on 25th May, 2018.
Why do we collect personal data?
Frontiers has a mission – to make scientific and scholarly research open to all, as more than ever, science and technology are needed to engineer solutions to move us towards a sustainable society.  To do this we seek to engage with the world’s research community and to serve each researcher as best we can.  Being able to understand your research interests, speciality and publications helps us in this task.
Our goal with this policy is to be as clear as possible. If you have any questions you are welcome to contact us at data.controller@frontiersin.org .
What personal data do we collect, and when do we collect it?
1. We collect data which you provide or authorise us to receive from third parties
Frontiers and its open research network, Loop, have one single registered user base and a unified registration.
When you register with Frontiers or Loop, you provide us with certain information, which becomes part of your registered user profile with Frontiers. Some basic information is required for registration, and you may choose to provide additional personal information. We also ask you if you wish to link other, publicly-available, information about your professional activities – including articles published, awards received etc – to your profile.
When registering, and any time after registration, you choose how much information you wish to provide, based on the privacy options available on the registration page and on your profile once registered.
If you, as a registered user, undertake an activity with Frontiers, such as submitting, co-authoring or reviewing an article, or becoming an editor, your contributions will be linked to your user profile. This approach maximises impact for your professional achievements and credits you for your contributions.
You may register with Frontiers via your Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter profile.  We will store the name, profile picture and email address from that external profile.  We do not ask that external party for any more information and we do not provide any information to the external party as part of that process. The external party will know that you are registering with Frontiers.
You may respond to a promotion on another website by contacting us and expressing an interest in receiving communications or participating in a Frontiers initiative in your area of interest or expertise. We will retain the personal information you provide to us for this purpose.
You can, if you wish, link your ORCiD profile with your Frontiers account. If you choose to do this we will add your ORCiD and your ORCiD-listed publications to your Frontiers profile.
We may provide other linking services in the future to provide a better service to you.
2. We collect information when you visit our websites
When you visit any page on the Frontiers websites, some technical information is automatically collected:
Geo-location data. We record (via IP addresses and time stamp) from where in the world you are accessing the article, research topic and profile pages on our websites.

Log data. We record information, known as log data, including browser interaction data and other information that your device’s browser automatically sends to any website you visit. This log data includes your IP address, which browser you are using and its settings, the date and time of your request, and data on how you used our website, "cookie" data (we explain this below) and information about your device.
Device information. We collect information on the type of device you are using, its operating system, browser type and version and other information to enable us to ensure that our website operates properly with your device.  This may include information unique to your device.  The information your device sends to us depends on its manufacturer.

Frontiers collects publicly-available information and information from subscription services on researchers, both registered and non-registered.  Only information relevant to professional research activities is collected, such as name, institutional affiliation, contact details, publications, academic activities and specialisation(s), editorships and awards.
This enables us to provide researchers with high-quality publishing services, such as  identifying the most suited expert reviewers for articles or building world-class editorial boards.

This includes having standard clauses approved by the European Commission and the Swiss data protection authority in our contracts with parties that receive information outside the EEA. We also rely on European Commission and Swiss government adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, for data transfers to countries outside the EEA; this may include reliance on the EU-US privacy shield .

When we publish an article of which you are an author, editor or reviewer, your name is published with the article. This is part of the Frontiers mission to improve peer-review through transparency and accountability, and to credit and acknowledge your contribution.  Anyone can see your name in connection with that article.  Your name and association with that article cannot be removed or deleted unless required by accepted scholarly publishing practice.
We use subcontractors, with appropriate data protection measures, to perform some of our processes.  These include typesetting and copy-editing of articles, and customer relationship management.
We work with numerous public research repositories, scholarly databases and other organisations (such as CLOCKSS, Crossref, DOAB (Directory of Open-Access Books), DOAJ (Directory of Open-Access Journals), MedLine, OpenAire, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus and Web of Science and other reputable scholarly repositories), to archive research articles and/or their metadata,  as well as  databases to enable plagiarism checks such as iThenticate, which provides additional discoverability and a further guarantee of a permanent record of those articles; or to enable plagiarism checks to be handled efficiently.  With some repositories only the metadata is provided, which includes information identifying the authors and reviewers of an article.  You can find further information on third parties we work with here .
Use of tracking and custom audience methods, described elsewhere in this privacy policy, involve sharing of information as described in those sections.
We may be required to share information with law enforcement agencies.
