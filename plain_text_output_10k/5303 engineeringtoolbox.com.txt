PowerInbox Privacy Policy
We (PowerInbox Inc. and/or PowerInbox Ltd. (collectively, “POWERINBOX”)) know that you care about how your information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.
This POWERINBOX Privacy Policy covers our treatment of Personal Information (i.e., information which can be used to identify you), as well as other information we gather when you access any of our websites, including, but not limited to   https://powerinbox.com/ , http://rs-stripe.com/ , and https://www.chameleos.com/ (collectively, the “Site”) or interact with our services, including AdServer for Email, RevenueStripe, InboxEngage, InboxChoice, and Advertiser Network (collectively, the Site and these services are the “Services”). We outline below the information collected by POWERINBOX through its Services, the purpose for collecting such information, who we share the information with, and choices that you may have with regard to your Personal Information.
The ways we use and share your information, including Personal Information, may vary depending on whether you are (i) a visitor to our Site (“Site Visitor”); (ii) a POWERINBOX customer (i.e., publisher, advertiser, or other content provider) (“Customer”); or (iii) recipients of emails from Customers (“Consumers”). We have therefore distinguished the information that relates to each of these types of individuals into three different sections below. Information that is relevant to all of these three categories is set forth in Section 1 of this Privacy Policy. Depending on how you interact with our Services, you may be part of more than one category (e.g., if you are a Customer who has also visited our Site, then Sections 1, 2, and 3 will apply to you).
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, we define “Personal Information” as personally identifiable information about an individual, such as a name and email address.
By visiting our Site, or by interacting with any of our Services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
GENERAL INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO SITE VISITORS, CUSTOMERS, AND CONSUMERS
As described in Sections 2-4 below, the information that we collect about you depends on whether you are a Site Visitor, Customer, or Consumer. We may also use or share your information in different ways. Regardless of whether you are a Site Visitor, Customer, or Consumer, however, we will use and share your information as follows:
HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
Provide Our Services. We may use your information to provide and improve our Services and to develop new Services. For instance, if you are a Consumer we might process information about your broad geographic location in order to provide you with localized email content on behalf of our Customers, who incorporate our Services into their emails.  We might also track your interaction with an advertisement that we serve on behalf of one of our Customers in an email.
Data Analytics. We may use your information to analyze use of our Services and understand how individuals engage with our Services. We do so at an aggregate level, in order to analyze general trends.
We may use your information to respond to your inquiries, fulfill your requests, complete your transactions, and for other service or support purposes.

Legal Compliance. We may use your information in order to comply with the law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or other legal process, or as part of an investigation or request from law enforcement or a government official.
In relation to Consumers, we convert email addresses into a random unique ID number, which we use in order to provide our Services to Customers over time (e.g., serving advertisements). Except for a limited period of time in server logs, we endeavor not to retain Consumer email addresses.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
Service Providers.We may share your information with our vendors, service providers, agents, or others who perform functions on our behalf.
We may share your information with any current or future affiliates, parent companies, or subsidiaries.
We may share your information to comply with the law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or other legal process, or as part of an investigation or request from law enforcement or a government official or regulatory body.

Protection of POWERINBOX and Others. We may share your information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy and/or any other agreements between you and POWERINBOX, including investigation of potential violations thereof; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of POWERINBOX, its visitors, users, and/or the public.

Any access to and use of such linked websites, applications, or third-party services is not governed by this Privacy Policy but instead is governed by the privacy statements of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements.
SECURITY
We endeavor to take security measures to guard against unauthorized access to the systems where we store your information. This includes internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures and physical security measures. However, despite the measures we take, we cannot warrant the security of any information provided to us. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of your information at any time.
DATA RETENTION
We will retain your information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and as outlined in this Privacy Policy.  When determining how long to retain your data, we consider: (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you as a Customer or, if you are a Consumer, what is reasonable and legitimate in the context of providing our Services (noting that we may retain de-identified information about your behavior in response to advertisements across successive Customer campaigns); (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; and (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our interests (e.g., to enforce any agreements between you and POWERINBOX or in light of regulator recommendations or industry best practices).

Please note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process opt-out requests. Site Visitors and Customers who opt out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest them may still receive emails about their account or any Services they have requested or received from us.
If you are a Consumer, you should contact the Customer with whom you interact (i.e., the organization sending you emails that incorporate our technologies) in order to exercise any rights you might have to stop receiving those emails.
Users in certain countries have a right to communicate with their local supervisory authority / data protection regulator about our use of Personal Information.
