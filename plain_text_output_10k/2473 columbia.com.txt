This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Columbia Sportswear Company and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies, including Mountain Hardwear and Sorel ("Columbia" or "We"). Unless we otherwise indicate, this Policy applies to all personal information collected by Columbia from any source, including information collected through our online services and activities, including this Website and our mobile applications (collectively, "Sites"), and at retail locations. This Policy will not apply where we display or link to a different privacy policy.
PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED
We collect information from you in various ways. We collect personal information you directly provide to us through our Sites, in our stores and through your other interactions with us. For example, we may collect your name, email address, postal address, phone number, fax number, photographs, videos, demographics and other information you provide or allow us to collect from you. We also collect credit card numbers if you purchase our products and services. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect from you.
When you visit our Sites, some information is automatically collected. For example, we may collect your computer's operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. If you access our Sites from a mobile device, we may also collect information about the type of mobile device you use, your device's unique ID, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use and information about the location of your device (for information about how to opt-out of location information collection, please see "Your Information Choices and Changes" below). We also collect information about your usage of and activity on our Sites.
Cookies. We may automatically collect information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Sites and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our Sites. Many Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies from our Sites. If you set your browser not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, it may affect certain features or services of our Sites.
Web Beacons. We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons, or "gifs," are electronic images that may be used on our Sites or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. If you do not wish for us to track emails we send you, some email services may allow you to adjust your display to turn off HTML or images which may disable tracking, or you may unsubscribe from our marketing emails as described below.
While we and others give you choices described in this Policy, there are many ways Web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of or honor every mechanism.
THIRD PARTY COOKIES AND ADS
Third parties may also collect information about you through our Sites. For example, third party analytics services use cookies and web beacons to help us compile statistics about our Sites and visitors to our Sites. We receive assurances from those third party analytics services that they will not collect or access any information that directly identifies you on our Sites. Other third parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit our Site, for example, to display Columbia ads to you on third party websites and to deliver third party ads to our Sites and others as described below.
Columbia Ads on Third Party Websites
