Privacy Policy
At Someecards we believe information privacy is an important issue. Therefore, we have developed the following policy. This policy may be updated, revised and re-posted from time to time. This policy applies to all visitors to Someecards.com. By visiting Someecards, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Someecards in connection therewith (collectively, the "Site"), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
WE COLLECT INFORMATION, BUT WE RESPECT INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY
We collect certain personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") to facilitate card sends, card pickups, and the personalization of our Site. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, fulfilling orders for Someecards merchandise, targeting advertisements to you, and communicating with you about our products and services, including specials and new features. The types of Personal Information we may collect include:
E-mail Addresses:
We do not use the e-mail address contained in an E-Card for direct marketing purposes nor do we compile e-mail addresses to build mailing lists to sell to or share with marketers. We do use these addresses to facilitate card delivery and to assist in card pickups. E-mail addresses are also used help protect a recipient's privacy right to know the identity of a card sender. We also have an e-mail newsletter and periodically send e-mails to our subscribers. When you receive e-mail or our newsletter from Someecards, you can opt out of receiving further communications by following the included instructions to unsubscribe.
IP addresses and Information Shared with Card Recipients:
Someecards is not intended as to be used as an anonymous mail service. Card senders share with card recipients certain information beyond the notes they include with their cards, including e-mail addresses and IP addresses. IP ADDRESSES OF CARD SENDERS ARE INCLUDED IN THE E-MAIL MESSAGE HEADER OF ALL CARDS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CARD RECIPIENTS AND TO PROTECT CARD RECIPIENTS FROM ANONYMOUS ABUSE OR HARASSMENT. Under certain circumstances, recipients, their legal representatives, and/ or law enforcement authorities may be able to combine this with information disclosed by ISPs to determine the source of a particular communication. By using the Site, you knowingly and voluntarily assume any risks associated with such disclosure. This is necessary to facilitate card delivery and to protect the privacy of card recipients.
Summary Demographics:
Demographic and profile data is also collected at our Site. We use this data to tailor a visitor's experience at our Site -- displaying content that might interest visitors, and displaying content according to visitor preferences. Generally, our Site automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Someecards only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Site so that we can make the Site appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve our services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Site or services. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use the Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Someecards never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

Ads appearing on the Site may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
