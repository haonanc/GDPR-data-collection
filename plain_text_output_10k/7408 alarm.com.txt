Alarm.com's Privacy Policy
Our Privacy MissionWe are sensitive to the private nature of the information you, our service providers, partners, end-users and prospective end-user customers provide to us. Our Privacy Policy is designed to maximize your ability to protect your personal, private data while at the same time allowing us to provide you with the best interactive security, energy management, video monitoring, automation and wellness services possible. This Privacy Policy states our privacy practices for your use of (i) this website and any mobile sites or applications operated by Alarm.com (the “User Interfaces”) and (ii) any combination of products and services we provide or that can be purchased or accessed via any User Interface (the “Services”). Alarm.com’s Services are provided by licensed and authorized service providers (referred to as “Authorized Service Providers” or “Alarm.com Dealers”). If you are a customer of an Authorized Service Provider, your information will be processed by Alarm.com acting as a data processor and your Authorized Service Provider will remain responsible for the handling of any personal information it collects from you and for compliance with any applicable data protection and/or privacy laws. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully.For Data Subjects in the European Economic Area ("EEA") and SwitzerlandIf you are located in the EEA or Switzerland, our "Privacy Notice to Data Subjects in the EEA and Switzerland" provides additional information about your use of the User Interfaces and Services and your rights as data subjects residing in Switzerland or the EEA, which includes all countries in the European Union, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Information Collection and UseAlarm.com collects and stores certain information from or about you that can be used to uniquely contact, identify, or locate you ("Personal Information"). When using the User Interfaces, you may provide us with Personal Information including, but not limited to, your name, home or business address, phone number, email address, location, or zip code. When using our Services, you or your Authorized Service Provider may provide us with certain additional information (e.g., unit description, home or business size, home or business system configuration, sensor names, appliances or other devices monitored by Alarm.com, account information, schedule, mode, automation settings, and device settings) in order for us to personalize your Services. Alarm.com may also receive Personal Information that you have provided to our partners, including emergency contact information and user profile information, to enable Alarm.com to provide our Services. Alarm.com may process information regarding your use of the Alarm.com Services, including but not limited to: performance of any security or other device monitored by Alarm.com, electrical usage or consumption, heating and cooling information, light or other fixture settings, and usage and alert logs. We receive this type of information from your devices that are monitored by Alarm.com and your computer or other electronic device through which you may access, browse, download, receive, or otherwise use the Alarm.com User Interfaces or Services (each a "Personal Device"), and we may also receive and process such information from third parties.Location-based InformationSome features of our Services, such as location-activated arming reminders, thermostat adjustments, vehicle diagnostics, and other location-based Services (collectively, “GeoServices”), use location information. Before certain GeoServices information can be used, you must first opt-in to activate these Services. If you enable these features, we will automatically collect and store location information from your Personal Device or vehicle you designate which is capable of producing location data (e.g., mobile device, GPS device, or vehicle). This location information may include your current location or places you have recently visited. We also may aggregate this information for Alarm.com's internal purposes and to provide information requested by you.

This may include capturing and sending you portions of this data as part of a notification or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. We may process information from your monitoring equipment so that we can send you alerts. In addition, if you have the recording features enabled, we will capture, process and store video and audio data recordings from your device and you may be able to access those recordings. Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of security cameras, connected doorbells and other devices with recording capabilities. You (not Alarm.com) are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home or business that they may be recorded using security cameras and other devices with recording capabilities. Alarm.com takes no responsibility for your compliance with these laws.Information SharingAlarm.com will not disclose your Personal Information to any other entity except:
