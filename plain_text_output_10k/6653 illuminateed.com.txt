I. Your Privacy Rights Are Important To Us
The privacy of students, their parents and guardians, and visitors of this website is important to Illuminate Education, Inc. (“Illuminate”). This Privacy Policy is intended to answer your questions about the privacy practices applicable to our Website, www.illuminateed.com , as well as the data Illuminate maintains on behalf of teachers, administrators, school districts, counties, and other educational institutions (“Educational Organizations”) throughout the country.
Illuminate partners with Educational Organizations to provide tools to collect, organize, and analyze data about the students and education professionals in their school, charter management organization, county and/or district. Educational Organizations collect information about students and their guardians, teachers, and other individuals which is then stored and processed by Illuminate. In these situations, the Educational Organization rather than Illuminate decides the reasons information will be collected and processed. Illuminate’s privacy and data security practices regarding such information are governed by the contract entered into between Illuminate and the Education Organization and applicable law. For details regarding the information your Educational Organization collects, the use of such information, and any permissible disclosures to third-parties, please contact your Educational Organization directly. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies that Illuminate does not own or control, or individuals who Illuminate does not manage.
 
Information Collected from Our Website
Although you can visit our Website without telling us who you are, when you access our Website, our servers automatically gather information from your browser, such as your IP Address. Your IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer or device by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Collecting IP addresses is a standard practice and is generally done automatically. Our servers may also track additional information, including but not limited to the pages of our Website that you visit or the services you use, the browser you are using, the operating system of your computer or mobile device, and the way you interact with our services.
Illuminate may, from time to time, use a third-party service, such as Google Analytics, to collect and analyze this type of visitor data. We use this information for a number of purposes, including calculating usage levels, diagnosing server issues, improving our Website and services to better accommodate user patterns, and detecting and diminishing security threats.
Cookies and Web Beacons
We also use other automated collection tools, such as “cookies” and “web beacons”, to gather information from you and your computer while you are visiting our Website. A cookie is a small file stored on your computer that lets us know whether you’ve visited our Website or accessed our services before as well as your navigation experience during your visit. Our cookies do not contain or capture personal information. We use cookies to facilitate your access to our services, to enhance your experience, to increase security, and to recognize your computer or device. Cookies allow us to collect statistical information about the usage of our services and Website to improve functionality and design. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust your browser’s settings to decline cookies or otherwise modify your browser’s interactions with cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, it is possible that some of our services’ features may not function properly.
Email Marketing
Email marketing sent by Illuminate may contain web beacons and other similar technologies to track the response rate to such communications. Web beacons (also known as pixel gifs, pixel tags, clear gifs, third-party pixels, or targeting pixels) are small graphics with a unique piece of identifying code, similar to a cookie, used to track the online movements of a web user or to access previously set cookies. These tools are used in email communications to determine whether messages have been opened or otherwise acted upon.

Our services and Website do not respond to your browser’s “do-not-track” signals or comparable mechanisms.

Student and Teacher Information
Your Educational Organization uses Illuminate’s services to assist with the administration of school-related activities and to provide a streamlined way to collect, organize, access, and report your information for educational purposes. These uses are specific to each Educational Organization and are governed by the contract between Illuminate and your Educational Organization.
The data your Educational Organization stores on Illuminate’s systems may include the following information about students and their guardians:
Demographic information including name, mailing address, email address, and date of birth;
Student education records including your student’s grades, class enrollment, and behavioral records;
Health-related information including your student’s immunizations and vision and hearing screening results;

In addition to student/guardian information, Illuminate also stores data provided by Educational Organizations related to teachers and other school employees, such as:
Demographic information including the individual’s name, address, email address, and date of birth;
The individual’s ethnicity;
Information about the individual’s employment with the Educational Organization;
System usernames and passwords.
Your Educational Institution determines the information collected, maintained, and processed using Illuminate’s services. If you have any questions regarding the collection, storage, and use of the information your Educational Institution shares with Illuminate, please contact your Educational Institution directly.
Disclosure to Third Parties
 
Illuminate only shares information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We never sell student records or other user information to third parties. Illuminate stores such information in locations outside its facilities, such as on servers co-located with third-party hosting providers or with secure cloud-storage services.
As we grow, we may buy or sell assets or business divisions. Generally, the information stored on our systems would be transferred in such a transaction. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of business combinations, including but not limited to mergers, divestitures, or dissolution. In the event of such a transaction, any successor entity that acquires your information will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
Review or Deletion of Records Maintained by Illuminate
Parents, legal guardians, or students who have reached 18 years of age may review the student’s education records and correct erroneous information. To review or update your information to ensure its accuracy or to correct any errors and omissions, please contact your Educational Organization directly.
 
IV. How We Protect Your Information
Whether collected directly from our Website or maintained on behalf of your Educational Organization, protecting the privacy of your information is important to us. We take security measures—physical, electronic, and procedural—to help defend against the unauthorized access and disclosure of your information. In addition to the restrictions discussed in this Privacy Policy, our employees are required to comply with information security safeguards, and our systems are protected by technological measures to help prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access.. The specific measures Illuminate takes to secure your information are defined by the contract between Illuminate and your Educational Organization. These measures meet or exceed the requirements of applicable federal and state law. Illuminate’s employees are trained to observe and comply with applicable federal and state privacy laws in the handling, processing, and storage of your information.
Despite these precautions, no system can be completely secure and there remains a risk that unauthorized access or use, hardware or software failure, human error, or a number of other factors may compromise the security of your information.
