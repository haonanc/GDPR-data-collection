Some web site policies claim their online privacy policy only covers online contacts. This makes no sense and is a red flag that there is no coordinated privacy program, a policy was copied without much thought, or the site is attempting to use a legal loophole.  Would it make sense to have separate privacy policies for telephone communications, regular mail, or face-to-face contacts?  A coordinated privacy program would have one policy covering the collection and use of information no matter what the medium.
Many companies, such as Microsoft and Cisco, actually maintain different privacy policies for different web sites.  They claim to government officials that they have comprehensive corporate privacy programs monitored by TRUSTe. However, when an inquiry is made Microsoft and Cisco both claim that some of their data collection at sites with different privacy policies not covered by TRUSTe.  Microsoft, Cisco and TRUSTe have all claimed that the posted privacy policies are not enforceable by web site visitors under contract law because visiting a web site does not constitute a contract!  Both Microsoft and Cisco are compiling IP address “blacklists” and/or “reputation scores” of accused spammers.  There have been many false alarms Microsoft or Cisco often will not tell people or small businesses why they were put on the list.  Many have complained that the responses have been arrogant and accusatory and there is no recourse through the TRUSTe system because the date is collected at non-TRUSTe sites or TRUSTe says the situation does not apply.  ( Microsoft’s reputation system | Cisco’s reputation system ). In these cases the online privacy policy, and the associated TRUSTe seals, are worthless.  The purpose is to give a false sense of security and deceive people into thinking they have control over the information collected about them.
