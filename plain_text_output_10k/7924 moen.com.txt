The program has a set of seven principles, to which Moen complies with respect to the data collected and used as described in this Privacy Policy. As part of that program, while we strive to respond to your concerns, we recognize that we may not always answer all of your questions, and as such if you are an EU resident, we will participate with the Data Protection Authority in the country in which you reside.
