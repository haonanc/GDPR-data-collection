INFORMATION WE COLLECT/RECEIVE
In the course of operating the Website, Med Help will collect (and/or receive) the following types of information. You authorize Us to collect and/or receive such information.
Personal Information
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” is information that (i) You voluntarily provide to Us or is obtained by Us through Your Use of the Website, and (ii) that personally identifies You. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, Your name, email or other address, fax number, mailing address, business address, phone number, date of birth, zip code, IP address, demographics, health information and other data that can be used to personally identify or contact You. In the course of using Our Products and Services, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify You and administer Your use and enjoyment of Our Products and Services. For example, when provided, We collect Personal Information like Your email address, date of birth and zip code when You register as a member of My Med Help or update Your member profile (“Registration Information”).
If You choose to use certain features, tools and services available in My Med Help to manage Your health information, We will collect health information that You enter into those My Med Help features, tools and services. If You choose to use Our Invite a Friend, Email This, or Share This service to tell a friend, family member or health care provider ("HCP") about Our Website, We will ask You for Your name, Your email address and Your friend’s, family member’s or HCP’s email address.
If You decide to post information in Public Areas, Your Personal Information may also contain sensitive personal information, including any confidential health information (if You choose to provide it) that You voluntarily provide.
From time to time, Med Help may communicate with You through postal mail, email, fax, telephone, or other forms of electronic communications regarding Your Account, inquiries You may make to Med Help customer service, the Products and Services and new Products and Services. If You respond to these communications, Your responses may also contain Personal Information.
You can decline to provide Your Personal Information to Us by not engaging in the activities described above, such as by not registering or creating an Account on the Website or by not using the Products and Services. If You decline to submit Personal Information, Med Help may not be able to or may choose not to provide to You some or all of its Products and Services. Accordingly, You can determine to a large extent what Personal Information You wish to provide to Us.
Other Information
In addition to the Personal Information, We may collect and/or receive additional Information (collectively, the “Other Information”). Such Other Information may include information:
From Your Activity. Med Help also collects non-personally identifiable server-log information relating to its Users. This information may include, but is not limited to, (i) Your Account activity, including storage usage, number of log-ins, data displayed or selected, including user interface elements, links, etc, and (ii) Your web request, Internet Protocol address (“IP address”), the location of Your computer (through the IP address), browser type, browser language, browser programming language, computer or mobile device type, the date and time of Your request, date and time of access, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify Your browser and referrer Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”). None of this information alone enables Med Help to personally identify or contact You.
From Cookies. When You visit the Website, We send to Your computer and/or Your mobile device (such as a smartphone), one or more cookies, which are small files containing a string of characters. A cookie, among other things, uniquely identifies Your browser and allows Med Help to “remember” Your device and/or Your activities on the Website. No Personal Information is collected or stored in these cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of the Products and Services. The information collected by cookies (a) helps Us dynamically generate advertising and content on web pages or in newsletters, (b) allows Us to statistically monitor how many people are using Our Website and selected sponsors’ and advertisers’ sites, (c) determine how many people open Our emails, and (d) for what purposes these actions are being taken. Cookies are also used to facilitate a User’s log-in, as navigation aids and as session timers. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when You close Your browser. Most web browsers have options that allow You to control whether or not to accept cookies. However, disabling cookies in Your browser may prevent access to some parts of Our Products and Services.
From Clear Gifs (Web Beacons). We may use "clear gifs," also known as "web beacons," which are small graphic files that allow Us to monitor the use of Our Website. A clear gif is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or when emails are opened or accessed, and is often used in combination with cookies. A clear gif can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears, the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears, the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed, the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server.
Social Media Widgets. The Products and Services may include social media features, such as widgets. These features may collect Your IP address, which page You are visiting on that website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Products and Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing it. To view the privacy policies of any company providing a social media feature, please visit that company’s website.

We may be a contractor to provide co-branded or privately labeled content and services to channel partner websites hosted and operated by companies other than Us. You can access these co-branded or privately labeled content and services only through the channel partner or private label partner website.

THIRD PARTY SITES
This Privacy Policy applies only to information We collect at and through the Products and Services. The use of cookies by Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by Our Privacy Policy. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for You to navigate Our Website. We do not have access to or control over these cookies. Some of Our affiliated companies administer sites, such as http://www.vitals.com/ which may be governed by their own separate privacy policies. Med Help permits third-party advertising companies and networks to place paid advertisements that may be visible when You visit, use and/or access the Website. These companies and networks include, among others, third party ad servers, ad agencies, advertising networks, advertising technology vendors, and research firms. Certain features of Our Products and Services also contain links to other websites and online services. If You choose to visit one of these websites, a third party service or an advertiser by clicking a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, You will be directed to that third party’s website or online service. The fact that We provide a link to a website’s content or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of Our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. This Privacy Policy is not applicable to the websites or content of any such third parties. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. We are not responsible for any use of Your information, including Your Personal Information, when You use or visit such third party websites, mobile applications and services.
Our third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers and sponsors on the Products and Services, may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies (and, in the case of cookies, access them on Your computer if You choose to have cookies enabled in Your browser) to serve You advertisements tailored to interests You have shown by browsing on this and other sites You have visited, to determine whether You have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending You duplicated advertisements. In doing so, the third party ad network provider collects non-personal data such as Your browser type, Your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed and other clickstream data. The use of third party cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these third party ad network providers is governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not by Med Help. Please visit http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/ to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad networks We may use. The Website does not have access to, nor control over, advertisers’ or ad service providers’ cookies or how they may be used or how they were collected. Other websites or services may follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information You submit to them. We strongly encourage You to read the Privacy Policies or statements of any such third party websites and services that You may use. If You would like more information about this practice and to know Your choices about not having this information used to target ads to You, please visit the websites referenced below. In addition, You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in Your browser or downloading a cookie management app such as Privacy Badger.
Med Help makes an effort to make it obvious to You when You leave Our Website and enter a third party website by requiring You to click on a link. In addition, if You see a phrase such as "Powered by" or "in association with" followed by the name of a company other than Med Help, then You are on a website hosted by a company other than Med Help.
You have options and choices about the collection and use of information by third-parties on Our site:

You can change these notification and reminder settings while updating Your profile or within the individual service itself (for example, Trackers).

The Products and Services feature interactive tools, journals, personal pages, message boards and other public forums where Users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another or where Users can post questions for others to answer. Any information shared (including Personal Information such as health information) that You reveal in a journal, personal page, message board or online discussion is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure service. Some features, such as Journals, Photos, and Personal Pages allow You to set the privacy setting for each item You create. For such features, You can set the privacy setting to Private, Public, or Friends Only. Public information can be seen by everybody without limitation. Viewers do not have to be members of Med Help in order to view this data. Friends Only information can be viewed by other Med Help members that You have elected to add as a friend. Private information can only be seen when logged in under Your user name or by Med Help administrators. You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information in any public forum. What You have written may be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways We are unable to control or predict; including to contact You for unauthorized purposes. As with any public forum on any site, this information may also appear in third-party search engines like Google, Yahoo and MSN. Med Help does not control the information indexed and cached by search engines. At Your request, Med Help can remove Personal Information from the Med Help site, but cannot remove this information from search engines.
