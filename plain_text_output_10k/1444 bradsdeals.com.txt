What Are Cookies? Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site.

Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages.

Web server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity.
