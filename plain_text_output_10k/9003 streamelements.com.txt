StreamElements Privacy Policy
This is the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) that governs how we, StreamElements (“StreamElements”, “we”, “our” or “us”),           use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the           use of: (i) the website streamelements.com, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains,           content and services, a “Site”); and (ii) the StreamElements mobile software application, and any other mobile software           application, that we license (each individually, and collectively, the “App”). The Site and the App are individually           and collectively referred to herein as the “Services”. We do not ourselves host any of the Services – all hosting is           done by third party service providers that we engage. This means that data you provide us or that we collect from you           (including any Personal Information, as defined below) – as further described in this Privacy Policy – is hosted with           such third party service providers on servers that they own or control. Regardless of where such third party service           providers are located (and some are located in the US), their servers may be located anywhere in the world (including           the US). Your data may even be replicated across multiple servers located in multiple countries. So please be aware that           you are consenting to your data being transferred to various third party service providers around the world (including           the US).
Introduction. We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important             to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your             Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services. “Personal Information” means any information             that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including,             but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address,             or other contact information.
Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use which is available at [please insert URL] (“Terms”). Any             capitalized but undefined term in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning given to it in the Terms.
Consent and Modification. You are not legally obligated to provide us Personal Information, and you hereby confirm that providing             us Personal Information is at your own free will. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy             and to our collection, processing and sharing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do             not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Services. We reserve the right, at our             discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting             of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Services thereafter means that you accept             those changes.
What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It. We do not currently require you to provide Personal Information             in order to have access to general information available on the Site. But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information             from you in the following ways:
Account. In order to use certain services that we offer via the Site and/or App, you may be required to create an account                 (“Account”). We may offer different options to create an Account, including: (a) Online Registration Form: You                 may choose to complete and submit an online registration form. You will be asked to provide us with certain mandatory                 information such as your name and email address, and also a password that you will use for your Account. (b) Third                 Party Accounts: You may choose to create an Account by clicking on a ‘connect’ or ‘sign-in’ button that we may                 display on the Site or App for a designated third party website or service (each a “Third Party Account”), such                 as Facebook, Youtube or twitch. Doing so will enable you to link your Service Account and your Third Party Account.                 If you choose this option, then you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information                 (which may include Personal Information) that we will obtain from your Third Party Account and the types of activities                 that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option,                 you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.
‘Contact Us’ Information. If you send us a “Contact Us” request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available                 or by sending an email to an email address that we display, you may be required to provide us with certain information                 such as your name and email address.
Share with Friends Service. The Site and/or App may enable you to invite your friends to use our Services by sending                 them an invitation email or message. You may do so by: [(i) using the Site and/or App to send or post an invitation                 message via your Third Party Account; and/or (ii) using the Site and/or App to send an invitation email to your                 friend’s external email address (for example, a gmail address).] If you send or post an invitation message we may                 collect Personal Information about the recipient such as their email address or their party website account user                 name and id.
Location Data. We may provide certain location-based services (“Location Services”) in connection with the App that                 are dependent on data related to the geographic location of your mobile device on which the App is installed (“Location                 Data”). If you choose to participate in these Location Services, you agree that we may collect or obtain your Location                 Data. You should be able to use the settings on your mobile device to turn off location-sharing features.
Log Files. We may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,                 type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any                 other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the Services,                 track users’ movement around the Services, and gather demographic information.
ookies and Other Tracking Technologies. Our Services may utilize “cookies”, anonymous identifiers and other tracking                 technologies in order to for us to provide our Services and present you with information that is customized for                 you. A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about activity on the                 Services. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address,                 previously indicated by a user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept                 them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose                 to block cookies with your browser.
Mobile Device Data. We may collect limited information from your mobile device in order to provide the App. Such information                 may include your mobile device type, mobile device id, and date and time stamps of App use. In addition, we may                 deploy tracking technologies within the App to help us gather aggregate statistics, but we will not use Personal                 Information for such purposes.
Google Analytics. The Site may use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of the Service.                 Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Service, what pages they visit when they                 do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Service. We use the information we get from Google                 Analytics to maintain and improve the Service and our products. We do not combine the information collected through                 the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Google’s ability to use and share information                 collected by Google Analytics about your visits to and use of the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics                 Terms of Service, available at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html, and the Google Privacy Policy, available                 at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You may learn more about how Google collects and processes data specifically                 in connection with Google Analytics at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You may prevent your data                 from being used by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on,                 available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.
Publicly Available Information. Any content that you post on or via the Services (“User Submissions”) may be publicly available             to other users of the Services, and may also be accessed and used by people off the Services. The notices and tools             that we provide on the Services are intended to inform you which information will be made publicly available. If you             publish your contact information in any User Submissions, you may receive unsolicited messages from other users of             the Services or the public. We, therefore, encourage you only to post information that you are sure you want to be             accessible to anyone.
The Way We Use Personal Information. If you submit or we collect Personal Information through the Services, then we may use             such Personal Information in the following ways, via any applicable communication channel, including e-mail, SMS, etc.:
We will use your Personal Information to provide and improve our Services, to send you marketing/advertisement communications                 that we believe may be of interest to you, to contact you in connection with the Services and certain programs                 or offerings that you may have registered for, and to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the                 Services that you are authorized to access.
We may use your designated email address to: (i) send you updates or news regarding the Services and our products; and/or                 (ii) respond to a “Contact Us” or administrative request (for example, to change your password).
If you choose to send your friend an invitation email or message we will use the contact information that you provide,                 or make available, to automatically send your friend an invitation email or message. Your name and email address                 may be included in the invitation email or message.
We may transfer your Personal Information to our local or foreign subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose                 of storing or processing such information on our behalf. Such information may be transferred to other countries.                 We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.
We may share your Personal Information with our third party service providers and partners, but only to assist us with                 our business operations and to provide our Services to you and other users. Such information may be transferred                 to other countries. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service                 providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information.
We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Services if we have a good faith                 belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable                 law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms, including investigations of potential                 violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against                 harm to the rights, property or safety of StreamElements, our users, yourself or the public.
Use of Anonymous Information. We may use Anonymous Information (as defined below) or disclose it to third party service providers             in order to improve our Services and enhance your experience with the Services. We may also disclose Anonymous Information             (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners. “Anonymous Information” means             information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about the             use of our Services.
Opting Out. You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Services-related emails from us by selecting             an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that we send. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the             foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any “Contact Us” request as well as administrative emails (for             example, in connection with a password reset request) that are necessary to facilitate your use of the Services.
Choice. At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information. If you choose not to provide             mandatory Personal Information, you may still visit parts of the Services but you may be unable to access certain             options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
Access/Accuracy. To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, we wish to maintain accurate Personal Information.             If you would like to delete or correct any of your other Personal Information that we may be storing, you may submit             an access request by sending an email to privacy@streamelements.com. Your email should include adequate details of             your request.
Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products. The Services may enable you to interact with or contain links to your             Third Party Account and other third party websites, mobile software applications and services that are not owned             or controlled by us (each a “Third Party Service”). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content             of such Third Party Services. Please be aware that Third Party Services may collect Personal Information from you.             Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Service that             you choose to use or interact with.
Children’s Privacy. The Services are not structured to attract children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not             intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected             Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you             believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at privacy@streamelements.com.
Security. The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including             the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted             to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore,             while we strive to use reasonable acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its             absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the Service, you can contact us             at privacy@streamelements.com.
Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy. In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of             bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information in connection with             the foregoing events.
California Privacy Rights. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request             certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing             purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@streamelements.com. Please note that we are only             required to respond to one request per customer each year.
Our California Do Not Track Notice. We may collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online             activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Services. If you choose to operate your             web browser “do not track” signals or any other mechanism that provides consumers the ability to exercise choice             regarding the collection of such information, we will abide by your request and stop collecting such information.             We may allow third parties such as such as companies that provide us with analytics tools, to collect personally             identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites             when a consumer uses the Services.
Deletion of Content from California Residents. If you are a California resident under the age of 18 and a registered user,             California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to remove content or Personal Information you             have publicly posted. If you wish to remove such content or Personal Information and you specify which content or             Personal Information you wish to be removed, we will do so in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware that             after removal you will not be able to restore removed content. In addition, such removal does not ensure complete             or comprehensive removal of the content or Personal Information you have posted and that there may be circumstances             in which the law does not require us to enable removal of content.
Commitment. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly             evolving our Service to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, or             your Personal Information that we may be storing and using, please contact us at privacy@streamelements.com.
