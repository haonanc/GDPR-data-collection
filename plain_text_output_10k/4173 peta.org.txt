Privacy Policy
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) strongly believes in protecting the integrity and privacy of personal information gathered from our members and visitors to our Web sites. Since the protection of your privacy is of great importance to us, we have created this privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of personal information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, phone number, e-mail address, or any other information, provided to us by our members and Web site visitors.
These policies do not extend to external sites linked to our Shopping Mall or other non-PETA.org Web site content. Please check with these companies and sites for their policies regarding data privacy, including the use of “cookies.”

Does PETA use cookies on its Web sites?
PETA uses “cookies” on some Web pages. A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a visitor’s hard drive but that does not itself contain any personal information. Cookies enhance a visitor’s experience by saving the visitor from having to log in or provide information each time he or she revisits a PETA Web page and by customizing content based on a visitor’s interests. Visitors can configure their browsers to be alerted when a site is attempting to send a cookie and refuse the cookie, though some PETA e-commerce pages will not function properly without accepting cookies.
PETA also uses cookies to administer the Web site, track visitor movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
How is information used in PETA e-news?

From time to time, we may send out e-mail messages that might include information about these like-minded organizations and companies, but we do not provide them with access to any personal information that you have provided.
In order to provide you with better and more relevant information, we compile information about e-mail response and Web site usage. This information helps us to better understand site usage patterns and also what types of content and information may help improve your user experience on PETA’s Web site.
