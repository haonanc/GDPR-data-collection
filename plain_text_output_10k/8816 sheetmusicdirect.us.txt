Uses made of the information
We comply with the law. We will only use your personal data to the extent that the law allows                         us to do so. Under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ) we will rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal data:
where it is necessary to perform a contract we have entered into or are about to enter into with                                 you;
where it is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests (or those of a third party)                                 and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Our                                 legitimate interest means our interest in conducting and managing our business, including                                 enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the best products and services we                                 can and the best and most secure experience when dealing with us. In assessing our legitimate                                 interests, we make sure we consider and balance any potential impact (both positive and negative)                                 on you and others and your rights;
where you have given us your consent.
Information you give to us. We will use this information:

to provide your information to our marketing department who may contact you to request feedback                                 and comments on our products or services or to provide information to you which may be of                                 interest to you;
to provide you, or permit selected third parties to provide you, with information about goods                                 or services we feel may interest you. If you are an existing customer, we will only contact                                 you by electronic means (such as e-mail or SMS) with information about products and services                                 similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.                                 If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we                                 (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. If you                                 do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties                                 for marketing purposes, you will be able to withdraw your consent by contacting privacy@sheetmusicdirect.com ;

to make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of our site about products or                                 services that may interest you or them;
Information we receive from other sources. We will use this information to combine with                         information you give to us and information we collect about you. We will use this information and                         the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we                         receive).
Disclosure of your information
You agree that we have the right to share your personal data with selected third parties including:
entities that provide customer service applications to us to better enable us to respond to your                                 requests for information or assistance;
business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with you or them, for example suppliers of shipping services to fulfil your orders for                                 physical products;
credit card processors and other payment services providers, for the purposes of effecting payments                                 by or to you;
entities who provide services to us in relation to marketing, in order to assist us in marketing                                to you as described above;
advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts                                 to you and others;
cloud service providers, including the entity that hosts this website, for the purposes of storage                                 and such hosting;
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our                                 site; and
We will disclose your personal data to third parties:
if Hal Leonard LLC or all or substantially all its assets or the relevant part of its assets                                 (e.g. those associated with its Sheet Music Direct business) are acquired by a third party,                                 in which case personal data held by it about its customers (or the relevant customers) will                                 be one of the transferred assets; or
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to: comply with any legal                                 obligation; or to enforce or apply our standard terms and conditions of business and other                                 agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Hal Leonard LLC, our clients,                                 or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for                                 the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
Where we store your personal data
All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. These may be located anywhere in the world,                         including the USA. See below concerning international transfers of personal data.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we                         will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted                         to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will                         use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. This includes                         encryption of some information.
We will also require third parties to whom we disclose your personal data to take appropriate measures                         to ensure the security of your personal data and not to use it except for the purposes for which                         we disclose it to them.
International transfers of personal data
Many of our external third parties to whom we transfer your personal data as described above are based                         outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside                         the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded                         to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European                                 Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details,                                 see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries .
Where we use providers based in the United States of America, we may transfer data to them if                                 they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to                                 personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield .
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring                     your personal data out of the EEA.
Retention of personal data
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected                         your personal data.
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and                         sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure                         of that personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve                         those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. If by law we are required                         to retain any information about our customers or their interactions with us, we will retain your                         personal data insofar as required to comply with such law.
We may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or                         statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice                         to you.
Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have the right to:
Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request").                                 This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that                                 we are lawfully processing it.
Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you                                 to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may                                 need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove                                 personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have                                 the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data in certain other circumstances,                                 namely where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),                                 where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase                                 your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able                                 to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified                                 to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate                                 interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation                                 which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your                                 fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing                                 your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that                                 we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights                                 and freedoms.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to                                 ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to                                 establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to another person or entity.                                 In that case we will provide to you, or to the person or entity to whom you wish us to transfer                                 your personal data, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal                                 data. However this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you                                 withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain                                 products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw                                 your consent.
Lodge a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) or another                                 applicable regulator. If you have any complaints about the way in which we process your personal                                 data please do contact us, as set out below, as we would appreciate the opportunity to resolve                                 your complaint.
If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal data, object to the processing                             of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal data to another party,                             please contact us using the contact details provided below.
