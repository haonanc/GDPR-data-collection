This Privacy Policy is effective as of July 18, 2018.
Welcome to the MYMOVE.com website (the “Site”), and thank you for taking the time to read our Privacy Policy.
The Site is owned and operated by MYMOVE, LLC (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), a Red Ventures company. We are committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to our Site. This Policy describes how our Site operates, and how we currently collect, use, and share information gathered from our online visitors, as well as information derived from emails, texts, and other electronic messages between you and this Site.
The following topics are presented in this Privacy Policy:
Collecting and Using Personal Information from Website Visitors:
In order to provide you with access to certain services or data within our Site, we may require that you provide certain personal information. This information may include your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, credit card number, subscriber name or screen name, and password used to access our services.
The personal information you provide when you become a registered user or customer of the Site is used primarily to help us customize your online experience, increase the convenience of accessing new tools, products and services, and (if applicable) provide the products and/or services you purchase or request. This personal information may also be used to make your use of the Site more convenient by, for example, limiting the number of times you have to register with us. If registration is available and you register with the Site, you will be assigned a unique identifier in our record system, which, together with your password, is designed to prevent unauthorized access to any information you choose to store on the Site. The data you give us about your personal preferences and demographics (e.g., ZIP Code, occupation or the like) may be used to help us offer content, advertisements, products, and services that we believe will be of interest to you. Also, we may share this information with our current and potential advertisers so that they can present advertisements more effectively.
In addition, we collect information provided by visitors in registration forms, surveys, contest entries, emails, texts, and other submissions or electronic messaging to us. If you choose to participate in any such activities, we may receive or request certain personal information from you. Participation in these activities is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as ZIP Code). We use this information to monitor site traffic or personalize websites (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), notify contest winners and award prizes, and to send emails or other electronic communication to participants.
We also collect and track automatically (1) the home server domain names, IP addresses, type of client computer, and type of web browser of visitors to our Site, and (2) aggregate and specific information on what pages visitors access.
Personal information we collect through our Site will be used, among other things, for: fulfillment of orders and requests for information, marketing and promotion of products and services of Company and other entities that we believe you may find of interest, feedback purposes, statistical analysis of users' behavior, product development or enhancement, content improvement, notification of upcoming events, and customization of content and layout of our websites. Names, postal and e-mail addresses, and phone numbers collected through our Site may be used to contact you regarding products and services and upcoming events we believe you might find of interest.
We also may use the personal information you provide for our internal purposes, such as administration and operation of our websites, data analytics, and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures. We may combine your personal information with other information collected from and about you on the Site, from third parties, or from other online and offline sources.
Collecting Order Information
The information collection described above may use several automatic data collection tools and techniques, including cookies, clickstream, and web beacons.
Cookies and Tracking Technologies: Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Company and our partners and affiliates, or by analytics applications. These technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users’ movements around the Site and other websites, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies on an individual as well as aggregated basis. We use cookies to remember users’ settings (e.g., language preference) and customize their experiences, as well as for user authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Site may be limited.
Log Files: As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you, in part to improve Site functionality and the services we make available to you.

Local Storage: We use Local Storage (LS) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LS such as HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.
Single Sign-On: You may log in to the Site using sign-on services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us to pre-populate our registration form, such as your name and email address. These sign-on services may also give you the option to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page for sharing with others in your network.
Social Media Widgets: Our Site may include social media features such as the Facebook Like button or other features that allow you to share content or experiences on our Site or interact with our Site using the feature. These features may collect your IP address and the page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the social media feature to function properly. These social media features are hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.
