Privacy Policy
PetSmart wants you to know how we collect, use, share and protect information about you online and in our stores. By interacting with us, you consent to our use of information that is collected or submitted as we describe in our privacy policy. We may change or add to this privacy policy, so we urge you to review it periodically.
WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED
Your name
Your credit/debit card number
Your location
Your pet’s information (name, breed, date of birth, gender, veterinary information, photographs, etc.)
If you choose not to provide personal information, we may not be able to provide you with requested products, services or information.
Automated Information Collection
We may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a PetSmart customer. If we are able to identify you as a PetSmart customer, we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in our stores. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in-store, mobile, etc.
PetSmart Automated Information Collection
We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us through your computer or mobile device. This information, which includes the pages you visit on our site, which web address you came from, the type of device you are using, purchase information and checkout process, search terms and geographic location, helps us recognize you, customize your website experience and make our marketing messages more relevant. These technologies also enable us to provide features such as storage of items in your cart between visits and SMS/text messages you have chosen to receive. We also use Flash cookies for fraud prevention and other purposes.
In order to provide the best customer experience possible, we also use these technologies for reporting and analysis purposes, including how you are shopping our website, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.
Third-Party Automated Information Collection
In certain instances, we allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our website and to use that information to serve ads for PetSmart products and services or for the products and services of other companies when you visit our website or other websites. These companies use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to customize your shopping experience and to provide advertisements about products and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These parties typically use a cookie or a third-party web beacons, and similar technologies to collect this information. Some browsers have a 'do not track' feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Neither PetSmart nor its third-party providers have a systematic method for ensuring that browser 'Do Not Track' requests are consistently honored. However, you may learn more about online advertising and opt out of the use of your web browsing activity to serve targeted ads by companies that participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ .
Our Mobile App and Mobile Website
Our PetSmart mobile app is downloadable onto smart phones and serves as a mechanism to take you to our mobile website. Our mobile website collects the same type of information outlined throughout this policy.
Our Mobile Programs
By participating in any of our mobile programs you are agreeing to receive automated marketing phone calls and text marketing messages at the phone number you provide at opt-in. Your consent to receive such marketing messages is not required to make a purchase. You understand and agree that the phone calls made and text messages sent to your mobile phone/device may be generated using automated telephone dialing technology. You agree to notify PetSmart at 1-855-537-0295 in the event that you change or disconnect your mobile phone number.
Message and data rates may apply. All charges are billed by and payable to your mobile service provider. PetSmart will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any messages as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your mobile service provider. For those using T-Mobile as their carrier, T-Mobile is not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
PetSmart text alerts are recurring. For PetSmart general promotional messages at 84848, you can text 'HELP' to 84848. To cancel, you can text 'STOP' to 84848. For PetSmart Treats promotional messages at 408408, you can text 'HELP' to 408408. To cancel, you can text 'STOP' to 408408.
PetSmart reserves the right to remove subscribers at our discretion. Terms are subject to change.
User Experience Information
In order to improve your online shopping experience, to help with fraud identification, and to assist our Customer Care Representatives in resolving issues you may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information. This includes: Login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g. information entered during checkout process), and browser information.
Social Media Widgets
petsmart.com includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, YouTube and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.
Information from Other Sources
We may collect data that’s publicly available. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g. a blog, chat room, or social media) can be read, collected, or used by us and others, and could be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to submit in these instances.
We also obtain information provided by third parties. For instance, we obtain information from companies that can enhance our existing customer information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our customers (for example, adding address information). This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you.
In-Store Cameras
We use in-store cameras for security purposes and for operational purposes such as measuring and observing customer traffic patterns.
Geo-Location Tracking
Certain mobile devices contain geo-location tracking capability. We may use such capability or other geo-location tracking technology to generally identify your location in our store or your close proximity to it for marketing, to generate coupons and other offers, for analytical purposes and to prompt our associates as to which customers may need help.

Examples of how we use the information we collect include (but are not limited to):

We may also use the photographs on social media.
