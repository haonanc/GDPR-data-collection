The Container Store does not sell or share your personal information with other companies for their marketing  efforts.  We pride ourselves on providing exceptional customer service. Not only are we committed to helping you  organize your life, we also want to make sure you clearly understand how we use information about you to provide  you with the best possible shopping experience.  We value the trust you place in The Container Store and we want  to ensure that you understand what information we gather about you, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in  place to protect it.
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by The Container Store through our Internet website (currently  located at www.containerstore.com ) and our associated mobile sites (collectively our "Site"),  our contact centers,  including our toll-free number, Customer Solutions email service, or online chat (collectively  our "Contact Center"), and our store locations (our "Stores"). It is designed to ensure that our customers understand  how and why The Container Store collects and uses the information provided to us. You can learn how to opt out of  receiving catalogs, e-mails and other marketing materials from us here .
The following topics are addressed in this Privacy Policy:

If there are material changes in the way we will use or share personal information about you, we will provide notice of our revised Privacy Policy when you access your online account or provide you with an email notification.

If you choose to do so, those credentials may be communicated to and used by a third party service provider to authenticate your credentials and ensure that access to your account is obtained properly, and to facilitate your use of you social network log-in to access your account with us.

Your use of the Forums may reveal your user name, city and state, and may allow you to publish certain other personal information about yourself.

How We May Use Your Information
In order to serve you better, we may combine the information you provide us and the information we have from your purchases through our Site, through our Contact Center, online and in our Stores. We may also utilize information that is publicly available. This information, in total, is used to improve your overall experience with our company. Here are the ways we may use information about you in order to enhance your shopping experience at The Container Store:
To complete your purchases.  We use information about your transactions, including personal information you have provided, in order to process payments you have made and deliver products you have ordered. In doing so, we may transmit payment information to third parties, such as banks, credit card companies or payment clearance services. We may also provide shipping information to third parties in order to permit them to deliver products to you.
For marketing and promotional purposes.  We send targeted direct mail and catalogs to our customers about products or events that we think may be of interest, based on past purchases at The Container Store. We may also send offers for discounts or promotions and information about campaigns, new products or new features. In addition, we send email communications to let customers know about promotions, organizational tips, and the most up-to-date happenings at The Container Store. However, you can opt out of receiving catalogs, e-mails and other marketing materials from us. Information on how to opt out is provided below .

To enhance your online shopping experience.  For example, we may use information about you to recognize you and welcome you back to our Site, personalizing your shopping experience, or to place advertisements or links on this Site for goods and services likely to be of interest to you.
To make your use of our Site compatible with the social networks you use.  For example, we and/or service providers we use may use your personal information to make it possible for you to access your account with The Container Store using the log-in information you use for your social network account, or in connection with allowing you to share information about your activities on our Site through your social networks.
Sharing Your Information and Third-party Partnerships
As previously stated, we do not sell or share your personal information with other companies for their marketing efforts.  On occasion, The Container Store shares information collected from our customers with selected third-party companies who help assist us in our own advertising and marketing efforts. For example, we may retain an outside company to help us with customer research or to manage a customer database, to send catalogs or direct mail, or to send email messages. The information we provide to third parties for such purposes may include your name, address, email address, Site usage, and purchase information, which will help us target marketing communications. The Container Store also provides some anonymous information about customer purchases to third-party companies that assist us with advertising and promoting our products and services.
You can opt out of receiving catalogs, e-mails and other marketing materials from us. Information on how to opt out is provided below .
We participate in special partnerships with other companies that we believe offer products or services that our customers would be interested in and would benefit from. We do not share customers' personal information with these partner companies. Customers may receive information about these partnerships and related promotions directly from The Container Store or from the third-party companies that assist us with marketing.
The Container Store may also enter into a "co-branding" relationship with another company, or organization. At times, we may communicate with customers on behalf of that company and customers may be directed to a partner website to purchase a specific item or learn about their services. In these cases, both The Container Store and the partner company may receive personal information you provide.
Additionally, like many other companies, The Container Store may use outside marketing companies to place advertisements or links on other websites. When you visit this Site, these companies may collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., your IP address, click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) about your visits to this Site and your visits to other websites over time in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information about your online activities over time and across different web sites. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising by certain participating advertising networks, you can visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ and http://www.networkadvertising.org In addition, Google permits you  to opt-out of some of their services by using Google Ads Settings ,  and provides information and additional opt-out options for Google Analytics here and here .  The Container Store is not responsible for the collection or use of information by such marketing companies or third-party websites.
Third parties may receive your personal information because you have visited their websites or accessed their links. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn about how they handle your personal information. Please note that The Container Store has no control over the privacy practices of other companies of websites, and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for any third-party's data collection or disclosure practices, their failure to abide by their privacy policies, or the content of their websites.
In the event that The Container Store is merged with or acquired by another company, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and other information about usage of our Site in connection with such a transaction. In the event of such a transfer, we will notify you of the change of control of your personal information. You should also be aware that courts may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information and other information about usage of our Site to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.
Disclosure of Your Personal Information
We will not use or disclose your personal information except: (1) as described in this Privacy Policy; (2) after obtaining your permission to a specific use or disclosure; (3) if it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to The Container Store, or to others; (4) if we are required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as a court order, search warrant, subpoena, civil discovery request, or statutory requirement); or, (5) as we otherwise believe is required by law.
Security of Our Site
The Container Store maintains security procedures designed to keep information we own, license and process from being accessed by any unauthorized person or business. We use a variety of multi-level security systems to control access to our systems and the data that we house. Our enterprise security operations center maintains real-time monitoring for information system vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts into our internal systems. We also maintain physical security for our facilities and limit access to certain critical areas of our business.

We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not share it with anyone. Always sign out from your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to our Site. This ensures that others cannot access your account, which is especially important if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.
