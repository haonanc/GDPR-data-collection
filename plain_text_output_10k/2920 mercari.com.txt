This information, combined with the details you have provided us with, enables us to            customise your visits and enhance your shopping experience by gathering demographic            information about you. It may also help us diagnose problems with our servers and            software. The above personal information is processed for the purposes of our            legitimate commercial interest in improving and developing the Service for your            individual needs and also for the evolution of the Service generally. However,            in order to safeguard your rights as a user we only use pseudonymous personal information            or anonymous data so that it is not possible to identify you as an individual without            additional information. Please note that we will not attempt to identify you as an            individual using any pseudonymous personal information in our possession and that we cannot identify you as an individual using anonymous data in our possession.
We may also receive information about you if you use any of the other websites            we operate or the other services we provide. We work closely with third parties            (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment            and delivery services and advertising networks) and may receive information about            you from them. We allow these third parties to obtain personal information for            providing support services. Please note, our third party contractors may change            from time to time as we continue to offer more services and continue to improve            our offerings. Such third parties may have access to your personal information            for the purposes of  providing services on our behalf as processors, but they may            not use your information for any other purpose beyond what we direct them to do.
As Merpay is an authorised electronic money institution ("EMI") authorised and            regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, it is required to comply with anti            money laundering and counter terrorist financing legislation, and financial and            payment services regulations. Therefore, Merpay is required identify and verify users.            Merpay is required to verify customers and we do by requesting personal information from you (see Section 1:            Customer Due Diligence) and then verifying that information by checking that            it against information held by third party verification service providers (i.e.            Sift Science, KYC6 and ID3Global GB Group) - this information is usually from            within the European Economic Area ("EEA") but may be processed outside the EEA.

Under GDPR your consent to the processing of personal information must be a statement            or a clear affirmative action that is freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.            Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information you have the right            to withdraw that consent at any time (see section 2: Electronic Marketing).
2. How do we use the information we collect?
We use personal information in the following ways:
To facilitate payments between the users of the Mercari online marketplace in relation              to the sale and purchase of goods and to provide e-money accounts and services.              This will involve the transfer of your personal information (including financial data)              from Mercari Europe to Merpay.
To provide you – subject to your marketing preferences – with information about product              upgrades, new products, services, newsletters, informative emails and research on              future product ideas or improvements.
To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you.

Mercari Europe and Merpay share between themselves personal information that they            have collected from you or have received from third party verification service            providers (i.e. Sift Science, KYC6 and ID3Global GB Group). Please note we will            only use and/or share the minimum amount of personal information that is required            to achieve our objectives.
Retention
We only retain personal information for as long as we need it for our business purposes,            e.g. the provision of the Service. Where possible we will pseudonymise or anonymise            personal information for our use in order to protect it.
We will retain personal information about a user’s identity, the purchases and sales            made by the user, and the user’s conduct during their relationship with us for a period            of 6 years commencing on the termination of our relationship. We do this in case there            is a complaint regarding our conduct or the user’s conduct during the period of our            relationship so that we can defend any claims or counterclaims made against us.
Where Merpay is required as an EMI to collect and retain personal information            in compliance with the law, Merpay does so for the minimum retention period specified            by law taking into account practical considerations. Merpay will retain personal            information related to customer due diligence for a period of 5 years commencing            on the termination of our relationship. Merpay will retain personal information            related to a payment transaction for a period of 5 years commencing on the date            of the payment transaction.
Electronic Marketing
From time to time, we may send you marketing emails with information about new            products and services, as well as newsletters relating to our product and services            offerings to the extent you have consented to the receipt of such marketing emails or            the sending of such marketing emails is otherwise permitted by applicable laws. If            you sign up for our marketing email list or for the marketing email list for an affiliate            brand, then you will be asked to provide your email address. If you do not wish to            receive emails from Mercari, then please click on the unsubscribe link provided in the            email in question. Generally, we use information from our marketing and research            communications in an aggregated and anonymised way.
As a user of the Service, our processing of your personal information for marketing            and other advertising purposes is based on your consent. Within the App you have an            online switch that allows you to consent to receiving direct marketing from us, or            withdraw that consent. You may opt out of receiving such material at any time by going            to your privacy settings and selecting withdraw your consent "Marketing emails".

Right to restriction of processing
We will restrict the processing of personal information in the following circumstances:
Where you contest the accuracy of the personal information, we will restrict the processing              until we have verified the accuracy of the personal information.
Where you have objected to the processing (where it was necessary for the performance of a              public interest task or purpose of legitimate interests), and we are considering whether our              legitimate grounds override your interest, rights and freedoms.
When processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead.
If we no longer need the personal information but you require the data to establish,              exercise or defend a legal claim.
If we have disclosed personal information that is to be subject to restriction to third parties,            we will contact each third party and inform them of the restriction unless this proves impossible            or involves disproportionate effort.
