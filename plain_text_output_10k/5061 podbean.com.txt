Podbean's privacy policy covers the collection and use of personal information that may be collected by Podbean anytime you interact with Podbean, such as when you use Podbean’s sites, services, mobile applications, products, and content (“Services”), or when you call our sales or support associates. Please take a moment to review the following to learn more about our information practices, including what type of information is gathered, how the information is used and for what purposes, to whom we disclose the information, and how we safeguard your personal information. Your privacy is important to us at Podbean.
This policy covers how Podbean treats personal information that Podbean collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Podbean Services. This privacy policy is part of our terms of use.
Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Podbean does not own or control, or to people that Podbean does not employ or manage.
Information You Provide
This is information that you provide to us through text fields, such as your name, password and payment information. The information we collect is different depending on if you:

become designated by an Account Owner as an Administrator or a Content Contributor ("Admin(s)");
sign up as an advertiser who creates and run advertising campaigns on Podbean (“Advertiser(s)”);
become a paid subscriber to a premium podcast (“Premium Member(s)”);

Note for “Podcasters”:
Auto Social Sharing: When you authorize Podbean to share your podcast to social media or other distribution methods, you may be asked to provide account owner credentials for those services that require access to your personal account. Anytime you are asked to provide personal account credentials for outside services, you are actually entering your login information directly to those systems. We do not collect, store or otherwise process login credentials to your personal accounts on our systems. Those sites send back an Oauth Access Token that enables us to post on your behalf. We do not retrieve any other personal or public information. You should review information about their data handling policies and terms of service.
Do Not Track
Our service does not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means our third party analytics providers may associate your usage on Podbean with your usage on other sites.
Information We Collect
We collect information automatically as you navigate the site or through our third party analytics providers. We may store usage information such as the type of device you use to access Podbean, your operating system, browser type, IP address, and device ID, the pages you visit or request, links clicked, referring sites, user interactions and your search terms. When you use Podbean’s apps, we may collect information include your mobile device information (e.g., device model, operating system version, device date and time, unique device identifiers, mobile network information) and how you use the apps. We also derive your location from your IP address. These types of information do not generally identify or relate to you as an individual; however we may associate these types of information with you as an individual.
We process limited podcast audience information using the combination of IP Address and User Agent (a string of characters that identifies the type/version of software that you are using to access content) to track podcast statistics. We do not expose or make this information available in any way to any third-parties (including podcasters) that would identify individual listeners. We only provide podcasters with aggregated statistics through the Podbean user interface. We reserve the right to research specific IP Addresses as may be necessary to protect our podcast services, our company/employees, our customers, and/or our systems. For example, we would research an IP Address that accessed our systems in the case of a suspected bot, rogue server or bad actor that may be affecting service delivery or performance. The logs of raw data containing this information are routinely purged.
