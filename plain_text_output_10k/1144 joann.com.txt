PRIVACY POLICY
At JOANN, your trust and satisfaction is a priority. We know that your privacy is important, and that is why we take care to safeguard the confidentiality and security of your information. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you of our policies and practices regarding our use and disclosure of the information that you submit to us, and the information that we collect from you through our web site, our mobile applications, and in our retail stores.
Whenever we use the words "we" or "us" or “JOANN,” we are referring to Jo-Ann Stores LLC, (doing business as JOANN), and to the affiliates and parent companies of Jo-Ann Stores, LLC, including Joann.com, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jo-Ann Stores, LLC. Whenever we use the words "our web site," we are referring to http://www.joann.com , http://plus.joann.com , and to our mobile application(s) (“app”).
This Privacy Policy is divided into the following sections:
"De-identified Information" means information that is no longer associated with you, or linked to your Personal Information (as defined below). De-identified Information does not reference the identities of individual persons.
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a web site, including our web site, sends to your computer or to your mobile device while you are viewing a web site. We use both session Cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personalized and interactive experience on our web site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our web site may not work properly.
An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, tablet or other device when you use the Internet / world wide web. In some cases, your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer internet service provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses in conjunction with session Cookies to analyze our web page traffic flow and also to identify location of the computer.
"Personal Information" is information about you that is linked to you as an individual, such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, full credit card number and expiration date, account username and log-in password to our web site. Personal Information does not include technical information such as unique device identifiers, randomly assigned unique identifiers in cookies, mobile device name or identifier, or IP addresses, unless that technical information is linked to you personally as an identifiable individual by associating the technical information with other Personal Information.
As detailed below, we and our business partners obtain and keep Personal Information when you send us an email, order or purchase product in our stores or on our web site, sign up for one of our preferred customer programs, VIP program, text messaging (SMS) program or other various programs, supply information to our Career Center, or communicate with us.
2. Consent
Our web site is maintained in the state of Ohio in the United States, and by submitting your Personal Information to us, either through our web site, in our stores, or by other means, you are agreeing to the collection and storage of your Personal Information in the United States.
When you submit Personal Information and De-identified Information to us, either through our web site, in our stores, or by other avenues, it means that you have agreed to this Privacy Policy, and that you expressly consent to the use of your Personal Information in the United States, according to this Privacy Policy.
Please note that your Personal Information may be used by JOANN in the country where it was collected, as well as in the United States, where laws regarding the use of Personal Information may be less strict than the laws in your country.

4. How We Use Personal Information
We use your Personal Information to respond to requests that you make, to help us serve you better, to provide advertisements and marketing to you, and to provide you with a personalized web site experience. If you have signed up to receive email from us or for text messages, we also use your Personal Information to provide you with promotional emails and text messages for our products, and for other marketing and advertising purposes.
For example, based on your shopping habits when you visit our web site (what items you browse, what items you place in your shopping cart, and what items you purchase), or based on your shopping habits when you purchase items in our store, we and our marketing partner(s), on our behalf, may send you personalized advertisements that identify products we think you may be interested in. See Section 6 for more information. We may also use your shopping habits to send you personalized email or text message product alerts.
Personal Information that we collect from a particular browser or device, including a mobile device, may be used with another computer or device that we have linked to the original browser or device, including a mobile device, on which such Personal Information was collected.
We limit our employees' access to Personal Information to those employees with a business reason for knowing such information, and those employees will use the information only for business reasons.
We may create De-identified Information from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this De-identified Information to analyze request patterns and usage patterns so that we may enhance our products and services. As this De-identified Information does not identify you, we use and disclose De-identified Information to third parties at our discretion.
If you provide feedback on any of our products and services, we may use your feedback for any purpose. We will collect any information contained in your communication and will treat the Personal Information in the communication in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
5. Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties. When you purchase a product or a service from our web site, or when you special order a product or service from our stores, we will share Personal Information with third party fulfillment companies in the United States, in order to deliver the product or service to you. We also share your Personal Information with third party service providers in the United States that provide advertising and marketing services for us, including distribution of postal mail, electronic alerts, email, electronic (digital) advertisements, and mobile text messages to our customers and potential customers. These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Information, except to provide the services requested by us, and they are bound by confidentiality agreements for their use of your Personal Information. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Information with our third party service providers in the United States.
We reserve the right to share some or all of your Personal Information with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other companies in the United States under the common control of JOANN (collectively, "Affiliates"), for the purposes described in this policy. We will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Information, we may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with laws or to respond to subpoenas or other judicial orders served on us, or (b) to protect and defend the rights or property of JOANN or third parties.
To provide offers that are of interest to you, we may allow other companies to place advertisements and other technology on our web site. As a result of your visit to our web site, advertisement server companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address, and clickstream information. See Section 6 for more information.
We may also use and disclose Personal Information for fraud detection and prevention. Personal Information and device identification information may be combined with information from other sources and used by us, or by a third party retained by us, to help detect and prevent fraud, credit card fraud, or other illegal or illegitimate activity. All or part of your Personal Information or device identification information may be kept by us or kept by the third parties involved in fraud detection, and used in future fraud prevention efforts. Information that is believed to be fraudulent may be shared with other retailers, banks, and law enforcement to help prevent illegal activity.
We may use and disclose Personal Information in connection with a contemplated reorganization or an actual reorganization of our business, in connection with financing, a sale or other transaction involving the disposal of all or part of our business or assets, including for the purpose of permitting the due diligence required to decide whether to proceed with a transaction. If the sale occurs, the purchaser will be entitled to use and disclose the Personal Information collected by us, and the purchaser will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
6. Advertising
We use "interest-based" advertisements, also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior. We share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct advertising campaigns for us. Third parties and their affiliates collect certain information as a result of their "tags" and other automated technology being on our website. The information that they collect includes the name (URL) of the web pages you view while on our site, your IP address, time of visit, information about your browser software, information about your device, and randomly-assigned identifiers stored in Cookies, which they use to target and serve advertising to you. We will use all this information to serve advertising to you.
In connection with online behavioral advertising, some third parties involved in advertising may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, and they may then display advertisements on those additional devices.
Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third parties as defined by the initiative. For more information, visit http://www.w3.org/ .  As explained below, some web sites, including our web site, will ignore a “do-not-track” signal.
As required by Section 22575 of the California Business and Professions Code, the following disclosure is made to California residents and to residents of other states: Our web site does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser. As described in Section 3, we use Cookies and other tools to collect information about you when you visit our web site to better tailor the features, performance and support of our products, services, stores, and web site. After you leave our web site, we do not track your online activity on other web sites, but third parties (and their affiliates) may track your online activity to offer you advertisements.
You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. To some extent you can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ . The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser. You may also visit the web site of the Network Advertising Initiative and use its opt-out: https://www.networkadvertising.org/. Different companies may belong to one or more advertising organizations, and opting out from one or more groups may not stop all interest-based advertisements. As explained in Section 11, we do not represent or warrant that the actions taken on other web sites will be effective or that all advertisements will be blocked.
For mobile devices and applications, you can visit the following website to opt-out of behavioral advertising: http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices . As explained in Section 11, we do not represent or warrant that the actions taken on other web sites will be effective or that all advertisements will be blocked. See also Section 8 for more information on mobile applications, geo-location tracking, and opt-outs.
Opt-outs are unique to each mobile device or web browser. An opt-out completed on a specific web browser will not transfer to other browsers or to your mobile device. An opt-out completed on your mobile device will not transfer to a different mobile device or to web browsers.
As an alternative to the DAA opt-out, you can also elect to block all Cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and Cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software. For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you can block both first-party and third-party cookies by selecting those options at Tools/Internet Options/Privacy/Settings-Advanced/Override Automatic Cookie Handling. Also, if you are using Firefox 25, you can "uncheck" Accept All Cookies under Firefox Preferences/Privacy-Use Custom Settings For History/Accept Cookies from Sites. If you block Cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly. We do not represent or warrant that these actions will be effective to accomplish their purpose.
We use a third party service provider to manage our product review system. When you submit product reviews on our website, our third party service provider may place Cookies on your browser and offer advertising to you. For more information on how this provider uses your information, please visit this link: http://go.bazaarvoice.com/848PGD1740001EG001ipQ00
7. Social Network Widgets; External Ad Blocking
Our website may include social network or other third–party plug–ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with our web pages that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget.

If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share.
Our website includes an external advertisement blocking service that attempts to block advertisements and other “pop-ups” that are not authorized by us when visitors come to our web site. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you while visiting our web site. We make no representation or warranty that the service will stop any or all unauthorized advertisements or pop-ups while visiting our web site.

We also collect information regarding the type of mobile device, operating system version, IP address, geo-location, device name, and unique device identifiers. See also Section 3 for additional information that we collect. If you do not want your geo-location information to be collected, you can go to “settings” or similar function of your mobile device and disable the location feature. In addition, you can visit the following website and opt-out of some geo-location tracking by the participating companies: https://optout.smart-places.org/ .
