When ordered, most Pro devices require user ear impressions either digitized or molds. This information is usually performed by a third party, an audiologist.  Impressions are molds taken of your ear canal, and then produced through a 3D printing process which makes the fit better than ever. User impressions are retained in case of loss, re-ordering or if re-production is necessary or until a user requests that they be discarded.
WE WILL NOW PROCESS YOUR REQUEST. THANK YOU!
