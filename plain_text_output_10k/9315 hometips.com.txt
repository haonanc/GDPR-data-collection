Thank you for visiting HomeTips. Your privacy is important to us. We will endeavor to respect and protect it. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site. Please read this privacy policy carefully so that you understand our privacy practices regarding:
Children under 13;
How we use the information;
Opt-out options.
Home Tips cares about the safety of children.
Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. Kids under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to post on our site. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information.
Information we do and don’t collect
The information we gather on our site falls into two categories:
* Personally identifying information (such as your name, mailing address and email address) you supply when you initiate transactions, register to receive catalogs or newsletters, or use our bulletin boards if or when we have them; and
* Completely anonymous tracking information we collect as you navigate through our site.
Additionally, third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website — such as vendors of products and services offered through our site — may gather the same kinds of information.
How we use the information we collect
We use the personally identifiable information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services; to respond to your inquiries; to send you e-mail newsletters you have requested; and to offer you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you– but only if you opt to receive this information.
In general, it is our policy not to share your e-mail address or any phone numbers you may provide us with any third-party organizations. We do not share our e-mail mailing list with third parties.
Please note, however, that our site also may include links to other websites, and we provide access to products and services offered by third parties. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary to provide the products or services. We will not provide your email address to such third parties unless it’s necessary to provide services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion. For example, we will provide your name and e-mail address to a marketing partner from which you’re purchasing goods or services, or from which you are requesting a catalog.
We also provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don’t control. The privacy policies of these third party sites may differ from ours. If you can’t find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners through a link either from the site’s homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.
If you ever receive mailings from us that you do not wish to receive, please tell us by sending an e-mail to this address: admin[@]hometips.com. Please include your name and complete mailing address so we can remove you from our database. Additionally, you will find further opt-out instructions below in this privacy policy.
We may work with a data provider to target advertising to you personally, through online and offline methods including email, display media, video media and direct mail. These providers may use personal information that we have collected or that you have provided to locate you online, such as when you visit or log in to the website(s) or mobile applications. When you log in to or visit our website, your IP address may be combined with other de-identified data (such as a hashed, non-readable email or postal address) in order to send ads and materials to you based on your interests, preferences and attributes. To opt out of this and other interest-based advertising, please visit the industry opt-out pages operated by the DAA at http://www.aboutads.info and by the NAI at http://networkadvertising.org.
Like most Internet sites, we track the total number of visitors using different sections and pages on our Web site. Occasionally we also invite our users to anonymously share certain personal information about themselves — such as their age, income levels, hobbies and the like. In both cases, we aggregate this information and use it to gain a better understanding of our users’ interests, and to improve the quality of our sites. We also share this aggregate information with advertisers, to help them gain a better understanding of the demographics of our audience.
Users also should be aware when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on HomeTips bulletin boards, comments, postings, or forums, that this information can be collected and used by third parties. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond our control.
Opt-out information
If you receive any mailing from us and no longer wish to receive such a mailing you can either follow the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each of our newsletters or send us an e-mail to admin[@]hometips.com. Please include the words “Unsubscribe from Newsletter” in the subject line to help us handle your requests as quickly as possible.
If you have shared your name and postal mailing address with us but do not wish to receive future mailings from us or our marketing partners in the future, please tell us. We will remove your name from our files.
To do so:
* Send an e-mail to this address: admin[@]hometips.com.
Please include your name and complete mailing address so we can remove you from our databases;
* Or send us a letter to this address: HomeTips, 3715 Market St.,Ste. 205, Glendale, CA, 91208. Please include your name and complete mailing address so we can remove you from our databases.
You also can use the above addresses should you have any questions about our privacy policy.

Your rights

Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
8.2    Your principal rights under data protection law are:
(a)    the right to access;

(c)    the right to erasure;
(d)    the right to restrict processing;
(e)    the right to object to processing;
(f)    the right to data portability;
(g)    the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
(h)    the right to withdraw consent.
8.3    You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.
8.4    You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.
8.5    In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: [the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed]. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
8.6    In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.
8.7    You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
8.8    You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
8.9    You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.
8.10  To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:
(a)    consent; or
(b)    that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
8.12  To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
8.13  You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.
