These API Terms of Use are a binding agreement between Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. ("Blizzard") and You.  BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT", YOU (A) EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THESE API TERMS OF USE AND UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN; (B) EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS; (C) GRANT BLIZZARD THE RIGHTS SET FORTH HEREIN, AND (D) REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO FORM A BINDING CONTRACT. IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTING AN ENTITY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE API TERMS OF USE ON BEHALF OF SUCH ENTITY.  IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THESE API TERMS OF USE, YOU ARE NOT GRANTED A LICENSE AND MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE BLIZZARD DEVELOPER API, THE DATA OR THE DEVELOPER SITE.
1. Blizzard Developer APIs. The Blizzard Developer APIs are a group of application programming interfaces ("Blizzard Developer APIs") created by or on behalf of Blizzard which allow licensees to retrieve certain data regarding Blizzard's customers, Blizzard and/or certain of Blizzard's games available through Blizzard ("Data") with the use of an alpha numeric key ("API Key") provided to You by Blizzard.  Blizzard makes the Blizzard Developer APIs available for free to qualified licensees subject to the following obligations, terms and conditions, including Blizzard's right to limit, suspend or terminate any or all of the Blizzard Developer APIs entirely or Your access to them and/or to the website located at dev.battle.net ("Developer Site") at any time and without notice.
2. API and Data License. Subject to Your strict adherence to these API Terms of Use, Blizzard grants You a limited, non-exclusive, royalty free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable right and license for Your use of the Blizzard Developer API Key solely to access the Blizzard Developer APIs, implement the Blizzard Developer APIs in conjunction with Your client libraries, desktop applications, services and daemons such as websites and web services, scripts and applications and/or utilities that You register when You request an API Key("Application(s)"), and distribute the Data to players for their personal use via Your Application. You may not use the API Key or the Data for any Applications that have not been registered with Blizzard or for any other purpose.  Also, although this license is free for You to use at this time, Blizzard reserves the right to charge a fee for their use in the future. This license is subject to the following restrictions:
a. Applications may not charge premiums to use the APIs. "Premium" versions of Applications offering additional for-pay features are not permitted, nor can players be charged money to download an Application, charged for services related to the Application, or otherwise be required to offer some form of monetary compensation to download or access an Application when those features use the APIs. Applications may not include interstitials soliciting donations before features or functionality becomes available to the player.
b. Applications may not contain offensive material. Applications may not be associated with nor contain any content that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, as determined by Blizzard in Blizzard's sole discretion. Applications should only contain content appropriate for the ESRB rating for the related game(s).  For example, World of Warcraft has been rated "T for Teen" by the ESRB, and has received similar ratings from other ratings boards around the world and any Application using or displaying Data related to World of Warcraft shall be suitable for a "T for Teen" audience.
c. Applications must not negatively impact Blizzard games, services, or other players. Applications must perform no function which, in Blizzard's sole discretion, negatively impacts the performance of Blizzard games or services, or otherwise negatively affects the game for other players.
d. Applications may not target users under 13 years of age. Applications should not be designed for nor marketed to users under the age of 13 years of age.
e. You are the one responsible for Your Application. You are fully responsible and liable for all activities that occur using Your API Key and Your Application, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by You or a third party.
f. You may not use the Blizzard Developer APIs or Data for marketing or monetization purposes. You may not use the Blizzard Developer APIs or Data to market or promote Your or a third party's products or services. You may not display or reference the Data in any advertising or promotion or use the Data to target any advertising or promotion. You may not sell, license or otherwise transfer any Data (including anonymous, aggregate or derived data) to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.
g. You may not sell or license the Data to any party. The Data is for Your use to enhance the experience of the players of Blizzard's games and You are not allowed to sell, license or otherwise transfer the Data to any third party.
h. You may not integrate the Data into a physical product. The Data should be dynamically available to the public and should not be integrated into any physical product.  Doing so could prevent or hinder the deletion of the Data should Blizzard or a user so request.
i. The Blizzard Developer APIs and Data are provided "as is". You understand and agree that the Blizzard Developer APIs, the Data, the Developer Site are being provided "as is" and Blizzard makes no guarantee of the availability of any data, functionality, or feature provided by or through the Blizzard Developer APIs or Developer Site and is not required to provide any technical or other support services to You or any user of any Application. In addition, Blizzard may at any time revoke access to the Blizzard Developer API or Developer Site or disable part or all of any API or the Developer Site without any warning or notice.
j. Keep Your API Key Confidential. You shall keep Your API Key confidential, and not share it with any third party. You may not sell, sublicense or otherwise transfer or disclose Your API Key to any other party. You agree to notify Blizzard immediately if You believe that Your API Key has been compromised and You agree that You will be responsible for the use of Your API Key.
k. Blizzard is the source of the Data, but does not endorse Applications. You shall clearly and conspicuously identify Blizzard in Your Application as the source of the Data, and You shall do it in such a way which makes it not appear that Blizzard is endorsing or affiliated with Your Application.  Additionally, Your Application shall not contain any of Blizzard's trademarks as a part of its title or URL.
l. Do not reverse engineer or interfere with the Blizzard Developer APIs. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Blizzard Developer API, or otherwise attempt to derive source code, trade secrets or know-how in any Blizzard Developer API; or interfere with, modify, disrupt or disable features or functionality of any Blizzard Developer API, including without limitation any means used to circumvent any software protection or monitoring mechanisms of the Blizzard Developer APIs;
m. You must protect the Data. You must use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of the Data.  If You determine or have reason to believe that the Data has been accessed, disclosed or otherwise leaked to any unauthorized party, You must immediately notify Blizzard within 24 hours of all circumstances related to the unauthorized access, disclosure or leak, and cooperate fully with Blizzard in rectifying the breach.
n. You must have a Privacy Policy. You will post a privacy policy governing the use of the Data, which shall be consistent with Blizzard's privacy policy.
i) The privacy policy shall provide that the Data is provided to players on an "as is" basis consistent with the disclaimers in Section 7;
ii) You shall not collect, use, store or disclose any player's personal information or data in any manner that violates applicable laws, rules or regulations. If You do collect, use or store any player's personal information, You must inform them of such use and that it is subject to Your privacy policy;
iii) You shall not collect, store or otherwise intercept a player's Blizzard password; and
 
o. You may not data mine Blizzard. Except as permitted through use of the Blizzard Developer APIs, You will not perform any data-mining, scraping, crawling, or use any robot, other automatic processes that send automated queries to Blizzard or any Blizzard game, or use any other similar methods or tools to gather or extract data other information from Blizzard or any Blizzard game.
p. You may not use the Blizzard Developer APIs excessively. You are limited to thirty six thousand (36,000) calls to the Blizzard Developer API per hour or such other limitation as Blizzard may deem appropriate.  If You exceed this limitation or otherwise operate the Application in a manner that degrades the performance of the Blizzard Developer APIs, Blizzard or Blizzard's games, Blizzard may suspend or terminate Your access to the Blizzard Developer APIs.  You may not use other third-party services to make additional requests on Your behalf.
3. Your License to Blizzard. You grant Blizzard a non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty free right and license to use the Application and to distribute and publicly display it and the Data compiled and arranged by it.  You also grant Blizzard the right to monitor or collect data related to Your use of the Blizzard Developer API to ensure Your compliance with these API Terms of Use and to use as Blizzard may otherwise deem appropriate.
4. Independent Contractors. You and Blizzard are independent contractors, and nothing in these API Terms of Use shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture. While You may publicly refer to the fact that You have implemented the Blizzard Developer APIs, You agree not to make any other public statements that assert or imply any other relationship with Blizzard, unless You have Blizzard's prior written approval.

You represent and warrant to Blizzard that: (a) You have the power and authority to enter into and carry out this agreement regarding these API Terms of Use; (b) if You are entering into these API Terms of Use on behalf of an entity, You have the power and authority to cause such entity to enter into this agreement regarding these API Terms of Use; (c) the information You provided in Registering on the Developer Site is true and correct; (d) Your Application does not and will not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party; and (e) Your Applications comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
