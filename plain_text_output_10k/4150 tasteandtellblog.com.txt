Online adverts for Tello
In our efforts to match our products with the people interested in them, we use advertising services belonging to third party vendors, such as Google. Your visit on our website is likely to be a result of this third party service provided to us (AdWords, DoubleClick, etc), as well as a source to be exposed to future ads based on your past visits and interests. To opt out the use of cookies you should visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page .
Our presence across the Internet is the outcome of this matching of users' preference and products available. In order to reach the right audience, the external companies we collaborate with (like Google or Quantcast) may use certain information to establish consumers' habits: visits to a website, goods and services to determine or predict our visitors' characteristics, behavior, or preferences.
Data collected from visits to our websites is matched by external companies to larger pools of data (from more websites) to deliver ads to people with similar browsing pattern to our visitors. Thus, consumers receive more relevant ads and advertisers benefit from more effective advertising.
Such data collected DOES NOT INCLUDE our visitor's name, address, email address, telephone number. More information on how Google stores such data in the user's browser (using a "cookie") can be found here .
Our Site includes links to other web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Tello. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
Our web site also includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
If you have given your consent, we will use the data you provide us to notify you of offers or products that may be of interest to you, but at no time will we provide your data to third parties for their own direct marketing activities.
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at customerservice@tello.com.
