Sharing of Information
Sharing with Partners
When we share personal information with certain third-party partners,               including marketing and advertising partners, that information includes               your name, email address and other information enabling partners to:
assist you in using our products and services,
contact you with offers, services or products that may be of interest                 to you, and
provide you with their products or services.
If you are located in a jurisdiction where such sharing requires your               permission, we will only do so with your consent. Please note that if you               access our services through a tool that hides your location, such as               through a virtual private network, you may not receive our request for               permission because we were not able to identify you as being located in a               jurisdiction where your permission is required.
Further, our partners are prohibited from using your contact information               for any purpose beyond those set forth above without your consent. We will               not provide our partners with your credit card information.
Sharing with Third Party Service               Providers and Vendors
Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third               parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing               you with customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to               advertising assets and providing us with information technology and storage               services) or to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities               (including providing us with analytic information and search engine               optimization services). Our contracts with such third               parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any               purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.
We also share non-personal information with certain third parties,               including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising               partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners. For example,               we disclose mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign               best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked               on, our websites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.
Corporate Reorganizations
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a               substantial portion of our assets, or other similar sale transaction, your               information will be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify               you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transfer               and any choices you may have regarding your information.
Authorized Users
All users authorized by you to have access to your account can view               personal information stored in the account. A primary account holder can               view personal information saved in subaccounts to which they have               authorized access. We share information about authorized users only for               legitimate purposes consistent with this privacy policy, including               servicing your account and marketing products and services to you.
Legal Process
Lastly, if legally required to do so, or if we have a good faith belief               that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, we may disclose your personal               information to courts of law, law enforcement authorities and other               relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, to conduct an               investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or               court order, bring legal action, prevent harm to others or pursue other               relief when you or a third party are or may be:
violating our terms and conditions of use;
causing injury or other harm to, or otherwise violating the property                 or other legal rights, of us, other users, or third parties; or
violating federal, state, local, or other applicable law.
This disclosure can include transferring your information to               other outside the European Economic Area. To the extent we               are legally permitted to do so, it is our policy to notify you in the event               that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties               in connection with a subpoena.
Security
The transmission of information via the internet, email or text message               is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your               personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information               transmitted through the Services or over email; any transmission is at your               own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate               technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal               information against loss, theft and unauthorized use, access or               modification.
When we collect financial account information, such as credit card               numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as               the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Portability
You have the right to receive a subset of the personal information you               provide us if we process it on the legal bases of our contract with you or               with your consent in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable               format and a right to request that we transfer such personal information to               another party. If you wish for us to transfer the personal information to               another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can               only do so where it is technically feasible.

Please note that while               we assess whether the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate               or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of               the applicable data as described below.

You believe the personal information is not accurate for the period                 it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate;

You have objected to us processing personal information we hold about                 you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop                 processing the personal information while we determine whether there is                 an overriding interest in us retaining such personal information.
Objection
You have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we               will consider your request. Please provide us with detail as to your               reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding               interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in               relation to legal claims.
You also have the right, at any time, to object to our processing of               data about you in order to send you marketing, including where we build               profiles for such purposes and we will stop processing the data for that               purpose.
Third Party Links and Information Collection and               Use by Our Users
Some of our Services provide links to other websites. Because we do not               control the information policies or practices of these third party sites,               you should review their privacy policies to learn about how they collect               and use personal information.
You may also log in to some of our Services using sign-in services such               as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will               authenticate your identity and provide you with the option to share certain               personal information with us, such as your name and email address to               pre-populate our sign up form. For example, if you take advantage of               certain of our social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and               widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that               run on our site, the applicable social networking sites may collect your IP               address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie               to enable it to function properly.

If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with               personal information, we will delete such information from our files.
