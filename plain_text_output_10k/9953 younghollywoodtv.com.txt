This notice outlines the privacy policies of the Sites. By visiting this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. Since any changes will be posted on this page, we encourage you to check this page regularly. Your continued use of the Sites following any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such changes.
Your IP Address
Each time you visit the Sites, our web server automatically recognizes your IP address and the Web page from which you came. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Sites, and to better serve you in using the services and features of the Sites.
Cookies and Action Tags
The first time a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at a Site, we assign an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to a Site using the same PC, the cookie allows the Site to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on a Site (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), we may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in our user database. We may use the information stored in our database (i) for the purpose for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or offers in the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same ads, offers and promotions while visiting Sites; and (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements historically, or likely to be, of interest to that user.
Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on a site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. We may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Sites and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased.

We share your Information with third parties as listed below and as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy:
Service Providers
We employ and allow third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, advertising, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services.

Business Transfers
We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer Information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred.

You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately. To help protect your Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.
We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
6. WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELD

It may also be processed by any service providers appointed by us who operate outside of the EEA and their staff. By submitting your data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA or your country and acknowledge that not all countries guarantee the same level of protection for your Information as the one in which you reside. Data transferred will be treated in accordance with this Policy and, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation.
7. EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS OR RESIDENTS
On May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect. All natural persons whose personal data is processed by Young Hollywood LLC within the territorial scope of the GDPR, are Data Subjects and entitled to certain rights. Depending on your location, we may provide you with the ability to access, download, and request deletion of your personal information. Weâve updated our Privacy Policy to take into account the new requirements of the GDPR.
If you are a Data subject in the European Union, you have the following rights under GDPR, subject to certain exceptions:
Right of Access: You have the right to know whether personal data concerning you is being processed, and if so, the purpose of the processing, categories of data concerned, recipients to whom the data are disclosed and the legal basis for processing the personal data.
Right of Rectification or Erasure- âRight to be Forgottenâ: When Young Hollywood LLC holds personal data about you that is inaccurate, incomplete or no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, you have the right to ask Young Hollywood LLCÂ  to rectify, complete, or erase the personal data.
Right to Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict processing of your personal data by asking Young Hollywood LLCÂ  to limit what we do with it.
Right to Data Portability: You have the right to certain personal information Young Hollywood LLCÂ  stores about you in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format for transfer to a third party of your choosing;
Right to Object to Automated decision-making: You have the right not to be subject to automated decision making where this has legal or other significant consequences, except where you have explicitly consented to this or where it is necessary for entering into or performing a contract.
Right to Withdraw Consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent allowing Young Hollywood LLCÂ  to process your information at any time and prevent the processing of their data for direct electronic marketing purposes.
Exceptions: You can object to processing of your personal data under certain circumstances, unless there is a legitimate ground for processing the personal data, where you have explicitly granted consent, where it is necessary for entering into or performing a contract, or where Young Hollywood LLC needs to process the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
.
8. LAWFUL BASES FOR PROCESSING
We will only collect and process Information about you where we have lawful bases. Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested)) and âlegitimate interestsâ.
Where we process Information based on consent, we will ask for your explicit consent. You may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal.
Where we rely on contract, we will ask that you agree to the processing of personal data that is necessary for entering into or performance of your contract with us. We provide a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use , which set out the contract between the Company and you. As we operate in countries worldwide (including the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we may need to transfer your Information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services.
Where we rely on legitimate interests as a basis for Information processing, you have the right to object. We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests or for the legitimate interests of third parties, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal Information to:
Protect you, us, or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud)
Comply with laws that apply to us
Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service
Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions

We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.
