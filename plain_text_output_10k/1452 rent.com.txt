When using our Sites, we will collect and store your information. In most cases, the information we hold about you is collected through the Sites, but we may also collect information from private-label, co-branded and affiliate websites and/or from third parties with whom we have entered into an arrangement for such collection, or from their respective tools, applications or services ("Other Sites"). We may also collect information about you from other means and sources as described herein. Accordingly, our privacy policy may apply to you even if you do not submit information to us through the Sites. Depending on the services you use, we may collect and store the following information:

information based on your interactions with the Sites or Other Sites and their advertising, such as search information, device sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to, from and within the Sites or Other Sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information;

We reserve the right to use and disclose in any manner, any non-personal, non-identifiable information, including in the form of aggregated data, that we collect by use of cookies and traffic data, or that you share with us through the Sites.
In addition, we may provide or share some or all of your personal information, including email addresses, to:
Law enforcement offices, third-party rights owners or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.

Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, invoicing, telecommunication and call monitoring services).
Another business entity should we plan to merge with, or sell substantially all our assets to that business entity.
Logs, recordings, and other information related to communication between you and third parties in connection with the services and/or other uses and purposes mentioned herein may be stored, maintained and/or divulged to those third parties by us on an individual basis or in the aggregate.
When you contact a property, they will store information about you, such as your name, email address, phone number, etc. We expect properties to use your information solely for the purpose of your interaction with them as a renter; however, we have no control over how a given property will use your information.
Communications and Communication Tools.
We communicate with users, and facilitate communications between users, in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:
Property Contact Form. We make tools available that facilitate communications between renters and properties by phone, email or text. When these tools are used, we may collect certain information related to the communication, like email addresses, contact logs, calling number, call duration, contents of the email communication, and call recordings. We may share this information with properties so they can manage their communications with renters.
Send-to-a-Friend. If you use our Send-to-a-Friend or other email tools, we do not permanently store the email address you give us or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.
Email preferences. We provide all users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related) communications from us. To remove your contact information from Rent.com lists and newsletters, click on the "unsubscribe" link that is included at the bottom of any Rent.com email you receive.
Cookies.
We or our service providers may place cookies or web beacons on your device when you visit our Sites. We use permanent cookies to provide personalized features, such as automatically logging you into your personalized home page and to deliver customized services, content, and advertising. We use session cookies to monitor and improve the functionality and usability of the Sites. You can block our cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you.
We may use data management platforms and third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our and our advertising partners' behalf. These companies may employ cookies, clear gifs, web beacons or similar technologies to deliver advertising and measure its effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is completely anonymous.
Opting Out of Collection of Information by our Service Providers.
As noted above, we or our service providers (e.g., data management platforms, third-party ad servers, ad network providers, or third-party advertisers) may provide you with advertisements that you see on the Sites or other websites. To help deliver these advertisements and improve the overall consumer experience, we or our service providers may employ cookies, clear gifs, web beacons or similar technologies. These technologies may record your activity, and are helpful to understand what types of information or advertisements are most useful for a user. To learn more about your ability to opt out of certain of these technologies and for other information, please visit, the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative .
Renters, Properties, External Websites and Other Third Parties.
Except as otherwise expressly included herein, this Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are renters, properties or other websites, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
The Sites have links to other websites that may collect personal information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.
Account Protection.
Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your Rent.com password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify Rent.com and change your password.
Security.
Your information (other than credit card information) is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from Rent.com. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.
Minors.
The Sites are intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Sites or other services, or contribute any information to us.
Notice to California Residents.
If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@rentpath.com .
General.
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on Rent.com. Amended terms take effect upon acceptance for new users and 10 days after they are posted on Rent.com for all other users. Your continued use of the Sites constitutes acceptance of any new terms.
