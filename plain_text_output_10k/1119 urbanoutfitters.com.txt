We collect information such as your name, e-mail and postal address and credit card numbers, that you provide to us when you place an order, when you save your information with us or when you participate in a sweepstakes, promotion or survey. UrbanOutfitters.com may use your information collected online to process and fulfill your order. We also collect e-mail addresses at various locations within the site including when you order from the site so that we can send you any necessary e-mail messages related to your order — such as an order confirmation notice, as well as send you other information that we believe may be of interest to you. In addition, we maintain a record of your product interests, purchases and whatever else might enable us to enhance and personalize your shopping experience.

Our retail locations are equipped with video monitoring for security purposes, so we may capture your video image in public areas while you are shopping with us. Our retail locations may also be equipped with iBeacons and Wi-Fi. An iBeacon is a device that transmits signals that can be used to detect your mobile device when you are in close proximity to the iBeacon. In addition, if your Wi-Fi is activated on your mobile device, we may detect your device and collect limited external signals sent by your device, such as the Media Access Control (MAC) address associated with your device. We use these technologies to learn about the customer shopping experience in our retail locations, including which areas of the store our customers visit, how long they spend in certain areas, general traffic patterns, the customer experience at the point of sale, and how frequently customers visit our stores. We use this information to improve the shopping experience for our customers. We also use this information to provide offers and promotions that we think may be of interest to our customers which may at times be customized depending on where the customer is in the store. We do not read or in any way access your contacts, pictures, the messages you send or receive on your device, or any data that you enter into or create on your device. You may withdraw your consent to receiving offers and promotions at any time. We use third party service providers to assist us with these technologies. You may opt out of connectivity with our iBeacons by turning off the Bluetooth on your device, adjusting your device settings for your mobile applications to prevent the use of Bluetooth. You may opt out of the collection of information by Wi-Fi by turning off the wireless functionality on your device or visiting www.axper.com/privacy/ .Where required by law, notices are posted at the retail locations if we are collecting video, using iBeacons or collecting information from your Wi-Fi enabled mobile device. Only authorized personnel are permitted to review the video and any data we collect from your device broadcasts. We retain images and data only for as long as they are required to fulfill the purposes for which we collected them.
