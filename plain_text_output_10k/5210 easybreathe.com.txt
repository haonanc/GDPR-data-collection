Functional Cookies
These cookies customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Applications and remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get. So when you use our Applications, we remember you and your preferences and information you have submitted to us to provide you with a customised experience. For example, remembering your 'home city'.
Performance and Analytics
Performance cookies let us collect information about how you use the Applications.  They collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Applications (including how long you spend on the Applications) and where you have come to the Applications from, so that we can improve the Applications and learn which functions of the Applications are most popular with users. This information does not include Personal Information although we might be able to associate such information with user accounts once we receive it from the third party.
Advertising and Targeting
These cookies collect information about the pages you visit online.  They gather information about the pages that you visit or the functions of the Applications you use, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address or unique device identifier that you are using (the applicable cookie identifier) and also can include information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider.  This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements on the Applications which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. This may result in you seeing adverts for our Applications when you visit other websites.
