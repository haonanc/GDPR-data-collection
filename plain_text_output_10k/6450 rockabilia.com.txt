The privacy practices of this statement apply only to the Rockabilia website. Please review the privacy policy of other websites that may be linked to this website as they may have their own privacy policy that differ from our own.

We collect information through cookies and other automated means. Cookies are commonly used by websites to save data on your computer. The information we collect from cookies may include your IP address, browser and device characteristics, referring URLs, and a record of your interactions with our website. We use cookies to create a more personalized shopping experience on our website. 
We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on our site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address. 
"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. 
Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a vendor, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. 
In combination with other information we collect, a cookie may facilitate the tailoring of advertisements and offers to you, sometimes in connection with interest-based advertising. 
To help us understand and enhance our interactions with visitors to our website, we may permit web analytics providers to collect information on our website using automated tools like cookies or web beacons. Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the website has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the website, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon. We also may share personal information with those providers.

Legal Requests
Rockabilia cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your User ID, name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to Rockabilia participants as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.
Control of Your Password
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, if any, including the payment of fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your Rockabilia User ID or password, if any, to any third parties. If you choose to share your User ID and password, if any, or your information with third parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, if any, and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, if any, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
Reviewing and Changing Your Personally Identifiable Information
Following registration, you can review and change the information you submitted during registration including: 
Your User ID and email address.
Your registration information such as: name, company, address, city, state, zip code, country, primary phone number, secondary phone number, fax number and gender.
Your password, if one is required.
You must promptly update your information if it changes. 
Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in social media or other message areas or the feedback areas. Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, and financial information from our active databases. To make this request, fill out the support form on our customer service page. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law. 
We will retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Conditions of Use Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests.

We use third-party advertising companies to display ads when you visit our website or other sites on the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to this and other websites. We may also share personal information with these companies. In either case, the purpose is to provide ads about products and services that may be of interest to you.
Protecting Children's Privacy
We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.
Links to Other Websites
Our websites link to other websites, many of which have their own privacy policies. Be sure to review the privacy policy on the site you're visiting.
Privacy Policy Updates
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. All changes to this policy are effective after we post the changes to this page.
Security
Rockabilia uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. Rockabilia treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.
