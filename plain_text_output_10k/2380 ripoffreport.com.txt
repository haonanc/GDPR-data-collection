Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to the Ripoff Report web site. Our contact information is:
Xcentric Ventures, LLC
GENERAL INTRODUCTORY INFORMATION
We respect your privacy. This is why we have taken the time to disclose our information collection practices and our privacy policy. Please take the time to review this document. It is important that you understand how we do things around here, and, if you don't agree with these practices, do not use the website, register for a user account, nor sign up for any related emails, etc. It's that simple.
Protecting your private information is our priority. This Statement of Privacy applies to the website RipoffReport.com and RipoffReportLegalDirectory.com (collectively "Ripoff Report") and governs data collection and usage of such data. By using Ripoff Report you consent to the data practices described in this statement.
PURPOSES FOR COLLECTING INFORMATION
Collecting information provides not only benefits to us as we figure out new services and develop best practices for the site but also specific benefits to our website visitors and by providing this information, our staff or authorized third-parties as outlined in our Terms of Service can contact you regarding your post or otherwise follow-up if necessary. The following are reasons that we may collect and maintain your data:
Verifying Reports as such circumstances or need may arise – Ripoff Report doesn't verify the accuracy of any post nor the legitimacy of any particular author. Please see our Terms of Service for more information.
Providing advertising information for products and services that may be of interest to you.
Sending you emails that may pertain to your rights (such as information regarding a subpoena for your identifying author information) or to provide you information about news, scams, tips, resources, etc.
Website and system administration.
Research and development.
Preserving social history as governed by existing US law or policy (archiving information in the public interest).
Users filing a Report or Rebuttal may opt-in if they would be willing to be contacted by the media, a consumer advocate, or lawyer to help further their cause or to help with an investigation against a business or an individual. Government agencies may contact you as well for similar purposes, however, as per our Terms of Service, providing such agencies your information is at Xcentric's discretion.
WHO HAS ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
The short answer is certain employees of Xcentric and limited third-party vendors or associates utilized by or connected to Xcentric. Unless you opt-in as mentioned above or as otherwise outlined in our Terms of Service in the section relating to the "Disclosure of Information Supplied by You" which includes our assisting government agencies or other ways that you may lose anonymity privileges, we keep the information within the company. At the same time, third-party vendors hired by Xcentric to assist with administration or maintenance of website systems and/or communications systems may be provided with access to databases and storage that contain such information as deemed necessary by Xcentric. Similarly, we may engage third-party associates to provide you information and products that you may be interested in.
Of the information we do collect, outside of a display name or information that you publish to the public via writing a post, or unless otherwise stated herein or as explained in our Terms of Service, we do not provide our visitors with access to information we collect. People cannot just email us and ask for your information – it doesn't work like that. We might, however, email you on a third-party's behalf. For example, there may be a situation where other consumers are trying to get in touch with other victims.
