We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding     the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at     www.SmartAsset.com (the "Site") and related services (collectively, "Services").
1. USER CONSENT. By submitting Personal Data through our website, Products, or related      services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the     processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
2. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors     who are under the age of 13.
3. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. Your Personal Data may be     processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United     States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws     in your country. BY USING OUR SITE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL DATA THROUGH         OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR         PERSONAL DATA ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
4. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT. Company collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data      from you when you visit our site, when you send us information or communications, and/or     when you download and use our Products. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to     identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail     address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to     any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked     to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons.     We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.
Personal Data You Provide to Us. We collect Personal Data from you, such as your email         address when you provide it voluntarily on the Site. If you provide us feedback or     contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our     website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content     included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit     to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect     additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our     website, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and     other users will be able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you     provide to us voluntarily, such as your Twitter name or Facebook profile. We may     also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information from you via the Products     or at other points in our website that state that Personal Data is being collected.
Personal Data Collected via Technology. To make our Site, products, and related services     more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider)     collect Personal Data from you, including your IP address or HTTP referrer. We     also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource     Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the     solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most     Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each      time you visit our website or access your account on our network. "Cookies" are small     pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are     viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close     your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete     them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.     Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If     you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.      We have also enabled Google Analytics features, including Demographics and Interest Reporting     to gather demographic information provided by these features. You can opt-out of Google     Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads by changing     your Google Ads Settings.
SmartAsset is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory program and adheres to the DAA         self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. We work with a variety of advertisers, ad networks         and analytics companies (“Ad Partners”) that collect information about your use of our services.         You can opt out of the use of interest-based advertising at any time by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance consumer choice page.
Our Relationship with Social Networking Sites. We have created, and may offer You,     interfaces that allow You to connect with social networking websites such as Facebook     and Twitter ("SN Sites") through our Site. We will work with the SN Site's application     protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows You     to authorize us to access Your account on that SN Site on Your behalf. In order to     provide this authorization, You will not provide us with Your user name or password     to the SN Site, but You will need to log-in to that SN Site directly through our Site.     Once authorized by You, the SN Site will provide us a token that allows the SN Site to     recognize us when we ask, on Your behalf, for access to Your account information or     to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any SN Site at any time by     amending the appropriate settings from within Your account settings on the applicable     SN Site, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide You.
5. USE OF YOUR DATA.

Creation of Anonymous Data. We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data     by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable     to you. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that     we may enhance the content of our Products and services and improve site navigation.     Company reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to Third Party     Companies in its discretion.

6. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA.
Affiliates. Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint     ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, "Affiliates"),     we may in the future. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with these     Affiliates, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.     If another company acquires Company or our assets, that company will possess the     Personal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding     your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
Other Disclosures. Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as     described below), Company may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith     that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to     subpoenas or warrants served on Company; or (b) protect or defend the rights or     property of Company or users of the Products or related services.

We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from other sources like telephone     or fax, or from companies that provide our products or services by way of a co-branded     or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our     website ("Third Party Companies"). Our Third Party Companies may supply us with     Personal Data, such as your email address, in order to help us establish the account.     We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via     our website in order to improve the products and services we provide.
Our provision of a link to any other website or location, such as the payment processing     websites, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other     website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our     site and go to another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Data     or Anonymous Data from you.
We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or     their content.

You expressly consent to the     sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and other service providers for the     sole purpose of providing services to you.
Disclosure to Third Party Companies. We may enter into agreements with Third Party     Companies. A Third Party Company may want access to Personal Data that we collect     from its customers. As a result, we may disclose your Personal Data to a Third Party     Company. The privacy policies of our Third Party Companies may apply to the     use and disclosure of your Personal Data that we collect and disclose to such Third     Party Companies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of our Third Party     Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.
