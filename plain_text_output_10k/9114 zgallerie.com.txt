Z Gallerie is  committed to protecting your privacy. This policy applies to information  collected on zgallerie.com, computerized devices, in our stores, and through  any location where the policy is posted (collectively referred to herein as  "Sites”) and applies to data collection by Z Gallerie and/or its  subsidiary and affiliated entities. BY VISITING OUR SITES, YOU CONSENT TO THE  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF  INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW.
We firmly believe the  continued success of the Internet is dependent on security and privacy. In  support of this, we will use the personal information you provide in accordance  with the terms outlined below.
Information  We Gather
We collect two types  of information from visitors to our Sites: (1) Personally Identifiable  Information; and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address  or cookies.
(A) Personally  Identifiable Information
"Personally  Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you, such as your  name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name. Some examples  in which we may collect and store your personally identifiable information on  our Sites:
We may collect your email address if you sign up to receive  email updates from us or contact us with a question;
We may collect your name, company name, business license number,  address, phone number, email address, and social media information if you apply  to participate in our Designer Trade Program;
We may collect your name, address, email address, credit card  and billing information if you make a purchase of a product;
We may collect your name and address if you request a catalog  from us;
We may collect your name, address, and email address if you  create a registry or other account on our Sites; and
We may collect your  name, date of birth, and email address if you choose to participate in a  contest or sweepstakes.
The above list  provides an example of the personally identifiable information that may be  collected on our Sites.
(B) Non-Personally  Identifiable Information
"Non-Personally  Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be  demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-personally  identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. We’ve provided some  examples of the non-personally identifiable information collected via our Sites  and a description of how this information is used:
Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that  lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as  the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you  upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure  traffic.
Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be  used to collect information about your activity on the Sites. You may set most  browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block  cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the  personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Sites.
Web  Beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to  cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard  drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Demographic Information -- "Demographic Information" may  be your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provided to  us. We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to  analyze trends to ensure the information provided by our Sites meets your  needs.
Geolocation  Data --We may also collect your location if you allow us to track your location  through our Sites, or if your personally or non-personally identifiable  information indicates a certain geographic location. This information may help  us provide recommendations to you based on your location.
The above list  provides an example of the non-personally identifiable information that is  collected via our Sites. Please note that we consider aggregated information,  which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally identifiable  information. We may also tie non-personally identifiable information with  personally identifiable information in order to ensure that the Sites and our  services meet your needs. When we tie non-personally identifiable information  with personally identifiable information, it is considered “personally  identifiable information” for the purposes of this policy. That means that we  will be using and sharing this combined data in the ways described in that  section below.
Use  of Gathered Information
(A) Personally  Identifiable Information
To alert you to special offers and updated information;
To process requested commerce transactions or to contact you  regarding a specific transaction;
To fulfill the terms of a promotion;
To respond to your request or contact;
To allow you access to limited-entry areas of our Sites; and
To notify you of a  material change to this privacy policy or our other relevant terms.
(B) Non-Personally  Identifiable Information
Non-personally  identifiable information is used as described above and in other ways as  permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally identifiable  information with personally identifiable information.
Sharing  and Disclosure of Information
(A) Personally  Identifiable Information
To better serve you we  may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following  instances:
To fulfill your request. For example, if you request one of our  catalogs, we may share your information in order to fulfill your request. In  addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to respond  to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may  use it in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may  share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or with mail carriers. We  also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion.
To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers  or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we  believe may be of interest to you or who require your personally identifiable  information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes.
To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or  independent contractors who help us maintain our Sites and provide other  administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing  and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data,  sending customer communications on our behalf, and entry collection, winner  selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other  promotions).
To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase we  will share your information with unaffiliated third parties that assist us with  order fulfillment and with credit card processing.
To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and  volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such  information to third parties.
To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such  action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply  with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property,  including our rights and property and our Sites or act in urgent circumstances  to protect the personal safety of our end users.
To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process  including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or  substantially all of our assets.
To protect against  potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected  from these Sites. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally  identifiable information about you from such services. In particular, if you  use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card  authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information  and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card  has not been reported as lost or stolen.
Except as described in  this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not  otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable  information to any third parties.
(B) Non-Personally  Identifiable Information
We use non-personally  identifiable information collected on the Sites in the manner disclosed above.  We may share this non-personal information with third parties.
Minors
Protecting the privacy  of children is extremely important to Z Gallerie. Our Sites are directed toward  a general audience and are not directed at nor intended for use by children. We  do not knowingly collect or intend to collect personally identifiable  information from anyone who is under the age of 13. If you are under the age of  13, you should not provide personal information to anyone. We encourage parents  and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help  enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide  personally identifiable information through our Sites. If you have reason to  believe a child under the age of 13 has provided personally identifiable  information to us, please contact us and we will delete their information from  our databases.
International  Transfer of Information
If you choose to  provide us with personally identifiable information, we may transfer that information  to affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and  from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around  the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with  laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law,  please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information  to the US which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by  providing your personally identifiable information you consent to:
the use of your personally identifiable information as identified  above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and
the  transfer of your personally identifiable information to the United States as  indicated above.
Opt-Out
We communicate with  our customers and those individuals who subscribe to our services on a regular  basis via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your  request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes  to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as  required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but  they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
However, we provide  you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive  other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us  regarding new services and products offered on the Sites or if you do not want  us to share your personally identifiable information with third parties. The  opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box if  such checkbox is available at the points where personally identifiable  information is collected or by contacting us. We will process your unsubscribe  as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may  receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. You also may  opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link  within the text of the email. Additionally, we support and adhere to the  guidelines and practices adopted by the Direct Marketing Association's Privacy  Promise to American Consumers. We have agreed to (1) provide customers with  notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale, or exchange  with other marketers; (2) honor customers' requests not to share their contact  information with other marketers; and (3) honor customers' requests not to  receive mail, telephone, or other solicitations from Z Gallerie.
Forums,  Chat Rooms and Other Public Posting Areas
Please note that any  information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other  public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't  want people to know your e-mail address, for example, please don't include it  in any message you post publicly. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS  OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC  POSTING AREAS.
Third  Party Web Sites
This statement applies  solely to information collected on our Sites. Our Sites may contain links to  other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the  content of these other web sites.
Third  Party Advertisers
We may use  advertisers, third party ad networks, and other advertising companies, to serve  advertisements on the Sites. Please be advised that such advertising companies  may gather information about your visit to the Sites or other sites (such as  through cookies, web beacons and other technologies) to enable such advertising  companies to market products or services to you, to monitor which ads have been  served to your browser and which webpages you were viewing when such ads were  delivered. If you would like more information about this practice and to know  your choices please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS  POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH ADVERTISING  COMPANIES.
Online  Tracking
We do not support Do  Not Track browser settings and do not currently participate in any "Do Not  Track" frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals or other  mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your personally identifiable  information or non-personally identifiable information.
Passwords
Your  account information and access to certain areas of our Sites are sometimes  accessible only through the use of an individual user ID and password. To  protect your confidentiality, you must keep your password confidential and not  disclose it to any other person. Please advise us immediately if you believe  the confidentiality of your password has been compromised or your password has  been misused. In addition, always log out and close your browser when you  finish your session. Please note we will never ask you to disclose your  password in an unsolicited phone call or email.
Accessing  Your Personally Identifiable Information and Privacy Preferences
We provide you with an  opportunity to access your personal information to ensure it is correct,  accurate and current. You may update your information by accessing your  account, if you have an account with us. Alternatively, you may contact our  customer service representatives at (800) 908-6748 or customerservice@zgallerie.com
Assignment
In the event that all  or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of  a merger, you grant us the right to assign the personally identifiable and  non-personally identifiable information collected via our Sites.
Changes  to this Privacy Policy
We reserve the right  to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will also  revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this privacy policy.  For changes to this privacy policy that may be materially less restrictive on  our use or disclosure of personally identifiable information you have provided  to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change by  sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by  placing a prominent notice on our Sites.
Security
We consider the  confidentiality and security of your information to be paramount. We use  physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your  personally identifiable information secure and confidential and will not  provide it to third parties except as required by law or as otherwise provided  in our Privacy Policy. All orders are transmitted over secure Internet  connections using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology. All of your  personally identifiable information, including your credit card information and  sign-in password, are stored in an unreadable, encrypted format at all times.  Our Sites and--more importantly--all user information are further protected by  a multi-layer firewall based security system. However, the Internet is not a  secure environment, and we cannot 100% guarantee the security of your personal  information; there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way  to circumvent our security measures or that information transmitted over the  Internet may be intercepted. Protecting the security of your login information  is your responsibility. Additionally, email and other communication channels  may not be encrypted.
If we learn of a  security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you  can take appropriate protective steps. By using these Sites or providing  personally identifiable information to us you agree that we can communicate  with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues  relating to your use of these Sites. We may post a notice on our Sites if a  security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address  you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live,  you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
YOUR  CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
California Civil Code  Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request  certain information regarding our disclosure of personally identifiable  information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such  a request, please contact us at customerservice@zgallerie.com .
If you have any  questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact  us. All information you provide in any written communication will also be  covered by this policy.
