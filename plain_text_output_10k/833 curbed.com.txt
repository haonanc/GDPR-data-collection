Curb Records, Inc. (“we”) is concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we or our third-party service providers collect through certain of our owned or controlled websites and web properties (e.g., widgets and applications) and mobile applications (“ Mobile Apps”) (collectively the “Properties”). By providing Personal Information (as defined below) to us through the Properties, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information and/or other practices of any third party, including Facebook, Inc., Apple Inc., Google Inc., Microsoft Corp., Blackberry, any wireless carriers, our artists, our affiliates and any third party operating any site and/or property to which any Property contains a link. In addition, the inclusion of a link on any Property does not imply endorsement of, and/or affiliation with, the linked site and/or Property by us and/or by our artists and/or affiliates. Please note that the Properties may include the ability to access and submit (including, for example, via a third-party software application or service that is available through or in connection with a Property) certain information directly to third parties such as Facebook and/or to any application platform such as Apple’s App Store and/or Google Play. Such information is submitted by you directly to such third parties; this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information submitted by you to third parties.
Cross-Border Transfer: The Properties are controlled and operated from the United States; accordingly, this Privacy Policy, and our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information, is governed by U.S. law, and the Properties are not intended to subject us and/or any of our affiliates to the laws and/or jurisdiction of any state, country and/or territory other than that of the United States.  Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities and/or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Properties you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.
The Properties are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we instruct that such individuals do not provide Personal Information through the Properties.
Your California Privacy Rights: If you are a California resident, you may request certain information once per year about our disclosure of certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding calendar year to third parties for such third parties’ own direct marketing purposes. Please send your request by postal mail to Curb Records, Inc., 48 Music Square East, Nashville, TN 37203, Attn.: Legal Dept. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the mailing addresses specified in this section.
UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. Please take a look at the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this page to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we make the revised Privacy Policy available on or through a Property. Your use of such Property and/or your submission of any information in connection with such Property following such changes means that you accept the revised Privacy Policy.
Two types of information are collected in connection with the Properties: Personal Information and Other Information. “Personal Information” is information that identifies you as an individual. “Other Information” is any information that does not reveal your specific identity. Other Information is addressed separately below, under the heading “OTHER INFORMATION”.

OTHER INFORMATION
Other Information We May Collect
We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information (defined above), such as:
Browser and device information
Mobile App usage date
How We May Collect Other Information
We and our third-party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:
Through your browser or your device: Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, device type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version, Internet browser type and version and the type and version of a Property that you are using. We and our service providers may also collect a unique device identifier assigned by us or our service providers to the device from which you are accessing a Property and other transactional information for the device that we and our service providers may use to serve content to the device.
Through your use of Mobile Apps: When you download and use a Mobile App, we and our service providers may track and collect Mobile App usage data, such as the date and time the Mobile App on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the Mobile App based on your device number.
Through server log files: An Internet Protocol (“IP”) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your device from which you are accessing a Property by your Internet Service Provider, and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Property, along with the time of the visit and the activity on the Property. We and our service providers use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Property usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, administering the Properties and determining your approximate geographic location.
Through the use of cookies: We and our service providers may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Stored Objects [“Flash LSOs”]) and/or other similar technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information for our products and services, and for those of third parties, facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Properties, and collect and store information about your use of the Properties. For example, pixel tags and web beacons may be used in connection with a Property to, among other things, track the actions of such Property’s users, measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about such Property’s usage and response rates.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a procedure on most devices through which the Properties are accessed that allows you to decline the use of cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, then some or all of the features, functionality and promotions available through the Properties may not be available to you.  If your device stores Flash LSOs, and if you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device through which you access the Properties, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage. Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with the Properties and/or our content. We expect our service providers and technology suppliers to honor any decision by you to restrict or limit Flash LSOs, but we cannot guarantee that they will do so.
The use of these technologies allows our vendors and third-parties and their vendors to deliver advertisements about our products and services, and the products and services of others, when you use the Properties and/or other applications and/or visit websites and/or web properties across the Internet on any of your devices. These parties may place so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” and/or similar technologies on the device through which you access the Properties, and other applications or websites across the Internet, and also place and/or recognize third-party cookies when you use the Properties, and/or other applications, websites and/or web properties. They may also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop. These vendors may use information about your visits, on the different devices you use, to the Properties, and other applications, websites or web properties (excluding your name, address, and telephone number), as well as information received from third parties, to provide advertisements for us and others about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  If you would like more information about this practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative at www.networkadvertising.org or the Digital Advertising Alliance at www.aboutads.info .  You may also visit those sites to opt out of these advertising practices in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy.  Our Properties do not respond to browser-based do-not-track signals.
Through the use of location enabled products and/or services your geographic location may be obtained. When you use a location-enabled service, we may collect and process information about your precise geographical location, such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We and our third party service providers and partners may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services, content and advertisements. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such uses, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.
From you: We may collect demographic information, such as your zip code and/or gender, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication, when you voluntarily provide this information to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you and/or any other user of the Properties.  We may collect information about how you interact on the Properties. For example, some Properties may utilize analytic tools to help us better serve you through improved products, services, and revisions to the Properties. This collected information may let us know which services and features you are using the most within a Property, as well as device type and hardware features, country and language of download, etc.
By aggregating information: We may aggregate Personal Information so that the end-product does not personally identify you and/or any other user of the Properties, for example, by using Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who like a particular artist.
How We May Use and Disclose Other Information
Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it as described in “How We May Collect Other Information” section above, as well as for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
SECURITY
We seek to use reasonable physical, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and/or data security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that email communications are not always secure, so please do not include credit card information and/or other sensitive information in your email messages to us.
