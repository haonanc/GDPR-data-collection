At National Review we believe you should know what data we collect from you and how we use it. We also believe you should be able to make the best decisions about the information you share with National Review. That is the spirit behind this privacy policy.
QUICK OVERVIEW OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We encourage all users of the National Review website to read our privacy policy in full. But here’s a quick rundown of the key themes in this policy.
National Review is both a magazine and a website. We offer subscriptions to our magazine, including a digital version of our magazine that is available on our website. “Digital” subscribers need to login to our site to access the digital magazine and more. When logged in, you have full access via our  Customer Care  website to the information applied to your subscription account.
We receive personal information from you in a variety of ways. This information can come from what you give us directly, such as through a subscription, a newsletter sign-up, or a website comment. This information can also come from what you do not give us directly, such as data gathered by third parties (including advertisers) based on your browsing habits.
We use your behavior while on the National Review website to serve you additional content that you might like. In other words, we match your content selections with similar selections that you have not yet read. We hope this makes your website experience more rewarding.
You can control the information you give us. You can manage all of the personal information relative to your subscription on our  Customer Care website. You can unsubscribe from any e-mail series we send you. (You can do this directly within the e-mail.) You can opt out of targeted advertising as well (see the  Network Advertising Initiative  and  Digital Advertising Alliance ).
We encourage you to contact us at  privacy@nationalreview.com  with any questions you might have about our Privacy Policy and our practices regarding your personal information. European Union citizens may also contact privacy@nationalreview.com  to request information on personal data that is being tracked or stored. Note: National Review, Inc., does not track and/or store any personally identifiable information (PII) on non-U.S. and non-subscribed users.

GENERAL STATEMENT ABOUT DATA COLLECTION & TARGETED ADVERTISING
The National Review website permits data collection for interest-based advertising. We and third parties may use cookies, web beacons or pixels, mobile ad identifiers, and other tracking technologies to facilitate site navigation, to better understand and improve our services, and to determine or improve the advertising shown to you on this website or elsewhere.

This information may be combined with information collected across different websites, online services, and other linked or associated devices.
We and third parties may use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server.

We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, such as analyzing the use of our services and providing content and ads that are of greater relevance to you.
