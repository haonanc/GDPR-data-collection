The University will ensure that data processed or stored in University             systems hosted by third-party vendors are compliant with this Policy             and relevant laws and regulations; however, the University is not responsible             for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies             or practices of third-party service providers.
All University units are responsible for establishing and making available             for view appropriate privacy notices related to their collection, use,             distribution, and destruction of personal data.
Those University units designated as a University health care component             may use and share personal health information (PHI) across locations             to facilitate treatment, research, payment, and other healthcare operation             purposes.
Individuals have the right to:
Expect that their PII collected by the University will remain private                 and secure;

Individuals who disclose other people’s personal information to the University             or our third- party service providers, represent that they have the authority             to do so and permit us to use the information in accordance with this             Policy.

Any attempt to retaliate against a person for reporting a privacy violation                 may itself be considered a violation of this Policy and may result                 in sanctions.
The University reserves the right to update this Policy at any time in             the future.
