JobDiva, Inc.'s security precautions use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) methods to encrypt data. During data transfers, data are encrypted using HTTPS. JobDiva, Inc. is also equipped with an encryption mechanism for the data at rest. SHA-256 is used for passwords, and advanced database encryption is applied to key data elements, like HR-related data.
Password encryption is performed in such a way that even JobDiva, Inc.'s internal technology staff cannot read them. And to preserve password security, JobDiva, Inc.'s visitors are prompted to change their passwords every 90 days. In addition, JobDiva, Inc. disables a user's account after several unsuccessful logins attempts. JobDiva, Inc. also produces a CAPTCHA if it detects unusual suspicious activity.
JobDiva, Inc.'s software includes several layers of permission-based access. Thus, a particular login might be blocked from accessing certain data of a sensitive nature. Each JobDiva, Inc. web page accessed over HTTPS is also equipped with session validation to authenticate the user, and to prevent any data exposure without the proper login and permission.
JobDiva, Inc. also logs the access and activity of clients and maintains a report that could show unusual activity in the system.
Internal data access is permitted only for key JobDiva, Inc. members, and only for the purposes of data maintenance, updates, changes, releases and technical support. These members' employment agreements require them to uphold data privacy, data confidentiality and the terms of JobDiva, Inc.'s Privacy Policy.

JobDiva, Inc.'s Controller Privacy Policy
JobDiva, Inc. clients are controllers of the data that JobDiva, Inc., as a software and recruitment service provider, processes for them. EU and US JobDiva clients have overlapping responsibilities, outlined herein; the main differences appertain to the regulatory mechanisms to which their data subjects will need to turn. That JobDiva, Inc. clients control the data that JobDiva and its subsidiaries process means that such clients own, manage or leverage data, for which JobDiva, Inc. provides them the technological means. Controllers decide the purposes and ends of processed data.
As controllers, JobDiva, Inc. clients are expected to fulfill several responsibilities with respect to protecting the data they hold, and which JobDiva, Inc. processes.
Why Do Controllers Have Responsibilities?
It is extremely important that, in a world more permeated than ever by big data, data subjects trust those who process and control their information. More broadly, upholding data rights is both a business imperative and a legal necessity, and the failure to do so can result in major consequences.
JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries expect their clients to uphold their responsibilities as data controllers. The below terms appear in JobDiva, Inc.'s Terms of Service, which is part of JobDiva, Inc.'s service agreement with its clients. Failure by clients to conform could result in the termination of JobDiva, Inc.'s service.
Which Data for Data Subjects (You) Do JobDiva, Inc. Clients Manage and Control?
As described above, data subjects are those individuals whose data passes through JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries: JobDiva, Inc. clients' staff; applicants; candidates; hired employees; and customers of clients, their suppliers, partners and staff, and other third parties' staff with whom the JobDiva client interact in conducting theirbusiness. When controllers uphold the below principles, data security for JobDiva, Inc. data subjects is protected. Data subject types are detailed below.
·         JobDiva, Inc. Clients' Staff: JobDiva, Inc.'s clients' staff members will use JobDiva to make recruiting decisions and analyses. These rights apply to them, because their data is controlled in clients' specific JobDiva databases.
·         Applicants: When individuals apply to a job using a client's career portal, they become data subjects for the specific clients to whose portals they've applied. These rights apply to them.
·         Candidates: Candidates are data subjects whose resumes, CVs, on-boarding documents, payroll data or any other qualifying information have been obtained, stored and controlled by JobDiva clients in the clients' own databases. These rights apply to them.
·         Hired Employees: When individuals are hired by JobDiva, Inc.'s clients as employees, they become data subjects for those clients. Typically, these individuals are candidates and/or applicants first. Subsequently, JobDiva, Inc. clients can process payroll and benefit information about them by leveraging resources within JobDiva, Inc. These rights apply to them.
·         Customers of Clients, Their Suppliers, Their Partners and Their Staff and Other Third Parties' Staffing with Whom JobDiva, Inc. Clients Interact in Conducting Their Business: When the data related to individuals who count as customers, suppliers, partners and other third parties of JobDiva, Inc.'s clients are contained in JobDiva—"contacts" of "companies," in JobDiva, Inc.'s nomenclature—these individuals become data subjects for those clients. Then these rights apply to them.
Which Responsibilities Do Controllers Have?
·         Transparency: If data subjects request copies of the data that JobDiva, Inc. clients control regarding them, such clients must give the data subjects this information within thirty days of their requests—except in cases where the data subject's data contains proprietary client information or private data about other data subjects.
·         Access to Data: JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide at least two routes for furnishing copies of the data subjects' data. JobDiva, Inc.'s Candidate Portal websites let applicants and candidates access and edit certain information, such as contact information and availability, which JobDiva, Inc. clients will then retain. Secondly, JobDiva, Inc. clients can email or print, scan and mail or email data subjects information that is stored in their own client JobDiva, Inc. database—again, so long as the data does not contain the client's proprietary information or private data about other data subjects. JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide their clients the technological means for adhering to this Privacy Policy.
·         Choice and Correction of Data: If data subjects would like to update the information held about them by JobDiva, Inc. clients, and these updates would not impact the privacy of other data subjects, then such clients should make these changes within thirty days. JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide their clients the tools to execute such changes upon request by data subjects. JobDiva, Inc. also provides its clients with the tools that enable their data subjects to update information about themselves online. Clients are expected to hold only data that is relevant to their business purposes, for purposesconsistent with the reasons why it was acquired.
·         Public Notice: JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide their clients the ability to declare and announce their commitment to privacy—for instance, on their customized career portals. While JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries will provide their clients a public declaration of intent to protect privacy, JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries can only be responsible for JobDiva, Inc.'s actions and take no responsibility for the privacy practices of their clients. However, JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries volunteer to assist in the resolution of any dispute and reserve the right to terminate their services to any client who might violate the privacy of data subjects.
·         Purpose Limitation: If a JobDiva, Inc. client plans to use data subjects' data for purposes different from those that are either publicly defined or agreed upon between themselves and such data subjects, they must notify these data subjects. Such a notification must allow data subjects to choose whether their data should be used in the manner that the JobDiva, Inc. client has described.
What About Partnering with Third Parties?
Due to the requirements of the recruiting process, JobDiva, Inc. clients might partner with several types of third parties while hiring job candidates; JobDiva's software is responsible for technologically processing the personal information transmitted to such third parties. We do so in order to facilitate the recruitment process for our clients.
These types of third parties will usually include:
·         Benefits Companies: These companies provide benefits such as insurance and workman's compensation to candidates. Examples include Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna.
·         Background Check Companies: These companies check candidates' backgrounds for criminal and commercial records. Examples include Sterling BackCheck and easyBackgrounds.
·         Cloud Emails: These companies include cloud-based email inboxes. Examples include Gmail and Outlook 365.
·         Payroll Companies: These companies process payroll and human resources information. Examples include ADP and Paychex.
If a JobDiva, Inc. client partners with a third party, it is the client's responsibility to ensure that this third party will adhere to these privacy standards so far as they apply to the protection of data subjects' data. JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide the technological means for integration, while clients must verify the third parties' privacy terms.
Clients should opt to include terms for such adherence in contracts with third parties. Third-party processing of personal data should be limited to relevant business purposes. If a third party will not follow or stops following the privacy terms set out by the JobDiva, Inc. client, and by JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries, a JobDiva client should attempt to prevent all further control or processing of data subjects' data by the third party. Continued utilization of a violating third party by a JobDiva, Inc. client could because for termination of JobDiva, Inc.'s services.
Whenever JobDiva, Inc. clients decide to process data with a third party, they become responsible for monitoring and enforcing JobDiva, Inc.'s privacy policy with respect to the third party.  
Recourse Mechanisms for Controllers
JobDiva, Inc. clients must have recourse mechanisms. A data subject (you) has the right to recourse from the following mechanisms.
i.                     The complainant (a data subject who could be you) can lodge his or her complaint with the JobDiva, Inc. client. The JobDiva, Inc. client must reply within forty-five days. If the response fails to satisfy the complainant, he or she can lodge it with regulatory bodies.
ii.                   If a complainant is in the US, he or she can contact the US Federal Trade Commission and/or the US Department of Transportation with his or her complaint. If a complainant is in the EU/UK, he or she can contact his or her local Data Protection Authority (DPA). A JobDiva, Inc. client must provide the data subject and the relevant authority explanation and evidence, where possible, relating to their data protection practices. JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries pledge to assist in such communication under the direction of their client. Should an authority judge make a request for data or evidence, a JobDiva, Inc. client must cooperate with their ruling to the extent possible within twenty-five days of its issuance.
iii.                 If a complainant is not satisfied with these authorities' remedy for his or her complaint, he or she can pursue private arbitration with JobDiva, Inc.'s client and a private arbitration panel. JobDiva, Inc.'s client will abide by the arbitration panel's ruling. Note that such rulings will usually consist of determinations on data access, correction, deletion, or data relinquishment, and not monetary awards.
JobDiva, Inc. and its subsidiaries expect JobDiva, Inc. clients to faithfully follow through on all decisions handed down by regulatory bodies. If a client does not do so, they risk the termination of their JobDiva, Inc. service and possible legal action by the complainant.
