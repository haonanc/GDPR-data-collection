Who We Are
The Number 1 trusted site for police privacy and online safety for public officials and law enforcement officers.  We have successfully removed online personal information for thousands of officers and their families. We continue to protect all sworn law enforcement officers and public officialsâ€”one family at a time!
The Public Safety Assistance Foundation ("PSAF") is an IRS recognized California Non-Profit 501(c)(3)       organization. Through our subsidiary, PolicePrivacy.com, our mission is to assist all law enforcement       officers, public officials, and their families in facilitating, executing, and monitoring the complete       removal (also referred to as "opting-out") of their personal information from websites and information       databases, which sell and/or publicly post your confidential information.
Until recently, our services were exclusively for California law enforcement officers and public       officials. Due to the support by our affiliates and several police officer associations ("POA's"), we are       actively expanding and now providing services outside of California.
We Are Law Enforcement
As a law-enforcement directed company based in Southern California, we understand the necessity to keep your       information private. You are protected on the job, so why not be protected in cyberspace and at home! There       have been numerous documented instances of criminals obtaining the name and home address of police officers       using information resources readily available on the Internet. Sadly, some instances have involved in harm       or intimidation to police officers and their families.
Utilizing the authority enacted inside the specific states government code, PolicePrivacy.com is now       providing opt-out services and protecting the following states:

Colorado
Idaho

PSAF is continually searching and analyzing government legal code throughout each state. Further, our executive team and Board of Directors are constantly working with State and Federal agencies to adopt laws to protect the personal information of active and retired law enforcement officers and public officials. Our personalized Privacy Letter Package is INSTANTLY emailed to your personal email address. These customized and ready to mail letters demand the removal of you and your family's personal information from publically accessible information databases. As an added option we can even mail your opt-out letters directly to information databases within three (3) business days! Your privacy is our PRIMARY concern. Our website uses industry standard encryption, security, and anti-hacker certification.

I appreciate this service you have offered to me to help keep myself and my family safer. A lot of Police Officers don't know how easily anybody could get personal information about them and their families off the internet. This service is extremely valuable, and setting it up was quick and painless
