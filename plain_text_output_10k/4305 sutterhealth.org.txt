Our Personal Health Information Notice of Privacy Practices (“NPP”)
PLEASE NOTE: For information about how Sutter Health and its affiliates          may use and disclose medical information about you, how you can get access to this          information, and other rights under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability          Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), please review our Notice          of Privacy Practices .
Introduction
Sutter Health and its affiliates (“hereafter, “Sutter”), is committed          to providing you with quality health care and fostering a relationship built on trust.          This trust is built, in part, on our commitment to respect the privacy and confidentiality          of your personal information. This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes          how we collect, use, and disclose information that you submit to us or that we collect          through any Sutter website or mobile application that links to this Policy (collectively, “Sites”).
By accessing our Sites, including by registering for an account with us, when applicable,          you agree to the terms of this Policy, including the collection, use, and disclosure          of your information, as described in this Policy. Our Sites are intended for individuals          age 13 and older. By using our Sites you are affirming that you are 13 years old or          older. If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use our Sites.
Links to Outside Web Sites
Sutter's Sites have numerous links to outside Internet pages, including social          media platforms and Web sites which might have information on health topics of interest          to you. Sutter, however, does not sponsor or endorse any of these sites, nor does          Sutter make any guarantee, warranty or representation regarding the accuracy of the          information contained on the Web sites. In addition, Sutter has no control over the          privacy or security practices of external Web sites. You should read and understand          the policies of all Web sites with respect to these practices. These links are provided          for your general information and education only, and should NOT be relied upon for          personal diagnosis or treatment. If you have questions, please contact your clinician.
Collection of Personal Information
Sutter collects information about you, and sometimes about your devices, when you          visit our Sites. The information we collect and how we collect that information may          vary depending on the specific website or application. The information we collect          about you through our Sites generally is information that you provide or information          that we automatically collect. For example, you may provide information, including          personal information, in an e-mail or message to us, on a submission form, or through          another feature of one of our Sites. You will need to provide us with certain information          in order for us to create an account for you, as applicable. We also collect information          about you, and sometimes about your computer or device, automatically through cookies          and other technology. This is described in more detail below. In some cases, we may          collect location information from you, including your precise location, if you have          enabled this functionality for Sites. Most mobile devices allow you to change or disable          this functionality by changing the device settings. We also may collect information          regarding how you interact with our Sites and on other websites, such as our social          media platforms. For example, if you “like” a photo on one of our social          media sites, we may collect information related to that interaction. In some cases,          we may receive information about you from third parties. Once we receive this information,          we will use, disclose, and safeguard it as described in this Policy. We may combine          information collected through different Sites or portions of Sites. In the event we          combine personal information collected through our Sites with your personal health          information, we will use and disclose such combined information as described in our Notice of Privacy          Practices , which relates to our collection, use, and disclosure of medical information.          You may occasionally be asked to complete patient surveys. Sutter may analyze information          submitted via your account as part of descriptive (demographic) studies and reports.          In such cases, we will make reasonable efforts to remove patient-identifying information.
Web Site Visitor Tracking
Visitor Tracking Software
Sutter keeps track of visits to our Sites via an automatic monitoring program that          tells us, among other things, how many visits are made to the site; the time of day          and date of those visits; and which areas of the Sites individuals visited. The monitoring          program does not provide us with any personal information about a visitor. We cannot          discern your name or physical address or other personal information about you. This          information is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our Sites.
Web Logs
The visitor tracking software gathers information from standard Web logs and stores          it on servers at Sutter. These logs may contain information such as the Internet domain          from which you access our Sites; the date and time you visited our Site; the areas          of our site that you viewed; your computer's IP address that is automatically assigned          when you log onto the Internet; the type of browser and operating system you use;          and the address of the Web site you linked from, if any.
All Web logs are stored securely and may only be accessed by Sutter employees or          designees on a professional need-to-know basis for a specific purpose. Sutter uses          Web log information to help us design our Sites; identify popular features; resolve          user, hardware and software problems; and make the site more useful to patients and          other visitors.
Internet Cookies
Sutter may place Internet "cookies" on the computer hard drives of visitors to          our Sites. Cookies help us obtain information about your use of our Sites; they do          not contain information about you or your health history. Sutter uses two types of          cookies: "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.
A session cookie is temporary and expires after you end a session and close a Web          browser. We may use session cookies to help customize visitors' experiences on our          Sites, maintain a signed-on status while exploring the Sites and track which Web pages          visitors view on our Sites.
On the other hand, persistent cookies remain on your hard drive. For instance,          we use a persistent cookie when we ask you to agree to the use of the Multum Drug          Guide so that when you return to the guide, you do not need to go through the agreement          page again. Persistent cookies will not contain any personal information about you.
You may not be able to use or view some features of our Sites if you decline or          deactivate Internet cookies. For instructions on how to remove cookies from your hard          drive, go to your browser's Web site for detailed instructions. In addition, further          information regarding cookies may be available from your Internet service provider          or operating system provider. Some of our Sites may use Google Analytics to better          understand usage of our Sites. You may opt out of Google Analytics by following the          instructions at: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout .          Additionally, you may opt out of certain tracking by many third party advertisers,          by following the instructions found on the following Web sites: Network Advertising          Initiative, http://optout.networkadvertising.org and Digital Advertising Alliance, http://optout.aboutads.info.      
The collection, use, and disclosure of your information, as described in this Policy,          may continue regardless of whether or not you enable “Do Not Track” functionality          on your browser or device.

Accessing and Updating Other Personal Information
To request access to other personal information that we may have about you, or          to request changes to that information, you can contact us at SHPI@sutterhealth.org .          We will honor any legal right you may have to access such information, but fees, if          permitted by law, may apply. You will not be permitted to access another individual’s          personal information unless you have legal authority to do so. Requesting deletion          of your information may result in deletion of your account. In some cases, we may          be unable to update or delete your information, or may, in our discretion, deny a          request for access, amendment, or deletion of your personal information if we believe          doing so would violate our policies and procedures or legal requirements, or would          create inaccurate information.
Security Measures
Protecting your confidential health information is a top priority at Sutter. In          addition to applying confidentiality policies that govern access and use of information          by Sutter clinicians and staff, we have implemented physical, administrative, and          technical security features and methods designed to safeguard your data in our information          systems, including the use of, as appropriate, encryption, firewalls, monitoring,          access controls, and other controls where appropriate.
Protecting your username and password
It is extremely important that you keep any of your usernames and passwords for          Sutter Sites completely confidential. Anyone with access to your username and password          will be able to assume your online identity and view your information. For example,          anyone with access to your My Health Online username and password, will be able to          view your medical information, add comments to your record, and communicate with your          Sutter care team. It is your responsibility to prevent disclosure of your usernames          and passwords and to change your usernames and passwords if you feel that their security          has been compromised. You can change your password by logging into your account and          clicking the "Password Settings" link in the "Profile" section of the top menu, where          applicable. If you have any questions regarding the security of your password, please          call our patient services department at (866) 978-8837.
