Personal Information is information that can identify you as a specific individual (“Personal Information”). You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information. For example, you might provide us the following information: responses and survey information and/or site registrations, web portal registration information and payment information.

b. Non-Personal Information
When you visit any page on the Website, we use a program that monitors and evaluates the Website website’s traffic. It automatically records every visitor’s host, domain name, pages visited, length of user session, browser type and/or IP address. This information does not contain Personal Information. We use this information to find out how many people visit the Website to determine the areas of greatest interest on the Website, and to make improvements to the Website.
When you visit and interact with this Website, InstaMed and third parties with whom InstaMed has contracted to provide services to InstaMed, may collect non-personal information (for example, a catalog of the site pages you visit, or your IP address).
c. Cookies
As with many other sites, the Website may use “cookies” or other technologies to help us deliver content specific to your interests, to process your inquiries or requests, and/or to analyze your visiting patterns. Cookies, by themselves, will not be used by InstaMed to disclose your individual identity. This information identifies your browser, but not you, to our servers when you visit the Website. If you want to disable the use of cookies or remove them at any time from your computer, you can disable or delete them using your browser (consult your browser’s “help” menu to learn how to delete cookies), however you must enable cookies to access certain information on the Website. Note that in limited instances, such as when you create an online account, or request one of our other services, cookies may contain and be associated with the Personal Information we collect.
We may also collect data by using “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “pixel tags“) that allow us to know when you visit the Website. Through pixel tags, we obtain non-personal information or aggregate information (i.e., your IP address, the areas of this website you visit, your operating system, your browser version and the URL you came from) which can be used to enhance your online experience and understand traffic patterns.
3. Third-Party Advertisers
In addition, we may use third-party advertisers to serve or track advertisements on other websites. Please note that these third parties also may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to, among other things, enable such third parties to record which ads your browser has loaded and which site pages you may have been viewing when the ads were delivered or accessed. Use of such third-party sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy statements of those third parties. InstaMed does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

5. Disclosure of Your Personal Information
We disclose your Personal Information to certain third parties with whom we have a direct or indirect business or contract relationship, to provide the products and services you have requested.
When you request other services, we will provide your personal data to third parties with whom we arrange for those services to be provided. We may also disclose information to third parties that provide administrative or processing services for us, for example, printing, mailing, and/or payment processing.
InstaMed’s use of third parties to provide services to you (e.g., payment services) is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those third-party websites and such third parties are responsible or liable for their use of your personal data.

If you have consented to our doing so, we may also share your personal data with third parties in order that they may offer you information about their goods and services.
Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such information for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with Personal Information (such as embedding email addresses in cookies). If we do combine any non-personal information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information in accordance with this Statement.
Based upon your specific relationship(s) with InstaMed, we may disclose your Personal Information in ways described in more detail in one or more Other Agreements.

This Website may contain links to other third-party websites. InstaMed does not control the privacy statements or practices of these third-party sites. You should review those statements before providing any information. InstaMed is not responsible for the content or practices of any linked third-party sites, and we provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.

8. Security
InstaMed has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your Personal Information, but cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Statement (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or relevant Web statements).
If you register for a Web account, you will be asked to select a password to help protect your information. These passwords help us verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to any of your Personal Information. You should never disclose your password to anyone. InstaMed will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information.
When you provide credit card, debit card or bank account information, it is transmitted using SSL technology to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of that information. You will know that SSL is being used when you see a full yellow key in a blue box in the lower left-hand corner of your browser or a full “lock” in the status bar of your Internet Explorer browser.
