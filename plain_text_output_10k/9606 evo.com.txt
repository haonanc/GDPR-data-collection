Collection of Information
We collect information you provide us on servers located in the United States. We collect information when, for example, you create an online account with us, use our website and mobile features (together, “Services”), purchase or rent from us, enter the contests, promotions, events and newsletters we sponsor or otherwise provide us information about yourself. The type of information we collect may include:
Account information we may collect includes your name, postal and e-mail address, phone number, social media username(s), and any information you may share about your interests and preferences.
Transaction information we may collect includes account information as well as your credit card information and transaction history.
Information we may collect related to evo demos, events and sponsored trips includes, if and as applicable, health & fitness specifics, activity proficiency, dietary requirements and emergency contact information among other things.
We may also automatically collect information about you when you access or use our Services. Automatically collected data may include log-in information (browser type, access date & time, publisher IP, etc.), device information (hardware type/model, operating system and, if using evo’s in-store wifi network, browsing history) as well as your location information if required.  
In addition, we may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about you and your interaction with our Services, including information about your browsing and purchase behavior on our website and other interaction with our Services. We use this information in one or more of the ways described in the "Use of Information" section below. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but typically you can change your browser settings to remove or reject cookies. 
Use of Information
The information we collect is generally used to process your requests or transactions, provide you with the Services, personalize them to you and maintain and improve their quality, tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest, monitor and analyze your use and behavior patterns, and understand your needs so that we can serve you better. For example, we may use your telephone number, your e-mail or your postal address to communicate about opportunities and programs. If you prefer not to receive Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to request an update to your personal information on file or modify our use of it (see Your Choices below).
We store and process information on computer servers located in the United States.
Sharing of Information
We may share personal information about you outside of the evo family. For example:
We may provide to a third party certain information that is necessary to fulfill an order you have placed with us. For example, if you request shipment for a purchase, we may provide your address to the shipping carrier, and if you pay by a credit or debit card, your card number and sales transaction information are passed on to the card processor and/or issuer (including their service providers such as fraud verification services). However, we give vendors, suppliers, and others involved in the commercial distribution chain only the information needed to provide you the products or services you order, such as shipping and/or billing address, e-mail address, telephone number and product orders. Moreover, we require them to keep the information confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.
When you participate in the interactive areas of our Services, such as chat rooms, forums, message boards or news groups (if any), certain information about you may be displayed publicly on our Services and on third party sites, such as your photos, posts, and other information you choose to provide in your profile or during that session. We do not routinely monitor or retain logs or copies of these interactive areas, if any, that may be available on our Services. However, you should be aware that your use and disclosure of any information in these areas is governed by our Terms of Use .
We may also provide access to data that include your information in connection with the contemplated or actual financing, securitization, insuring, merger, sale or other encumbrance, divestiture or disposal of all or part of our business or assets, including for the purposes of determining whether to proceed with the transaction or fulfilling any records or other reporting requirements to relevant third parties. In the event of any actual transaction involving transfer of ownership or encumbrance, your personal information, among other things, may be transferred as part of the transaction.
We also may share your information when you specifically ask or authorize us to do so, or when we conclude disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, to enforce our agreements and policies, and where circumstances otherwise warrant doing so.

Third Party Advertising, Analytics and Services

This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third party technologies and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.
We also use a third party to "power" product reviews on our Services. When you submit a product review, you become subject to the terms of use and privacy policy of this third party, and the reviews you submit may be posted on our Services and on third party websites.
