For instance, when you create an account with us you may be required to provide a name, email address and birthdate in order for us to provide you with products and services through our Platforms. In addition, to provide you with a more individualized experience, like a personalized horoscope, astrology, tarot or numerology report, you may wish to provide your birth location, zip code, astrological sign, gender, and other related data. Where you choose to purchase products or services, including Karma Coins® tokens, gift certificates and expert readings, we will collect credit card (and PayPal) data such as credit card numbers, expiration date and billing address, but this data is sent directly to our payment processors and is never stored or otherwise retained by Daily Insight.
Data We Automatically Collect. When you interact with our Platforms we may collect data about you through automated means such as your mobile phone number, unique device ID, device type, machine ID, geolocation data, computer and connection data, browser type, IP address, domain name, and date and time stamps for your visits. We may also collect data associated with your use of our Platforms, including data about the way you interact with our Platforms or any content or advertising included on our Platforms, your page views and traffic to and from our Platforms, hyperlinks clicked, and the URL you visited before and after you use the Platforms. As is the case with most websites, we also employ cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and similar technologies within our Platforms to collect and store certain data about users, to improve our Platforms and advertising, and to help us remember you and your preferences when you revisit our Platforms. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information about what we automatically collect from you.
Data Collected by Third Parties. We may incorporate third party ads, offerings, and other technologies (such as plugins, pixels, and cookies) into our Platforms, enabling third parties to collect usage, demographic, and other data (including personal data) about you and your online activities through your use of our Platforms and across other websites and applications. Any data collected through such integrated ads or technologies is collected directly by those third parties for use and disclosure and is subject to the third party's privacy policies. Please see our Cookie Policy for more information about third party cookies.
Data Provided to Social Networking Sites. Some of our Platforms may offer you the ability to connect to your social networking accounts (“SNS”) such as Twitter or other social networking sites directly from our Platforms to the SNS or from the SNS to our Platforms. Where you choose to connect your account with a SNS we may receive or access data about you from the SNS if you post or otherwise share data on the SNS connected to your account. Please remember that any data you post to an SNS will be accessible by any users of the SNS and subject to the SNS's terms of service and privacy policy.
How We Use Your Data
We use your data to provide you with products and services including fulfilling orders (including process payment), responding to inquiries or customer service requests, administering your account, and displaying content based upon your interests. In addition, we may use your data to market our products, Platforms, promotions, and offers which we feel you may find interesting, provided you have not opted out of receiving such data or, where required by law, we have your express consent. We may also use your data to understand general customer trends and patterns and improve our Platforms.
How We Share Your Data
Third Party Service Providers. We may disclose your personal data to third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf including third parties that process payments; send marketing communications on our behalf; help us create or maintain our databases or help us research or analyze use of our Platforms. We require our service providers get your prior consent to use your data to market their own products or services to you directly. When we transfer any of your personal data to a service provider, the provider will be contractually required to use your data only to carry out the services we have requested, to provide appropriate protection of your data and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Third Party Partners. We may share data with our third party partners including advertising partners.  When we do, we will either aggregate (combine the data of numerous people together so that the data does not identify you) or de-identify (remove or change data to prevent association with you) your personal data so that the third party will not be able to associate that data to you, your computer, or your device.
SNSs and Third Parties Using Integrated Technology. As discussed above, data collected about you via third party ads, SNSs connected to your account, and other third party integrated technologies (such as plugins, pixels, and cookies) is collected directly by, and therefore disclosed to, the third party or SNS. Any such data is subject to the third party or SNSs privacy policy. Please see our Cookie Policy for more data about what we automatically collect from you.
To Comply with Legal Process. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal data as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us.
Third Parties to a Business Transaction. In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal data will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our Platforms for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal data.
Where we want to share data with third parties not described above, we will obtain your consent to do so.
