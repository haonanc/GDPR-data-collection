Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information from children under the age of 13. It also requires that we obtain parental consent before we allow children under the age of 13 to register as a member of the College Confidential community. The Website is primarily intended for use by high school and college aged teens and young adults and their parents, and is therefore not intended to be used by children under the age of 13. If you are a user who is under the age of 13, we must have permission from your parent or legal guardian before you can register as member of the Website.
A parent or legal guardian may ask College Confidential to provide them with the information we maintain about their child so that they may request corrections. This information will be sent via postal mail, which we believe is the most secure method of communication. Please contact College Confidential by email at admin@collegeconfidential.com or in writing at:
Attn: Security and Privacy Requests
College Confidential
Costa Mesa, CA 92627
We will need to verify the identity of anyone requesting information about a child to ensure that the person is in fact the child’s parent or legal guardian.
A parent or legal guardian may revoke consent to collect their child's personal information at any time, and they may also request to have their child's personal information deleted and refuse to permit further collection of such information by College Confidential. Please contact us using the process described above if you wish to have your child's information deleted. However, please understand that, even after removal, your child's content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or by others if a user has copied or stored such content.
Email Communications
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. For this reason, we try to keep emails to a minimum. We will send you email relating to your personal transactions, and we may send you service-related announcements on the rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. You may also receive certain marketing email communications from time to time, in accordance with your preferences, however, we will give you the ability to opt out of such email communications at any time.
Please understand that if you opt-out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with College Confidential.
Third Party Websites
When you are on our Website you may be able to visit or link to other sites not operated by us. We do not control such sites and we are not responsible for the information practices of these sites. This Privacy Policy does not address the information practices of those other websites, and we encourage you to read the posted privacy policies of such sites.
Disclosure of Information
We may disclose user information when compelled to do so by government authorities or otherwise as required or permitted by law, such as to respond to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interfering with our rights or property, other customers or users of the Website, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
Security
When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Website, such as the forums, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public. Therefore, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information to such areas of our Website, including your full name, home address, phone number, financial information or any other information that would enable other users to locate you or contact you.
Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email, SMS messaging or similar communications.

Updating Personal Information
Requests to change your user name or edit or delete posts will not be considered.  A user’s email address can be updated at any time by emailing admin@collegeconfidential.com with your user name, email address on file and new email address. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that require extraordinary technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical.
User accounts are personal to the registered user. In the event of the death of a user, the user’s account will be deactivated, however, existing content will not be removed from the forums. College Confidential cannot provide any personal information regarding the user or the account (including user name and password) to any family member, next of kin or legal representative without an order from a court of competent jurisdiction compelling College Confidential to do so.
