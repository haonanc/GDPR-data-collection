Log Activity for Statistical Analysis
Metro tracks activity and site function on its website in the form of log files on its web servers. These logs are analyzed by third-party statistical analysis software solutions such as Google Analytics , Wordpress - providing visitor activity trend data. The data gathered is used to better organize information contained onsite and to improve the user experience for our customers. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.
This information is not used to identify our visitors on an individual level.
Cookies and Web Beacons
Cookies are small files which can be placed on your computer by web servers when you visit certain sites; cookie placement helps us increase the website’s general effectiveness for visitors. These files may contain information such as ID's and passwords, personal information, or preferences. During your visit, the server can access these files to help personalize pages or allow you to affect e-commerce more easily. Metro does not set cookies from any page in the metro.net domain. Our e-commerce and lobbyist registration pages set cookies with login information only for the convenience of customers who use these areas repeatedly.
Metro uses third party advertisements to support our sites. Some of these advertisers (such as Google Adsense , Google Admob , Facebook , and other third-party sites) may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. Cookies are set and read by Google, Facebook, and other third-party sites. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Los Angeles real estate ads to someone in Los Angeles, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing travel ads to someone who frequents travel sites).
Metro also uses Adsense, Admob, Facebook or other third party remarketing, sometimes called retargeting, to market our website(s) across the Internet. Google, Facebook or other third party sites place a cookie on a browser. Google, Facebook or third-party sites read cookies and may present a Metro ad on a 3rd party site. You may opt out of Google’s remarketing by visiting the Google Ad Settings page . If you are concerned about 3rd party cookies presenting ads by Google and other ad networks, you may visit a broader opt-out page at the Network Advertising Initiative .

About Nextrip
Nextrip is a service designed to help take the guesswork out of bus and rail arrivals and help you to get to your stop at the same time as your bus or train. Nextrip uses satellite technology to find the specific location of a bus or train; then sends the estimated arrival time to a particular stop via cell phone, website or other mobile devices.
Nextrip uses Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology and advanced computer modeling to track buses and trains on their routes. Taking into account the actual position of the transit vehicles, their intended stops, and the typical traffic patterns, Nextrip predicts arrivals with a high degree of accuracy. Estimates are updated constantly as vehicles are tracked.
'Go Metro' Mobile App
The application uses your precise current location via GPS (global positioning system) or other network location sources like Wi-Fi and cell towers. In order to use these location services they must be turned on and available to your device. Location data provided by any external services (such as Google Maps or the Metro Trip Planner) is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed. Neither Metro, nor its agents, nor any of its content providers guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of stock information, location data or any other data displayed by any external services.
Metro does not collect or store personal information from customers downloading, installing or using our 'Go Metro' mobile applications for iPhone, iPad, or Android. Customers who want to provide feedback via the 'Report A Bug' button in the application have the option to provide contact information ONLY if they'd like a reply. Device model and a current operating system are collected for troubleshooting, this response is sent by email.
In the event the application crashes, a ‘crash log file’ is automatically generated and sent to Go Metro’s cloud server. Device model, current system version, time of the crash, and crash report (a text file which consists of errors/exceptions logs on what cause the app crashed) is collected for troubleshooting - no personal information is collected or sent to Go Metro cloud servers.
Event tracking is utilized to provide information for the My Metro feature and to support improved future application design. Various buttons, links, and actions are logged and sent to the Google Analytics server to determine feature usage, content usage, and app behavior. If a data connection is not available, data is temporarily stored on the device until a data connection is established, at which point, data is sent to Google Analytics servers - no personal information is collected or sent to Google Analytics .
The following is a complete list of all events the app is tracking and sending to Google Analytics :
Trip Planner: input text into the search box, opening the contacts list, performing a search, select 'Trip From', select 'Trip To', opens Nextrip arrivals, and opens a live map
Bottom Navigation: open My Metro, open Maps, open Menu, and open Map Options
