During your visit to any Affiliate Version, the Affiliate may independently collect other information from you.
This Policy does not describe THFG’s collection, use, and disclosure of information through means other than this Site (e.g., offline) or the collection, use, and disclosure practices of any third party, including Affiliates. For information on a third party’s information collection, use, and disclosure practices, please review the privacy policy on the applicable third party’s web site.

Web beacons may also be included in emails sent by THFG to determine when and if such emails are opened or forwarded. You may disable cookies or otherwise manage them through tools provided with your browser software and with third-party software packages. If you turn off cookies, many of the Site’s features will not work as well or at all. Anonymous information regarding usage of the Site and services that is collected and/or aggregated by or on behalf of THFG through the use of such technical means or otherwise is referred to in this Policy as “Usage Data.”

Information Sharing. THFG may share personally identifiable information that you provide with third parties in the following cases:

Requests. THFG maintains relationships with third party providers for some of the products and services offered through the Site. If you request information or services through the Site, you agree that THFG may share personally identifiable information with third parties as may be necessary to provide such information to or perform such services for you. For example, if you request information about a property advertised on the Site, THFG will share the information collected through such request with the owner(s) and/or agent(s) for property (or applicable designee) and any other parties providing that listing (e.g., if a third party real estate company or real estate agent provides the listing to us on behalf of the property owner(s)). In some cases, the information that you provide through the Site may be collected directly by a third party or its designee (e.g., through forms hosted by such third party or on a page framed with THFG branding). Personally identifiable information also may be shared with the specific third parties that can respond to your requests in the form of reporting and other follow-up communications. The subsequent use or disclosure of any information collected by or provided to third parties is subject to their privacy policies and practices.
Direct Marketing. Except as provided herein, it is THFG’s policy not to disclose personally identifiable information of its users to third parties specifically for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are 18 years of age or older and have affirmatively agreed to receive third party direct marketing materials, THFG may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Although THFG will endeavor to notify all third-party direct marketers that the information provided to them is confidential, the subsequent use or disclosure of information is subject to those third parties’ privacy policies and practices.
Service Providers. THFG may work with related and unrelated third parties that provide services on its behalf. Examples include providers of analytical, developmental, promotional, research, credit card processing, technology, support and other services. For example, THFG may work with third parties who host or operate the Site or may ask that a third party conduct an online survey or sweepstakes or send newsletters or other email communications on its behalf. Similarly, if you make a payment to THFG by credit card, THFG may share personally identifiable information and credit card information with a third party in order to process credit card transactions, or such information may be collected directly by the credit card processing service provider on THFG’s behalf. In such cases, THFG shall endeavor to require that the third party maintain personally identifiable information as confidential and use the information only to perform the services specified by THFG.
Sweepstakes/Promotions. In the event that you participate in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion on the Site, THFG reserves the right to share personally identifiable information collected in conjunction with the sweepstakes, contest or promotion with any third party sponsor or co-sponsor.

THFG reserves the right to share any personally identifiable information you post on the Site with third parties. To the extent THFG does so, the subsequent use and disclosure of such information is subject to the privacy policies and practices of those third parties.

In the case of these messages, THFG is not sharing your personally identifiable information with those third parties. THFG reserves the right to share Usage Data with Affiliates and any other third party for any reason.
Collection of Information by Third Parties. As noted in this Policy, Affiliates and other third parties may collect information about you when using the Site through the use of cookies and web beacons and/or other similar technologies. For example, we work with companies that collect statistical information regarding Site usage and provide related analytical services. Also, THFG uses third-party companies to serve advertisements when you visit the Site, to collect statistical information regarding Site usage, and to generate metrics related to the delivery of such advertisements. Third-party advertising companies may collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Site and other web sites in order to provide targeted advertisements about goods and services which may be of interest to you across their networks of web sites (which may or may not include this Site). These third parties also may use this information for determining or predicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences, for measuring the effectiveness of their advertising, and for other purposes. In addition, THFG may share statistical and behavioral data about visitors to the Site with these third-party advertising companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on the Site and/or on other web sites. For example, we use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise THFG across the Internet, in particular on the Google Search Network, to people who have previously visited the Site. These third-party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit on the Site through the use of web beacons. In the course of serving advertisements to you, these third-party advertising companies may also place or recognize a unique cookie on your computer to allow them to recognize web beacons and otherwise improve advertising effectiveness.
