Privacy Policy
Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable                     and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools,                     and opportunities with complete confidence.
The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of                     PERFECTORIGINS.COM. ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we                     gather about you while you are using the PerfectOrigins.com website (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, does                     not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and/or through                     other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of                     our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an                     evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case                     we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the                     policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such                     changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.
How We Collect and Use Information
We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while                     using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the                     Site). PerfectOrigins.com only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the                     event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of our events, or have                     purchased one of our products. PerfectOrigins.com collects personally identifying information from                     our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes                     name and email address for registration or opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and credit card                     information when registering for our events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.
We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through                     the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet,                     which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure                     traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie"                     to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on                     your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies                     help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and                     patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the                     Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons                     (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users                     who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.
We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways,                     including using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and,                     making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your                     information to third parties, such as service providers contractors and third-party publishers and                     advertisers for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described                     below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information                     collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to                     enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services. If you do                     not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online                     Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken                     off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to                     third-parties.
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for                     viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat                     areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be                     responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.
Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site                     also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These                     third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their                     advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other                     purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers                     is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.                     Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from                     ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons or use of your                     information, you should visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.
The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered                     by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or                     purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is                     governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such                     products or services.
We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site or by emailing                     messages to you through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of                     our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products and/or services.                     We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the                     course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In                     some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the                     privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information.                     The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions                     regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider                     partner directly for more information.
Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate                     to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the                     public.
Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event                     that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another                     company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.
