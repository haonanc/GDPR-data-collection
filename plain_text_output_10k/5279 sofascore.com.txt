INTRODUCTION
This privacy policy concerns the products of SofaScore (anything marked as ‘we, us, our’ and similar in this policy will refer to SofaScore) – our website www.sofascore.com and our mobile applications. In order to provide our services, we have to collect some personal data. This privacy policy explains what data do we collect, how and why do we process and keep it, how you can contact us and find out about your privacy rights, as well as show our commitment to protection of your information.
DATA CONTROLLER AND OWNER
Our Data Controller is SofaScore Ltd., the owner of www.sofascore.com. You can contact us by e-mail on the address [email protected]
THIRD-PARTY LINKS
Please do keep in mind that we aren’t in control of the data our partner websites collect and share. While we are committed to guarding your privacy and safety in every way possible, if you’re leaving sofascore.com by clicking on a plug-in or a link you find on our site, personal data they collect is out of our hands. We strongly recommend you to read the privacy policies of those sites first.
Types of Data collected – what do we collect?
COLLECTED DATA
Among the types of personal data that we collect, by itself or through third parties, are: Email, Cookie and Usage Data.
If we need any other personal data collected at some point, it will either be described in other sections of this privacy policy or by dedicated explanation text contextually with the data collection, meaning you will be asked and fully informed about it. That means the personal data we collect may be freely provided by the user, or collected automatically when using this our application or website.
USER ACCOUNT
In order to provide a better service for our users, we have — for a long time — had a feature of user account. Now, with your privacy more important than ever before, we are clarifying the way your personal data concerning user account is collected and stored.
Personal data refers to information that can identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, or any data you provide while using SofaScore user account. Our login providers (Facebook or Google) provide us with some of your personal data — name, surname, e-mail — upon your login to our services. However, your personal information of that kind will never be sold or rented to anyone, for any reason, at any time. We will not store this information in any available database. This information will only be used to easier fulfill your requests for service, such as providing access to your in-app stats and features, and to enforce our Terms of Use.
NOT-COLLECTED DATA
At no point do we collect personal or sensitive personal data that could lead to a person being positively identified. Also, we never collect the data about race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union memberships, genetic or biometric data, health or mortality, sex life or sexual orientation, unless we are legally required by the court of law to do it.
Mode and place of processing the Data – how do we collect?
METHOD OF PROCESSING
Our Data Controller processes the data of our users in proper manner and shall take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification or unauthorized destruction of the data.
The data processing itself is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Data Controller, in some cases, the data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of the site (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as data processors.
What is important is that the updated list of these parties may be requested from the Data Controller at any time, so you will always know who is in charge.
PLACE OF PROCESSING
The data is processed at the Data Controller’s operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved with the processing are located. For further information, please contact the Data Controller.
CONSERVATION TIME
We keep the data for the time necessary to provide the service requested by the user, or stated by the purposes outlined in this document. You can always, at any time, and for any reason, request the Data Controller for the suspension or removal of your data.
The use of the collected Data – why do we collect?
The data concerning the user is collected to allow us to provide our services, as well as for the following purposes: contacting the user and displaying content from external platforms.
CONTACTING THE USER
Personal Data collected in this case is your e-mail address.
By registering to the mailing list or to the newsletter, the user’s email address will be added to the contact list of those who may receive email messages containing information of commercial or promotional nature concerning our product.
