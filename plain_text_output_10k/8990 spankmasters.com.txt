Do Not Track Policy
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser. DNT is a way for                         you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage                         visits collected over time and across websites or online services. The Company is committed to                         providing you with meaningful choices about the information it collects and that is why the                         Company provides you the ability to opt out. But the Company does not recognize or respond to                         any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it                         means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.
