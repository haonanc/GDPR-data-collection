Consent
By using the Site or Services, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Site or Services.
Collection of Personal Information
Certain Personal Information (information which can identify you) is required to create and maintain a Quikly user account. This includes your full name, email address, and cell phone number. Quikly or its payment provider may also collect credit, debit or other billing account information. You may choose not to provide certain Personal Information, but this may prevent you from receiving our services.
If you choose to use Quikly’s social networking functions, we may collect your user ID and password information for the social networking site(s) you choose to connect with. We will do so only as necessary to make it easier for you to post to such site(s) or to log in using your social networking credentials from such site(s). By participating in this feature, you understand that you are authorizing us to use any other information, including Personal Information, on your linked social networking accounts. While we do not store social network passwords on our servers, we may store any other social network-related information from the sites that you choose to connect with via our Site or Services.
Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, you may use "Facebook Connect" to interact with friends, share on Facebook through your Wall and through friends' News Feeds, and opt or log in to a campaign or account. If you are already logged into Quikly and Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to merge your profiles. By proceeding, you are allowing us to access your name, email address, sex, and date of birth, to the extent you have made or make those facts available to Facebook.
You can edit privacy settings or disconnect the Facebook Connect service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.

Disclosure of Personal Information
Your Personal Information will be shared with the Merchant(s) affiliated with the particular Quikly campaign(s) to which you opt-in to participatefor their own use subject to their own privacy policies. You should review each Merchant’s privacy policy before deciding whether to participate in such Merchant’s campaigns. If you later decide that you do not want that Merchant to use your information any more, you will need to contact the Merchant directly, as we have no control over how Merchants use information after they receive it in a campaign.
We also may disclose Personal Information to companies, agents, contractors, service providers or others engaged to perform functions on our behalf (such as processing of payments, provision of data storage, hosting of our website, marketing of our products and services, conducting audits, and performing web analytics) to deliver Services you request; in such cases, the vendor will only be authorized by us to use your Personal Information to assist us in delivering the Services you have requested, and not for any other purpose.
We also may disclose your Personal Information to third parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:

Please also note that, if you sign in or link to the Site or Services through any social networking service, such as Facebook, any information you supply (or have supplied) to us becomes subject to the privacy policy of that social network/service.

We also may share your Personal Information with trusted marketing partners for their own direct marketing to you separately from any Merchant-sponsored Quikly campaign you may opt into.

Collection of Non-Personal Information
Quikly (or third parties that have content embedded on the Site or Services such as a social feature) may also collect from you aggregate, non-individually identifiable or demographic information (“Non-Personal Information”). An example of Non-Personal Information would be system-related information such as IP addresses, use information, browser and browser speed, bandwidth of your Internet connectivity, general location of your device or server and the pages of our Site that were viewed during a visit.
Use and Sharing of Non-Personal Information
We use Non-Personal Information for internal purposes to help us diagnose problems, monitor traffic patterns and otherwise continually improve our Services, and we may otherwise use or share Non-Personal Information for any lawful purpose in our sole discretion.
Cookies and Automatic Information Gathering Technologies
We use cookies and other technologies, such as pixel tags, web beacons, and clear GIF files, to help manage our online advertising program. These technologies help enable us (or third party advertising services we work with) to learn which advertisements bring users to the Services. They also may enable us (or third-party advertising services we work with) to track the actions of users online over time and across different web sites or platforms to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver electronic advertisements that may be more relevant to individual consumers and that will improve the consumer experience. You have the option to select “do not track” settings in your browser. The Site does not currently place ads based on such tracking. Accordingly, the Site does not respond to “do not track” requests at this time. In the event tracking-based ads are placed in the future, we will update this policy to explain how the Site will respond to “do not track” requests. For information about how tracking works for online advertising purposes, and what happens when you elect a do-not-track option, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices .
International Users
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from users residing outside the United States. We do not authorize anyone residing outside of the United States to use Quikly. If we learn that you reside outside the United States, we will deactivate your account and delete all of your account data from our systems. We reserve the right to store data inside or outside the United States, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
Children
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from users under 13 years of age. We do not authorize users under the age of 13 to use Quikly. If we learn that you are a child under the age of 13, we will deactivate your account and delete your data from our systems.
Information Security
We utilize reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information. For example, we utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology when data is transmitted over the Internet, we have installed firewalls to help prevent external access into our network, and we use password protection and IP recognition for login. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet and no method of data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security.
