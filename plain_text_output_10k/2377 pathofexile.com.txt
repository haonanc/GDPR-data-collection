About our GDPR Legal Documents Update
The new European privacy regulations called GDPR have come into effect. In layman's terms, the GDPR requires companies to store as little data as possible, have a good legal basis for all data they store, store the data securely, and not share it with anyone unless it's strictly required. We have updated our legal documents to make it clearer what personal data we store and why.

PATH OF EXILE - PRIVACY POLICY:  GDPR TERMS
EU additional terms: If you are based in the European Union (“EU”) and use any of the Website, Materials and Services, these additional terms (“GDPR Terms”) form part of Grinding Gear Games’ Privacy Policy. The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regulates the collection, processing and transfer of EU individuals’ personal data (as defined in the GDPR). The personal information described in our privacy policy is personal data under the GDPR. Grinding Gear Games is committed to complying with the GDPR when dealing with personal data of our website visitors and service users based in the EU. For the purposes of the GDPR, Grinding Gear Games is the data controller (as defined in the GDPR) when processing personal data collected by it when you use any of the Website, Materials and Services. These GDPR Terms were drafted with brevity and clarity in mind. They do not provide exhaustive detail of all aspects of Grinding Gear Games’ collection and use of personal data. However, Grinding Gear Games is happy to provide any additional information or explanation needed. Any requests for further information should be sent to support@grindinggear.com.
Processing personal data: The personal data Grinding Gear Games may process consists of the personal information described in its Privacy Policy. This personal data may be processed for the purposes outlined in that privacy policy. The legal basis for Grinding Gear Games’ processing of personal data depends on the type of personal data and the specific context in which it collects it. However, Grinding Gear Games normally processes personal data only where (a) it has your consent to do so, (b) where it needs to process personal data to perform a contract with you (e.g. to provide the Website, Materials or Services to you), or (c) where the processing is necessary for the purposes of Grinding Gear Games’ legitimate interests (except where such interests would be overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms which require the protection of personal data).
Despite the above, Grinding Gear Games may process any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance with applicable laws.
You do not have to provide Grinding Gear Games with some information that is automatically collected when you use any of the Website, Materials and Services, e.g. cookies. However, you must provide us with (a) your email address and username or (b) a username and Steam Account ID when using the Materials and Services. The consequence of not providing one or the other of these is that Grinding Gear Games will not be able to set you up a Member Account in order to log into the Website or PoE.
Your rights: Your rights in relation to your personal data under the GDPR include:
right of access - if you ask Grinding Gear Games, it will confirm whether it is processing your personal data and provide you with a copy of that personal data.
right to rectification - if the personal data Grinding Gear Games holds about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to have it rectified or completed. Grinding Gear Games will take every reasonable step to ensure personal data which is inaccurate is rectified. If Grinding Gear Games has shared your personal data with any third parties, it will tell them about the rectification where possible.
right to erasure – Grinding Gear Games will delete your personal data when it is no longer needed for the purposes for which you provided it. You may request that Grinding Gear Games delete your personal data and it will do so if deletion does not contravene any applicable laws. If Grinding Gear Games has shared your personal data with any third parties, it will take reasonable steps to inform those third parties to delete such personal data.
right to withdraw consent - if the basis of Grinding Gear Games’ processing of your personal data is consent, you can withdraw that consent at any time.
right to restrict processing - you may request that Grinding Gear Games restrict or block the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. If Grinding Gear Games has shared your personal data with third parties, it will tell them about this request where possible.
right to object to processing - you may request that Grinding Gear Games stops processing your personal data at any time and it will do so to the extent required by the GDPR.
right to data portability - you may obtain your personal data from Grinding Gear Games that you have consented to give it or that is necessary to perform a contract with you. Grinding Gear Games will provide this personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format to enable data portability to another data controller. Where technically feasible, and at your request, it will transmit your personal data directly to another data controller.
