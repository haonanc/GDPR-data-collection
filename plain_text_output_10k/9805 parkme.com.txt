The steps we take to protect  that information.

How we transfer your  information.
How we may make changes to our  Privacy Policy.

INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT
We gather and use Personal Information about you through the App as described below. “Personal Information” means any information about an identified or identifiable individual.
1. Information you provide directly to us
Account information.  You may create an account in our App by registering in “Settings” with an email address and password.
Reports: You may report issues with our maps to us, so that we can improve them.  We will not disclose such reports to other App users.
Your contact information: We may use the contact information you provide to us to communicate with you, including through e-mail communications, mobile text messages, in-App messages, and push notifications.  For example, we may use your email address, phone number, or other information that you provide to us (i) to contact you to verify your email address or phone number; (ii) to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service, to respond to your inquiries, to manage your account, or otherwise provide user support; and (iii) to provide service-related messages such as notifications, confirmations, updates, and security alerts.  Where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent to send you marketing communications by electronic means.
Payment-related information.  We may ask you to provide us with information we need to enable you to pay for certain services or offers using the App.  This information may include information about your payment card and billing address.  If we collect this information from you, we will use a trusted third-party payment processor to process your payments, and will allow you to review your payments in the App.
2. Information we obtain from your use of our App
Location.  We will only collect geo-location information with your authorization and as permitted by your device settings, and we will only use it in accordance with this Policy.  You may at any time opt-out of the collection of your location information via your device settings.  Turning off the collection of your location information will result in not receiving data for your specific location.
Other usage information.  When you use our App, we may record certain information from your device and your use of the App, such as feature usage and account status. We may use that information in de-identified form for analytics purposes.
HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
We do not sell or rent your Personal Information to marketers or third parties.  We may, however, share or disclose your Personal Information as follows:
Members of our group. We may share your Personal Information to any members of our group,  which includes our affiliates, subsidiaries and branch offices, to  which it is reasonably necessary or desirable for us to disclose  your Personal Information in order to carry out the above-mentioned  information processing purposes.
Service providers.   We may share your Personal Information with service providers who  perform services on our behalf.  When we work with service  providers, we require them by contract to only use or disclose the  Personal Information they process on our behalf as necessary to  perform certain services on our behalf or comply with legal  requirements.
Compliance with laws and law  enforcement. We will  share your Personal Information if we, in our good faith judgment,  believe it is necessary to: (i) investigate and defend ourselves  against any third-party claims or allegations; (ii) comply with laws  and legal process (including valid subpoenas, court orders, or  government requests); (iii) take precautions against liability and  protect the property, rights, and safety of our company, our App  users, or others as required or permitted by law; (iii) enforce our  Terms of Use or other agreements; (iv) prevent or stop activity we  believe to be illegal, fraudulent, abusive, unethical or legally  actionable; and (v) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, the  security or integrity of our App or equipment used to make the App  available, or any other technical issues.
Business Transfers.   If our business is involved in a merger, acquisition,  reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy, your Personal  Information may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an  acquirer, or successor or assignee. Should such operation occur, we  will use reasonable efforts to direct the acquirer to use your  Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this  Privacy Policy. Following such operation, you may contact the entity  to which we transferred your Personal Information with any inquiries  concerning the processing of that information.
Other  Disclosures.   We may disclose your Personal Information in other ways when we  have your consent to do so.
We may share statistical data that does not identify you with App users and third party partners for reporting purposes e.g., to derive or report on traffic flows.
YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES
Subject to applicable law, you may have the right to request access to and receive information about the Personal Information we maintain about you, update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, and have the information blocked or deleted, as appropriate.  The right to access Personal Information may be limited in some circumstances by local law requirements. You also have the right to withdraw your consent to the collection of your Personal Information.  You may at any time stop the collection of your information via the settings of your device, or by uninstalling the App.  Note however that if you exercise your right of blocking or deletion, if you decline to share certain Personal Information with us, or if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionalities of the App.
If you receive promotional messages from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the opt-out instructions contained within the message.  Even after you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, you may continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding the App.  You may turn off push notifications through your device settings.
To exercise your rights and choices to your Personal Information, please visit the settings section in the App or contact us by using the contact details provide below under “Our Contact Information”.
INFORMATION SECURITY
We maintain technical and organizational measures intended to protect the Personal Information we obtain about you through the App against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.
THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND CONTENT
Our App may provide links to other websites for your convenience and information.  These websites may operate independently from ParkMe.  Linked websites may have their own privacy notices or policies, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites.  To the extent any linked websites you visit are not owned or controlled by ParkMe, we are not responsible for the websites’ content, any use of the websites, or the privacy practices of the websites.
INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or other region with laws governing data collection and use that differ from those of the United States, please note that your information, including your Personal Information, may be transferred to countries located outside the EEA, in particular to the United States, and those countries may not have the same level of protection as the country in which you initially provided that information.  When we transfer your Personal Information we will protect it as described in this Policy.
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.  When we do, we will post the revised policy in the App, and the revised version will be effective when it is posted.  If we make any material changes to this policy, we will notify you of such changes, and we will indicate when such changes will become effective.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy and the way in which we handle your Personal Information, or to exercise your rights and choices, please contact us at:
ParkMe
Effective Date: 8-15-13
ParkMe,   Inc. ("ParkMe") provides  this notice explaining our online information practices and the way  your personal information is collected and used. If you do not agree  with the practices explained in this policy, do not use our Mobile  Applications or Website (collectively, the “Service”), and, if  you have registered an account with us, disable your account through  the Service or ask that your registration be cancelled by emailing us  at info@parkme.com .  This policy applies only to information ParkMe collects from you in  connection with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you  agree to accept the practices and terms set forth in this Privacy  Policy. Capitalized terms not defined in this policy shall have the  meaning set forth in the  ParkMe  EULA .
Personally    Identifiable Information
Registration   is required to access certain features of the Service. As part of the   registration process you may be asked for limited personal and   demographic information and may be required to choose a username and   password that will give you access to the Service. While most of the   information we collect is used internally for site analysis and   improvement, some of the demographic information in your registration   data is used in compiling reports that we may disclose to our   partners as part of our business. However, except as stated in   Section 2 below, ParkMe will never disclose or associate with your   usage of the Service any of your personally identifiable information,   which consists of the following: name, postal address, telephone   number, fax number, e-mail address, username.
Use    and Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information
ParkMe   does not rent or sell to advertisers personally identifiable   information, such as your name or e-mail address.  ParkMe may use   your personally identifiable information:
To    deliver you the Service and send you notices related to the Service,    your account and necessary updates. This includes fulfilling your    requests for products and services.
To     e-mail you our newsletter, promotions and special offers from us and     our partners. You may remove yourself from this list at any time by     following the link in the e-mail that we send to you or by     unsubscribing in an account management area we may make available.
To      manage your Account and Account access, provide you with Content,      purchase confirmations, support and customer service and to keep      track of support and customer service requests.
To       determine the technical capabilities of your device and the       appropriate Content to deliver to you.
ParkMe   may disclose personally identifiable information to its partners in   order to provide the Service, resolve service problems and correct   errors in the Service (including customer inquiries, billing and   credit corrections), to communicate with you about the Service, to   provide you with advertising and promotional information in   connection with the Service, and to enhance your experience on the   Service. However, these companies do not have an independent right to   share this information. Due to our contractual obligations with these   third parties and the need to share personally identifiable   information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you   with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing personally identifiable   information with these third parties. ParkMe does not store   customers' credit card information, and all credit card orders and   information are transmitted securely for processing.
Your   personally identifiable information may be provided to a third party   if ParkMe files for bankruptcy, or there is a transfer of the assets   or ownership of ParkMe. ParkMe may also disclose personally   identifiable information in order to respond to a subpoena, court   order or other similar request pursuant to a lawsuit or regulatory   proceeding, to establish or exercise our rights, or defend against or   bring legal claims. ParkMe may also use or disclose such personally   identifiable information in order to investigate, prevent and take   action regarding fraud or misuse of the Service, to comply with law   or in response to a law enforcement agency's request, to enforce our   Privacy Policy, the ParkMe EULA, or any other agreement between you   and ParkMe, and to protect the rights, property and safety of the   Service, Users and others.
Publicly    Available Information
Any   and all Content you submit or otherwise upload through the Services,   including personally identifying information, may be viewed or used   by other users, and ParkMe, its partners, and each of their   contractors and employees may view or use that Content to provide the   Service and otherwise perform the tasks set forth in this Privacy   Policy.  Any information, including personally identifying   information, that you may reveal in public portions of the Service or   in communications with other Users, in online discussions, opinion   boxes, or forums, is generally open to the public and is not in any   way private.
You   should think carefully before publicly disclosing any personally   identifiable information, or other information that you consider   sensitive or confidential. What you have written may be seen and/or   collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are   unable to control or predict.  Further, we may be unable to remove   such information from the Service or prevent others from collecting   or disclosing that information elsewhere.
Non-Personally    identifiable and Aggregate Information
The   non-personally identifiable information that we may gather includes   your gender, age, zip code, country or territory of residence,   Internet Protocol (IP) address (as discussed below), the type of   browser that you use, the type and nature of the content that you   upload to the Service and access from the Service, the comments and   communication that you enter into the Service, the links and   transactions with us and with third-parties that you enter into via   the Service, and other aspects of your use of the Service. ParkMe   uses this information to improve the Service, conduct research, to   analyze your and other User's interest in the areas of the Service,   to tailor advertising and content displayed to you and other Users,   to inform our partners, suppliers, and information providers about   the use of the Service, and to inform our advertisers about the   number and demographic composition of Users that have viewed their   advertising. To do this we may combine information that we have about   you with information that we obtain from business partners or other   companies. We may also release aggregate demographic information   about User trends to partners and other third parties, including   third-party advertisers on the Service. An example of this type of   information would be patterns of use of the Service based on zip code   or age group. We also retain aggregated log files of requested   Content in order to report overall product usage to content partners   and to evaluate User trends.
Generally,   an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a   “dynamic” address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband   connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible   that your IP address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we   use, may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This   is because with some broadband connections your IP address doesn’t   change (it is “static”) and could be associated with your   personal computer.  We will not provide your IP address to   third-party advertisers.
Data    Security
ParkMe   uses reasonable precautions to keep user information secure. To   prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the   appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate   physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and   secure the information we collect. However, due to the open nature of   communication through the Internet, we cannot guarantee that   communications between you and the Service, and the Service and you,   will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Users of the   Service do so at their own risk. ParkMe  cannot guarantee the security of any information that is disclosed  online.  We recommend that you use “strong” Account passwords and  your best efforts to protect the privacy and security of your Account  information.  ParkMe is not responsible for any unauthorized access  to your Account or any information obtained through such unauthorized  access.
Third    Party Websites and Payment Processing
The   Service may contain links to other web sites or form part of the   offering of those web sites. ParkMe is not responsible for the   privacy policies of these sites. If you provide any information to   such third parties different rules regarding the collection and use   of your personal information may apply. You should review such third   party's privacy policies concerning any their use of data you provide   to them.
ParkMe   handles all payments through third-party payment processors.   Information you submit in connection with making a payment through   the Services is transmitted directly to the payment processor and   will not be retained by ParkMe.  You understand that any online   transactions you submit through a payment processor are between you   and that payment processor, and ParkMe is not responsible for the   actions or omissions of the third-party payment processor.  YOU AGREE   THAT YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS PARKME AND ANY OF ITS   OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES OR PARENTS,   AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF A   THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR.
Children
ParkMe   does not knowingly collect personal information from children under   the age of 13. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use   the Service nor to submit any personal information to the Service.   Because ParkMe does not collect information regarding children under   the age of 13, ParkMe does not knowingly use or distribute personal   information regarding children under the age of 13. If ParkMe obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child  under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted  from our database, and any associated Accounts will be terminated.
Cookies    and Other Data
ParkMe  may install cookies on your computer when you use the Service, either  itself or through a third party.  Cookies are small files that store  and may track information about your use of the Service.  ParkMe may  use cookies to recognize you as a repeat user of the Service, log you  into your account, provide Content you may find interesting, or  otherwise improve your use of the Services.  Most web browsers  automatically accept incoming cookies, so by using the Service you  agree to the installation of cookies from ParkMe.  We feel  that the use of cookies enhances the operation of our site, but they  are not required. You will be able to use the core features of the  Service with cookies blocked.  Cookies may be deleted and/or blocked  through your web browser.
As   is true of most websites and mobile applications, ParkMe gathers some   information automatically and stores it in log files. This   information includes IP address, browser type and language, Internet   service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system,   date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information   to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn   about user behavior on the site, to gather demographic information   about our user base as a whole, and to measure the effectiveness of   our customer communications. We may use this information in our   marketing and advertising services. 
We   may also collect information about when or whether you open our   emails or promotional materials, and may use “click-through URLs,”   linked to particular content on the Service.  We use this information   to assess customer interest in particular topics and the success of   our marketing and promotional efforts.  If you prefer not to be   tracked in this way, please do not click on any text or graphic links   in our email messages.  
U.S.    - EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement 
For   personal information of employees, consumers, healthcare   professionals, medical research subjects and investigators,   customers, investors, and government officials that ParkMe receives   from the European Economic Area, ParkMe has committed to handling   such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor   Principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles,   please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Website at http://export.gov/safeharbor/ .  
Reasonable    Efforts
We   will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and   will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to   comply with our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions of   our products and services, which are further refined before the   release of the final version. Because these products and services are   still in a test phase, we may not always discover an unintended   privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome User   feedback on any privacy concerns you may have. In light of the above   and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our   technology and business, and the security risks associated with using   the Internet or mobile applications, ParkMe does not guarantee   error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. TO THE EXTENT   PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ParkMe SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,   CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY ALLEGED VIOLATION   OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, and ParkMe’s TOTAL LIABILITY FOR SUCH   ALLEGED VIOLATION SHALL BE ANY PAYMENTS MADE BY YOU TO ParkMe FOR   YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE (i.e., payments for our mobile application or   subscription fees, if applicable).
Modifications    of the Privacy Policy
ParkMe   reserves the rights to modify its Privacy Policy at any time and will   notify you by posting an amendment to the Privacy Policy on the   Service. If you have established an Account, we will attempt to   inform you of any modifications to this Privacy Policy that affect   your obligations to ParkMe or our obligations to you. If you do not   agree with any such modifications, your sole remedy is to terminate   your Account and to cease using the Service. You may request to   terminate your Account by emailing a request to  info@parkme.com ,  and we will use our commercially reasonable best efforts to remove  your Account information from our database within thirty (30) days.
Any   modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective as to you upon   ParkMe posting the new Privacy Policy and/or implementation of any   changes on the Service. You agree to review this Privacy Policy   periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your   continued use of the Service after any modifications indicates your   acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.
