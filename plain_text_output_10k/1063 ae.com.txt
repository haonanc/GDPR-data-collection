Introduction
Our privacy policy describes the ways in which we collect, store, use and protect your personal information and it is important for you to review this privacy policy. By "personal information" we mean information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person.
We do not consider anonymised information to constitute personal information as it cannot be used to identify a specific person. We collect personal information from you when you use iP-ae.com or its related websites and services ("Site") (including, without limitation, when you buy items or participate in auctions or when you telephone or email our customer support team). By providing us with your personal information you expressly consent to us processing your personal information in accordance with the terms of our privacy policy.
We may amend our privacy policy at any time by posting a revised version on the Site. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it and, following such posting, your continued use of the Site will constitute your express consent to us continuing to process your personal information in accordance with the terms of our revised privacy policy.
We would encourage you to check the Site regularly for the announcement of any amendments to our privacy policy.
